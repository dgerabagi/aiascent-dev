<M3. Interaction Schema>
# Artifact A52.2: DCE - Interaction Schema Source
# Date Created: C156
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C6 (Clarify closing tag and add curator activity section)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** The canonical source text for the M3. Interaction Schema, which is injected into all generated prompts.
- **Tags:** documentation, process, interaction schema, source of truth

## Interaction Schema Text

1.  Artifacts are complete, individual texts enclosed in `<xmltags>`. To ensure consistent parsing by the DCE extension, all file artifacts **must** be enclosed in `<file path="path/to/file.ts">...</file_artifact>` tags. The path must be relative to the workspace root. **The closing tag must be exactly `</file_artifact>`.** Do not use the file path in the closing tag (e.g., `</file path="...">` is incorrect). Do not write the closing tag as `</file>` or `</file_path>`. Only `</file_artifact>` will parse successfully.

2.  Our Document Artifacts serve as our `Source of Truth` throughout multiple cycles. As such, over time, as issues occur, or code repeatedly regresses in the same way, seek to align our `Source of Truth` such that the Root Cause of such occurances is codified so that it can be avoided on subsequent cycles visits to those Code artifacts.

3.  Please output entire Document or Code artifacts. Do not worry about Token length. If your length continues for too long, and you reach the 600 second timeout, I will simply incorporate the work you did complete, and we can simply continue from where you left off. Better to have half of a solution to get started with, than not to have it. **Preference is for larger, more complete updates over smaller, incremental ones to align with the human curator's parallel processing workflow.** The human curator often sends the same prompt to multiple AI instances simultaneously and selects the most comprehensive response as the primary base for the next cycle, using other responses as supplementary information. Providing more complete updates increases the likelihood of a response being selected as the primary base.

4.  Do not output artifacts that do not require updates in this cycle. (Eg. Do not do this: // Updated on: Cycle 1040 (No functional changes, only cycle header))

5.  **Critical: `flattened_repo_v2.txt` contains all project files. Output updated *individual* files that are part of it (like `<src/state/coreStore.ts>...`). However, do **NOT** output the surrounding Artifact container tags (`<flattened_repo_v2.txt>...</flattened_repo_v2.txt>`) or any auto-generated metadata sections within it (like the Total Files summary, Top 10 list, or the `<files list>` section) which are created by the `flatten.js` script.**
5.1. `flattened_repo_v2.txt` is a copy of the codebase, generated by a script; assume its an accurate representation of the existing codebase, but not necessarily a 'source of truth' like we treat our documents as, our codebase is a living artifact, documents, while we can update them, should be considered less transient.
5.2. **`.local` File Convention:** To manage token count, some large data files (e.g., `researchNodes.ts`) may be represented by a truncated `.local.ts` version in the context. This version contains the essential structure and a few examples. If the full content of a file is required for a task (e.g., a comprehensive data refactor or fixing a bug related to a specific entry), explicitly state this need in your summary of actions and request that the curator swap the `.local.ts` file with the full `.ts` version in the `files_list.txt` for the subsequent cycle.

6.  remember to output complete artifacts without placeholders, im taking your output, putting it in winmerge, and confirming we arent losing data in the update. when you provide placeholders, my cursory review turns into a meticulous file parsing, taking me from what is 5 seconds per artifact to upwards of 5 minutes, only to realize that the output is actually un-parseable, due to the nature of relativity, as the theory of relativity also applies to code. if you give me a code snippet, and do not give me the code surrounding that snippet, i do not know where that code should go. by providing the complete file, on the other hand, i can put it in a diff, see easily what was altered, and if anything was accidentally omitted or lost, i can be sure that it's retained.

7.  **Update documentation before writing code.** document artifacts are like our project readme files, our source of truth. they are our blueprints. they guide the code we write. when we realize we need to alter our approach or invent new game mechanics, we update the source of truth first, cause english is easy and flexible, then we codify that.

8.  this query is part of a larger software engineering project

9.  After you complete delivery on a code artifact, review it to make sure you did not miss any intermediary files. for instance, if we have a DevelopmentSystem.ts, using the componentData.ts, which is displaying on the ComponentProductionTab.tsx. But then theres also still a DevPanel.tsx file that is in-between that *could*, but shouldnt, get overlooked.

10. If you are deciding where to put a particular piece of code or function, and due to its nature, there are one or more candidate files that it could be placed in, choose the smaller file (in tokens).

11. Begin your response with a course of action and end with a review of your work, surface any self corrections in the summary of changes for the subsequent cycle.

12. do not underestimate how much you can accomplish in a given cycle; you'd only accomplish handicapping yourself. (Eg. you've authored this whole thing with just my guidance. good job, keep it up.)

13. Not as relevant for this project: **Log State Button:** The 'Log State' button in the `DevInfoOverlay` is a dynamic debugging tool. Modify the `triggerDebugLogs` action in `uiStore.ts` to output specific state information relevant to the current bug being investigated. **See A85 (Logging Guide) for usage details.**

14. Not as relevant for this project: **Regression Case Studies:** Use Artifact A106 to document persistent or complex bugs and their resolutions. Add entries *after* a fix is confirmed to codify the RCA and solution, preventing future regressions.

15. Include in your cycle summary, a short list of files you've updated. This makes it easy for my reviews.

16. if you seem to have spare time in a cycle, see if you can spot any particular file with excessive levels of comments or logging that seems extensive and for troubleshooting an error that has since been resolved, see to it to clean those files but preserve their functionalities. im just looking to shave off excess tokens wherever possible in the master_content.txt file.

17. if you see `(No change from C850)` such language, it's data loss. there was supposed to be actual language behind that placeholder, but in one iteration (C850, in this case) you had provided a placeholder, and i 'missed it' and did not capture the initial information. you either need to deliver the placeholder in such a way as i can easily press the left arrow instead of the rigth arrow in winmerge to not accept that part, but to also not have winmerge confuse it with the rest, otherwise i must manually parse the information. when the process is a single keystroke, i can manage it quickly enough. when we remove that ability because you provided me data in a format that has placeholders AND the placeholders do not parse within winmerge such that it removes the benefit winmerge is adding, then we have our problem. when you see this, try to correct it using whatever current relevant context you have.

18. basically, you should not worry about brevity, because when you go too long, your response gets interrupted by the system anyway. its better that the products you do deliver are all complete except for the last one, rather than you delivering all incomplete products, including the last one. does that make sense?

19. remember, do not stop outputting for the reason of preventing a potential artifact interruption mid-output. you actually end up stopping yourself from producting two or three additional files before you actually get interrupted. what i mean is, in the outputs where you do not do this, you produce for 500 seconds, producing 7-9 files, and only the last one is interrupted and unusable. compared to when you stop yourself prematurely, for the reason stated, and you produce for 180 seconds and provide maybe 3-4 files. even with the -1, producing as much as you can still outperforms the alternative.

20. This is a misaligned statement: `// (For full history, see master_content.txt)` because your changes get rolled into master_content.txt. therefore, if you remove the history, then when your updates are rolled in, they will remove the full history. understand? after a while, the history is not relevant and can be rolled out, for a while, it ought to stay. you can see what we're working on + the current cycle and make this determination.

21. Each time we create a new documentation artifact, lets also create the key/value pairs needed for me to add it into our Master Artifact List. they can simply be added into the new artifact itself and ill make the new entry in A0. this will solve for me manually generating a description and tag for each new documentation artifact. also, dont place `/` in the title/name of a documentation artifact. VSCode treats it as a folder separator.
21.1. when creating a new documentation artifact, also just update the master artifacts list itself.

22. **New: Curator Activity Section:** If you need the human curator to perform an action that you cannot (e.g., delete a file, run a specific command), include these instructions in a dedicated `<curator_activity>...</curator_activity>` section in your response.

# Artifact A52.1: DCE - Parser Logic and AI Guidance
# Date Created: C155
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C14 (Make file tag parsing more flexible)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Provides the literal source code for the response parser and explicit instructions to the AI on how to format its output to ensure successful parsing.
- **Tags:** documentation, process, parsing, metainterpretability, source of truth

## 1. Overview & Goal (Metainterpretability)

This document is included in every prompt to provide you with direct insight into how your responses are parsed. By understanding the exact logic used to interpret your output, you can structure your responses to be perfectly machine-readable, ensuring a smooth and reliable workflow.

The goal is to eliminate parsing failures caused by unexpected formatting. Adhering to this guide is a critical part of the interaction schema.

## 2. The Parser's Source Code

The following TypeScript code is the complete and exact logic used by the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel to parse your responses. It looks for specific XML tags to separate the summary, course of action, and file blocks.

```typescript
// src/client/utils/response-parser.ts
import { ParsedResponse, ParsedFile } from '@/common/types/pcpp.types';

const SUMMARY_REGEX = /<summary>([\s\S]*?)<\/summary>/;
const COURSE_OF_ACTION_REGEX = /<course_of_action>([\s\S]*?)<\/course_of_action>/;
const CURATOR_ACTIVITY_REGEX = /<curator_activity>([\s\S]*?)<\/curator_activity>/;
// C14 Update: More flexible closing tag matching
const FILE_TAG_REGEX = /<file path="([^"]+)">([\s\S]*?)(?:<\/file_path>|<\/file>|<\/filepath>|<\/file_artifact>)/g;
const CODE_FENCE_START_REGEX = /^\s*```[a-zA-Z]*\n/;

export function parseResponse(rawText: string): ParsedResponse {
    const fileMap = new Map<string, ParsedFile>();
    let totalTokens = 0;

    let processedText = rawText.replace(/\\</g, '<').replace(/\\>/g, '>').replace(/\\_/g, '_');

    const tagMatches = [...processedText.matchAll(FILE_TAG_REGEX)];

    if (tagMatches.length === 0 && processedText.includes('<file path')) {
        const summary = `**PARSING FAILED:** Could not find valid \`<file path="...">...</file_artifact>\` (or similar) tags. The response may be malformed or incomplete. Displaying raw response below.\n\n---\n\n${processedText}`;
        return { summary, courseOfAction: '', filesUpdated: [], files: [], totalTokens: Math.ceil(processedText.length / 4) };
    }

    for (const match of tagMatches) {
        const path = (match?. ?? '').trim();
        let content = (match?. ?? '');

        if (path) {
            content = content.replace(CODE_FENCE_START_REGEX, '');
            // C14 Update: Add new tags to the removal list
            const patternsToRemove = [`</file_artifact>`, `</file_path>`, `</filepath>`, `</file>`, `</${path}>`, '```', '***'];
            let changed = true;
            while(changed) {
                const originalContent = content;
                for (const pattern of patternsToRemove) {
                    if (content.trim().endsWith(pattern)) {
                        content = content.trim().slice(0, -pattern.length);
                    }
                }
                if (content === originalContent) { changed = false; }
            }
            content = content.trim();
            const tokenCount = Math.ceil(content.length / 4);
            fileMap.set(path, { path, content, tokenCount });
        }
    }

    const finalFiles = Array.from(fileMap.values());
    totalTokens = finalFiles.reduce((sum, file) => sum + file.tokenCount, 0);

    const summaryMatch = processedText.match(SUMMARY_REGEX);
    const courseOfActionMatch = processedText.match(COURSE_OF_ACTION_REGEX);
    const curatorActivityMatch = processedText.match(CURATOR_ACTIVITY_REGEX);

    const summary = (summaryMatch?.[1] ?? 'Could not parse summary.').trim();
    const courseOfAction = (courseOfActionMatch?.[1] ?? 'Could not parse course of action.').trim();
    const curatorActivity = (curatorActivityMatch?.[1] ?? '').trim();
    
    const filesUpdatedList = finalFiles.map(f => f.path);

    if (finalFiles.length === 0 && !summaryMatch && !courseOfActionMatch && !curatorActivityMatch) {
        return { summary: processedText, courseOfAction: '', filesUpdated: [], files: [], totalTokens: Math.ceil(processedText.length / 4) };
    }

    return {
        summary,
        courseOfAction,
        curatorActivity,
        filesUpdated: [...new Set(filesUpdatedList)],
        files: finalFiles,
        totalTokens,
    };
}
```

## 3. Critical Instructions for Formatting Your Response

To guarantee successful parsing, every response **must** follow this structure:

1.  **Summary:** Your high-level analysis and plan must be enclosed in `<summary>...</summary>` tags.
2.  **Course of Action:** Your point-by-point plan must be enclosed in `<course_of_action>...</course_of_action>` tags.
3.  **File Blocks:** Every file you generate must be enclosed in `<file path="..."></file_artifact>` tags (or a similar valid closing tag). The parser uses a global regex (`/g`) to find all occurrences of this pattern. The closing tag can be `</file_artifact>`, `</file_path>`, `</filepath>`, or `</file>`.

### Canonical Example:

```
<summary>
I have analyzed the request. My course of action is to update the main component and its corresponding stylesheet.
</summary>

<course_of_action>
1.  **Update `view.tsx`:** Add a new state variable and a button.
2.  **Update `view.scss`:** Add styling for the new button.
</course_of_action>

<file path="src/client/views/my-view/view.tsx">
// (Canonical Example) Full content of the view.tsx file...
</file_artifact>

<file path="src/client/views/my-view/view.scss">
/* (Canonical Example) Full content of the view.scss file... */
</file_artifact>
```

okay, the scrolling is fixed, however the image vertical size (horizontal bar) adjustment is still not 'fixed' and only changes when the user changes it. still, as i scroll through the pages, the overall size of the resizable box which contains our imagery is changing its size. it should remain the same and only the user should be able to adjust it.

next, i get a 500 error when trying to message ascentia, and the tts is not yet working. oh! where should i place the embedding files?

[Fast Refresh] performing full reload

Fast Refresh will perform a full reload when you edit a file that's imported by modules outside of the React rendering tree.
You might have a file which exports a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a non-React component file.
Consider migrating the non-React component export to a separate file and importing it into both files.

It is also possible the parent component of the component you edited is a class component, which disables Fast Refresh.
Fast Refresh requires at least one parent function component in your React tree. hot-reloader-client.js:348:25

<Previous Cycle 14 Summary of Actions>
This cycle addresses the user's request to more tightly integrate the report viewer with the main website, implement Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality, and begin scaffolding the "Ask @Ascentia" chat feature using the new vLLM backend context.

My course of action is as follows:

1.  **Layout Integration:** I will modify the main layout and the showcase page to ensure the site's header is always visible, providing a clear navigation path back to the homepage from the report viewer. The report viewer itself will be adjusted to fit within this standard page layout rather than being a full-screen modal.

2.  **TTS Implementation:** I will create a new backend API route (`/api/tts/route.ts`) to act as a secure proxy for the TTS server. I will then port the `AudioControls.tsx` component and all related state management from the `aiascentgame` context into the `reportStore`, wiring it up to call our new backend endpoint. This will enable full audio narration of the report content.

3.  **"Ask @Ascentia" Scaffolding:** Leveraging the provided `vcpg` context for vLLM integration, I will create a backend API route (`/api/chat/route.ts`) to proxy requests to the local vLLM. I will also port the `ReportChatPanel.tsx` component and integrate the necessary state management for a fully functional, streaming chat interface.

4.  **Component Refactoring:** The existing placeholder `ReportViewer.tsx` will be replaced with the more feature-complete `ReportViewerModal.tsx` from the `aiascentgame` context, which will be refactored to serve as the main, non-modal component. The `reportStore` will be significantly upgraded by merging the comprehensive logic from the `aiascentgame` version, which already includes state for TTS and chat.

This is a significant feature update that will bring the report viewer to life with audio narration and interactive chat capabilities, while seamlessly integrating it into the main website's user experience.

1.  **Update `src/app/layout.tsx`:** Ensure the `<Header />` and `<Footer />` components are rendered for all pages, providing persistent site navigation.
2.  **Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** Modify the showcase page to render the `ReportViewer` within a standard page layout, adding padding to account for the fixed header.
3.  **Replace `src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** Overwrite the existing placeholder store with the complete, feature-rich version from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`. This version includes all necessary state and actions for TTS, chat, progress tracking, and more. I will adapt its API calls to point to the new backend routes.
4.  **Replace `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`:** Replace the placeholder component with the content of `context/aiascentgame/report/ReportViewerModal.tsx`. I will refactor it to remove modal-specific logic and adapt it to function as the main page component, integrating the new `AudioControls` and `ReportChatPanel`.
5.  **Create `src/components/report-viewer/AudioControls.tsx`:** Copy this component from the `aiascentgame` context to provide the UI for the new TTS feature.
6.  **Create `src/components/report-viewer/ReportChatPanel.tsx`:** Copy this component from the `aiascentgame` context to provide the UI for the "Ask @Ascentia" feature. I will adapt its fetch requests to use the new API route.
7.  **Create `src/app/api/tts/route.ts`:** Create a new Next.js API Route Handler to act as a backend proxy. It will receive text from the client, forward it to the `TTS_SERVER_URL` provided by the user, and stream the resulting audio back.
8.  **Create `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`:** Create another API Route Handler to proxy chat requests to the vLLM server endpoint (`http://192.168.1.85:1234/v1/completions`), based on the `vcpg` context. This will handle prompt construction and stream the LLM's response back to the client.

nice work! okay. here are my observations:

<visual observations>
1. the navbar home, showcase, learn, mission, and github are not center-aligned. see how they are shifted to the right? i drew a red vertical line directly through the middle to help better illustrate how its lop-sided.
2. (orange arrow) as i navigate through the pages, this horizontal resizeable element gets adjusted by itself. in other words, it moves when the user is not moving it. it should be persistent and should only change position when the user changes it. for example, since its moving, i had my mouse over the down arrow to change pages, but as the bar moved, it actually moves the elements below it too (necessarily), and the arrow i was clicking moved out from under my mouse. very frustrating to have to 'chase' a button across a UI...
3. for some reason, my window wants to scroll down on certain events. for instance, when i write a message to Ascentia and press enter, my view scrolls down. this is odd behavior and undesireable. another instance is when i click on the `clear chat` button, it scrolls my screen down to the bottom. things like this shouldnt move unless the user moves it, so scrolling/window resize/adjustments.
</visual observations>

<functional observations>
1. i get an error when i try to view another image on the same page.
2. Ascentia does not respond: `🤖 Ascentia: Error proxying chat request.`
3. the TTS does not play when i click the play button.

<Previous Cycle 13 Summary of Actions>
I will implement the AI Ascent Report Viewer on the `/showcase` page. The current page only displays a "Loading..." message. My plan is to port the necessary components and state management logic from the `aiascentgame` context, adapt them for this project, and integrate them to create a fully functional, interactive report viewer.

This involves several key steps:
1.  **Update Dependencies:** I will add `zustand` for state management and `re-resizable` for adjustable UI panels to the `package.json`.
2.  **Port and Adapt the State Logic:** I will port the `reportStore.ts` from the `aiascentgame` context. This is the core of the viewer. I will update its data-loading functions to fetch the `ai_ascent_report.json` and `imageManifest.json` files from their correct locations within the `public` directory and ensure the image paths are correctly constructed.
3.  **Create the Main Report Viewer Component:** I will refactor the original `ReportViewerModal.tsx` into a new, non-modal component named `ReportViewer.tsx`. This will serve as the main container for all the report elements.
4.  **Port UI Components:** I will port all the child components (`PageNavigator`, `ImageNavigator`, `ReportTreeNav`, etc.) and update their import paths. As requested, I will remove the voting functionality from `ImageNavigator`. I will also provide a simplified version of the `ReportChatPanel` for this cycle, focusing on the core report viewing experience first.
5.  **Integrate into Showcase Page:** Finally, I will replace the current placeholder content on the `/showcase` page with the new, fully functional `ReportViewer` component.

1.  **`package.json`:** Add `zustand` and `re-resizable` as new dependencies to support the ported components.
2.  **`src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** Replace the placeholder file with the full implementation from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`. I will modify the `loadReportData` function to:
    *   Fetch data from `/data/ai_ascent_report.json` and `/data/imageManifest.json`.
    *   Correctly construct image URLs by using a hardcoded base path of `/assets/images/report/` to match the project's asset structure, ignoring the `basePath` from the manifest.
3.  **`src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx` (New File):** Create this main component by adapting the code from `context/aiascentgame/report/ReportViewerModal.tsx`. I will strip out all modal-specific logic (overlays, close functions tied to a global UI store) and convert it into a self-contained page component that fetches its own data on mount.
4.  **`src/components/report-viewer/*.tsx` (Update All):** Replace all placeholder component files with their full implementations from the `context/aiascentgame/report/` directory. I will then meticulously update all import paths within these files to point to the new store and component locations.
5.  **`src/components/report-viewer/ImageNavigator.tsx` (Modification):** As part of the porting process, I will remove the voting system functionality and its related dependencies (`useSession`, `castVote`, etc.) from this component as per the project requirements.
6.  **`src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** Update the showcase page to be a client component and render the new `<ReportViewer />`, replacing the "Loading..." placeholder.

nailed it. okay i need a way to return from the showcase page back to the homepage, perhaps the navbar should be retained? work to more intimiately integrate the two please. the progress can simply represent each page. lets get the TTS. we already have the audio api running and available. however im developing on my laptop and the kokoro is on the pc in my closet. should be able to access it via its IP address though. `TTS_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.85:8880/v1/audio/speech` and same for the vLLM.

so thats actually been changed since ive made the aiascent, which is im no longer hosting the AI via LMStudio, instead im hosting it via vLLM. for that, i added some context from our virtual cyber proving ground project, thats when we made the transition. see `vcpg`

<Previous Cycle 12 Summary of Actions>
I have analyzed the extensive feedback and new feature requests. My plan is to address the immediate visual bugs, update all relevant documentation to reflect the new scope, and then begin scaffolding and implementing the major new features, including the Mission page and the porting of the AI Ascent Report Viewer.

This is a comprehensive update that will touch on styling, component implementation, and project planning.


### Course of Action:

1.  **Documentation First:**
    *   Create a new planning artifact, `A20. aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan`, to outline the strategy for porting the report viewer from the `aiascentgame` context. This will define the new file structure (`src/components/report-viewer/`, `src/stores/reportStore.ts`) and asset locations (`public/data/`, `public/assets/images/report/`).
    *   Update the `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md` to include the new `A20` artifact.
    *   Update the `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to reflect the new tasks for this cycle, including fixing the hero section GIF, implementing the light mode theme, creating the Mission page, and porting the report viewer.
    *   Update the `A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md` to incorporate these new, more granular tasks.

2.  **Fix Homepage Visuals:**
    *   **Hero Section GIF:** In `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`, I will remove the white background from the `ContainerScroll` component's card, allowing the dark theme to show through. I will also expand the `pcp.gif` to fill more of the container, making its details more visible as requested.
    *   **Light Mode Theme:** I will implement a full light mode theme by adding new CSS variables to `src/app/globals.css`. This will involve defining a light color palette for backgrounds, text, borders, and accents. I will then apply these variables using Tailwind's `light:` variants across all relevant components (`FeaturesSection.tsx`, `WorkflowSection.tsx`, `lamp.tsx`, etc.) to fix issues with readability, contrast, and clashing colors. The particle colors in the `lamp.tsx` component will be inverted for light mode.

3.  **Implement New Pages:**
    *   **Mission Page:** Create the new page at `src/app/mission/page.tsx`. I will populate this page with content based on the blueprint in `A19` and the user's narrative about "cognitive apprenticeship," the "fissured workplace," and becoming "solarpunk prime."
    *   **Learn & Showcase Pages:** Create placeholder pages for `/learn` and update `/showcase` to resolve the 404 errors and prepare them for the integration of the report viewer component.

4.  **Scaffold the Report Viewer:**
    *   Create the new directory `src/components/report-viewer/` and copy the component files from the `context/aiascentgame/report/` directory into it.
    *   Create the new Zustand store at `src/stores/reportStore.ts` using the provided context file.
    *   I will then begin the process of adapting the code, starting with the main `ReportViewer` component, to function within the `aiascent.dev` project.

5.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   Add `react-icons` to the `package.json` as it is a required dependency for the ported report viewer components.

A curator activity section is included with instructions for managing new dependencies and placing the necessary data and image assets for the report viewer.

1.  **Create `A20. aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan.md`:** A new artifact to document the plan for porting the report viewer components and assets.
2.  **Update `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md`:** Add the new `A20` artifact to the master list.
3.  **Update `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`:** Add new tasks for fixing visuals (T-7, T-8), implementing the Mission page (T-9), porting the report viewer (T-10), and creating the Learn page shell (T-11).
4.  **Update `A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md`:** Revise the roadmap to include the new feature implementations and fixes.
5.  **Update `package.json`:** Add `react-icons` as a dependency.
6.  **Update `src/app/globals.css`:** Define a complete set of CSS variables for a new light theme to address all reported visual issues with colors and readability.
7.  **Update `tailwind.config.ts`:** Add light-mode variants for particle colors in the `lamp` component.
8.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Remove the white background behind the `pcp.gif` and adjust its sizing to be larger and more detailed.
9.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** Add `light:` variants for borders to improve appearance in light mode.
10. **Update `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** Add `light:` variants for background and text colors to ensure visibility.
11. **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** Add `light:` variants to invert the lamp effect and change particle colors for better visibility on a light background.
12. **Create `src/app/mission/page.tsx`:** Create the new Mission page with content derived from `A19` and the user's prompt.
13. **Create `src/app/learn/page.tsx`:** Create a placeholder page to resolve the 404.
14. **Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** Replace the existing content with a placeholder, preparing it for the new report viewer component.
15. **Create `src/components/report-viewer/` directory:** Copy all report viewer component files from `context/aiascentgame/report/` into this new directory.
16. **Create `src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** Copy the `reportStore.ts` content from the context into this new file to manage the state for the report viewer.

<Previous Cycle 11 Summary of Actions>
I have analyzed the user's feedback from Cycle 10. My course of action is to address the final visual polish issues in the Mission section and resolve the legacy `next/image` warnings.

1.  **Expand Lamp Effect:** I will increase the height of the conic gradient elements within `lamp.tsx` to ensure the light effect extends to the bottom of the section, fully encompassing the particle effect as requested.
2.  **Reduce Lamp Luminosity:** To counteract the increased "light pollution" from the expanded effect, I will dim the lamp by adjusting the colors and opacity of its constituent layers, making the effect more subtle.
3.  **Stylize Mission Title:** I will update the `MissionSection.tsx` title, "THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM," to use the same text gradient style as other section headers for visual consistency.
4.  **Fix Image Prop Warnings:** I will refactor the `<Image>` components in `HeroSection.tsx` and `FeaturesSection.tsx` to use the modern Next.js props, replacing the deprecated `layout` and `objectFit` attributes to eliminate the warnings during development.

This will finalize the visual design of the homepage and clean up the developer console notifications.

1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**
    *   **Expand Lamp Coverage:** I will increase the height of the two main `motion.div` elements responsible for the conic gradient from `h-96` to `h-[60rem]`. This will stretch the light cone vertically to cover the entire particle effect area, resolving the gap at the bottom.
    *   **Reduce Luminosity:** To dim the overall effect, I will change the gradient color from `from-neutral-500` to a darker `from-neutral-700`. I will also reduce the main light orb's intensity by changing its classes from `bg-neutral-500 opacity-50` to `bg-neutral-600 opacity-40`.

2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**
    *   **Apply Title Gradient:** I will modify the `className` of the `h2` title. I will replace the existing gradient (`bg-gradient-to-br from-neutral-300 to-neutral-500`) with the site-wide standard (`bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600`) and add the `font-bold` class to match other section titles.

3.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**
    *   **Update Image Component:** I will refactor the `<Image>` component used for `pcp.gif`. I will remove the legacy `layout="fill"` and `objectFit="cover"` props. I will replace them with the boolean `fill` prop and add the `object-cover` utility class to the `className` string.

4.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**
    *   **Update Image Component:** I will perform the same refactor on the `<Image>` component within the `.map()` loop. I will replace `layout="fill"` and `objectFit="cover"` with the `fill` prop and the `object-cover` class.

fantastic work! okay the herosection still has a white border around the pcp.gif, in addition theres still 'room to grow', in the sense that we could still expand that gif more such that more of the details become visible. the red arrows are showing what i mean when i say how it could be expanded, and the yellow arrows are showing the white border.

next, i believe we can port over the report viewer into the showcase, and then also to create the mission section. essentially, i want to be solarpunk prime. i want to be the OG vibe coder. i want to share what i have discovered to the rest of the country. i want america to continue to be a stabilizing force in to this new future. the fissured workplace is the antithesis of this dream. it is a de-facto pro-china stance. this is the overall story, please do not take my language verbatim, im speaking tersely here and now between us to get the big picture across. i want to create a community around the DCE. i will vibe code on stream using the DCE in order to teach others. the cognitive apprenticeship model for the report.

lets continue, lets update our documentation to align our roadmap/checklists with our current progress, see what more is left to do, such as the 404 on the mission page, the learn section is also a 404, and the showcase.

for the showcase, lets replicate the entire aiascent report. its already written. we can have it read by Ascentia as well. we will retain everything except the voting system.

ive pulled out the report-related code files from aiascent and placed them in a `report` folder in the `context` directory. ill re-use the same report index and embedding that i already have just let me know where to put it, as well as where to copy/paste the images to, etc. that kind of planning artifact. review the situation then plan to get us from where we are at to where we need to be.


then, on the homepage, we will want to replicate the exact same report viewer into the interactive visualization, and in there instead of the big ai ascent report, we will place our smaller whitepaper. we will do that after, as we will have to convert the whitepaper into a report.json and corresponding imagemanifest with appropriate images, when currently it is only a markdown file. compared to the ai ascent report which is already completed. just keep this in mind when planning, in that we plan to use the report viewer in more than one 'place' and will have more than one 'report' to view.

for the learn section, this is where we will make new reports over time. this is where i can create curriculum on how to use the DCE, how to work with AI, etc. here we will need to add to the report viewer such that we can select from multiple reports, that way there can be a curriculum or lesson plan that we can 'put before' a 'visitor/prospective student'.


finally, i just realized that the light mode color combinations have not been reviewed/considered. its very bad. ill provide three screenshots and critique the issues so we can resolve them.

in screenshot 1, you can see the color scheme is not conducive to 'light mode', which is currently selected.
in screenshot 2, you can see that the font choice is hard to read against the light background. additionally, the border around the images is not conducive to a light theme.
in screenshot 3, same font choice issue against the light background, but also the text within the boxes is not visible, only the blue numbers in the boxes are. finally, the color selection of the particles is not conducive to light mode. it clashes with the light background above and below it.

<Previous Cycle 10 Summary of Actions>
I have analyzed the visual feedback from Cycle 9. The two outstanding issues are that the title in the "Rise of Cognitive Capitalism" section is still partially obscured, and the lamp's lighting effect does not extend far enough vertically to match the area of the particle effect.

My course of action is to make targeted adjustments within the `lamp.tsx` component to correct both of these issues simultaneously. I will lower the text content to bring the title fully into view and expand the vertical dimensions of the lamp's lighting elements to ensure they fill the entire particle background as requested.

1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**
    *   To resolve the partially cut-off title, I will adjust the vertical translation of the content container. I will change the `translate-y-40` class to `translate-y-20`, which will shift the title, paragraph, and button downwards, making them fully visible.
    *   To expand the lamp effect vertically to match the sparkles' area, I will modify the elements that create the light cone. I will increase the height of the two `motion.div`s responsible for the conic gradients from `h-56` to `h-96`. I will also increase the vertical scaling of the entire lighting effect container from `scale-y-125` to `scale-y-150`. This combination will stretch the light effect downwards to fill the entire height of the component, matching the particle effect as desired.

okay! its almost perfect! theres still just a tiny sliver of the sparkles/particles that are not encompassed by the lamp effect. ive provided an image without edits, as well as an image with three different colored/sized brackets. the green one indicates the issue, the space that the lamp effect is not affecting. the yellow shows what the lamp is affecting, relative to the particle effect. the red bracket indicates the desired coverage of the lamp effect.

next, by expanding this lamp effect, the overall light pollution has increased. is it possible to reduce the light spread of the lamp as well? like decrease luminosity some? finally, im not sure if the text the rise of cognitive capitalism is stylized like the text above it. the power of iteration is stylized its got a color fade to it. can we have that applied to the title in the mission section?

finally, a few notifications appear when running npm run dev (see ephemeral)

<Previous Cycle 9 Summary of Actions>
I have analyzed the user's feedback regarding the visual issues in the bottom "Mission" section of the website. My course of action is to make targeted adjustments to the `lamp.tsx` component to resolve the cut-off title, the rectangular lighting artifacts, and the gap at the bottom of the sparkles effect. I will also adjust the `MissionSection.tsx` to ensure it integrates seamlessly with these changes.

1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**
    *   **Fix Header Cut Off (Purple):** I will adjust the vertical positioning of the content within the `LampContainer`. The `div` containing the `children` has a negative `translate-y` value that is too aggressive. I will reduce this value (e.g., from `-translate-y-60` to `-translate-y-40`) to move the content down, providing more space at the top and preventing the title from being clipped.
    *   **Fix Rectangular Artifact (Yellow):** To eliminate the hard edges of the light cone effect, I will significantly increase the width of the `motion.div` elements that create the conic gradients. By changing their width from `w-[50rem]` to a much larger `w-[80rem]`, the light will appear to spread more naturally across the entire section, covering the area where the sparkles are visible.
    *   **Fix Bottom Sliver (Red):** The gap at the bottom is caused by padding on the main `LampContainer`. I will remove the `pb-20` (bottom padding) from the container and ensure the absolutely positioned `SparklesCore` component fills the entire height of its parent, extending the effect to the very bottom edge.

2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**
    *   To compensate for the padding removal in the `LampContainer`, I will adjust the negative bottom margin on the `<section>` element. This will ensure there is no large, unwanted gap or overlap between the mission section and the footer, maintaining a clean layout.

okay, almost fixed. the lamp now encompasses the same space horizontally as the sparkles, now we just need to expand it downward to encompass all the same space as the sparkles in the vertical direction as well, and the title is still covered a bit.

the yellow arrows are pointing to the title. we can now see the bottom slice of the title text, whereas previously we could not see the title what so ever. moving it down slightly more will be enough to make it completely visible. note, ill provide the markedup image of the previous cycle so you can see the progression. the image with the purple arrow is the image from the previous cycle, the purple arrow is pointing to the covered title.

the red arrows are pointing to where the lamp stops expanding down vertically. the red bracket also indicates the lamp area. the green bracket is the ideal size of the lamp, it should match the area of the sparkles.

I have analyzed the user's feedback regarding the visual issues at the bottom of the homepage. My course of action is to correct the cut-off title, remove visual artifacts in the particle effect, reduce the excessive empty space, and properly align the footer content to the corners. I will achieve this by making targeted adjustments to the Mission section, the Lamp component, and the site's Footer.

1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**
    *   To fix the cut-off title, I will reduce the upward translation of the content container from `-translate-y-80` to a smaller value, bringing the title fully into view.
    *   To eliminate the rectangular visual artifacts, I will modify the properties of the blur and gradient overlay divs. Specifically, I will increase the size and blur intensity of the main circular blur effect to ensure its edges are soft and blend seamlessly with the particle background.
    *   To reduce the large empty space above the footer, I will decrease the bottom padding of the `LampContainer` itself.

2.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**
    *   I will remove the large negative bottom margin (`-mb-40`). This was a temporary fix to pull the footer up, but with the `LampContainer` size being adjusted, this is no longer necessary and will allow for more precise control over the spacing.

3.  **Update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:**
    *   To align the footer text to the corners, I will refactor the component's layout. I will change the main container to use Flexbox with `justify-between`, pushing the "Built using..." text to the left and the copyright notice to the right.
    *   I will also adjust the padding and remove unnecessary container `divs` to ensure the text sits cleanly in the bottom corners of the viewport.

nice, we're closer to a clean look. here are the outstanding issues.

1. (purple) title/header is still getting cut off at the top
2. (yellow) theres this rectangle that i believe is coming from the lamp. i think we need this lamp effect to expand more and encompass the same space as the particles/sparkles.
3. (red) there is a tiny sliver of the blue background at the bottom of the sparkles/particles. can the sparkles/particles just go to the very bottom and not have that sliver?

same as last time, i provided you an unmarked image and then a marked up image, this time color coded with the issue/description/observation.
</Cycle Context>
<Previous Cycle 7 Summary of Actions>
I have analyzed the user's feedback from the screenshots and will implement the requested visual improvements. My course of action is to make the `pcp.gif` and feature images larger and more prominent, and to fix the layout and visual artifacts in the "More Than Code" section with the sparkles effect.

1.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Modify the `ContainerScroll`'s child `div` to remove the light background, allowing the dark theme to show through. I will also adjust the styling to make the `pcp.gif` significantly larger, filling more of the available screen space as requested, to make its details more visible.

2.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will refactor this section's layout to give the feature images much more prominence. Instead of three small cards side-by-side, I will change the layout to a more focused presentation where each feature's image is displayed in a larger format, making the details clear and impactful. I will stack them vertically with more emphasis on the visual component.

3.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To address the spacing issues, I will remove the `min-h-[800px]` from the `LampContainer` and adjust the padding. This will eliminate the large empty areas above and below the content.

4.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**
    *   To fix the rectangular artifact behind the text, I will adjust the `z-index` of the text container to ensure it is rendered on top of all the lamp's lighting effect layers.
    *   To address the request to move the "lamp line" up, I will adjust the `translate-y` property of the corresponding `motion.div`.
    *   To make the sparkles fill the entire background, I will modify the `SparklesCore` container to be `absolute` and fill the entire `LampContainer`.

5.  **`src/app/page.tsx`:** I will adjust the negative margins and overall structure to accommodate the refactored `FeaturesSection` and the resized `MissionSection`, ensuring a clean flow between components.

okay now lets just focus on the bottom/mission section. it really needs work. theres a lot of rectangular artifacts, and the footer is not in the corner, and the title/heading is being cut-off once again. finally, there is a lot of unnecessary space in between the read our mission button and the footer.

im providing two screenshots. one is the raw image, and the other one ive marked up these issues with red lines. the red rectangle at the top is indicating the cut-off title/header, the two hollow arrows are pointing to the weird rectangle effects. they seem to be from the lamp. perhaps the lamp needs to expand too like the sparkles needed to expand? the bracket is indicating the random empty space that we want to reduce, and the two hand-drawn arrows are indiating how the footer text is too far from the corners.
</Cycle Context>
<Previous Cycle 6 Summary of Actions>
I have analyzed the feedback from Cycle 5 and will implement the requested visual and layout adjustments to the homepage. My course of action is to increase spacing in the hero section, enlarge the feature images, and expand and refine the particle effect in the mission section.

1.  **Adjust Hero Section Spacing:** I will modify `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` to add more vertical space between the main text/buttons and the animated `ContainerScroll` component, preventing the buttons from being obscured. I will also remove the temporary `<br>` tags from the title for a cleaner, CSS-based solution.
2.  **Enlarge Feature Images:** I will update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx` to make the three feature images more prominent. This involves increasing the size of the image containers and the `Image` components themselves, as well as widening the parent cards to accommodate the new dimensions.
3.  **Refine Mission Section Particles:**
    *   I will edit `src/components/global/lamp.tsx` to expand the area where the particles are rendered by increasing the minimum height of the `LampContainer`.
    *   To address the hard-to-read text in `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`, I will increase the text's contrast by making it a lighter color.
    *   To fix the horizontal black line in the particle area, I will remove a specific overlay `div` within `lamp.tsx` that appears to be creating an unnatural hard edge, allowing the particle effect to blend more smoothly with the background.
    *   I will also soften the harsh cyan light color in `lamp.tsx` to a more neutral tone to further improve text readability and align with the site's sophisticated aesthetic.

<Cycle Context>
nice work! okay, now it looks good up to the pcp.gif. the gif has been placed inside a white area. the white color is detracting from the overall look. instead, can we expand the image to not only be larger, but we want to show it bigger so more of the details become visible. when the image is too small, none of the text can be read. there is a lot of empty space to allow us to expand the image much larger. i drew a red line sort of over the white area im referring to, and the red arrows are indicating that extra space that the gif could be expanded to show more detail

the same goes for the next three images. they're still coming out too small, making the overall image less appealing as the beauty is in the details of the image. can this be reconstructed to make the images larger/more pronounced? perhaps a click feature which animates a new view to display just that image and a text block to go with it?

the sparkles section is almost perfect. theres an odd space above the sparkles (1), a large empty space below the sparkles (3), still this weird rectangle artifact is appearing behind and to the left of the title. the way the lamp interacts with it makes it visible. can you see that? most noticable in the bottom right corner of the red rectangle (2). for (1), if you could have the sparkles in that area as well, it would no lonegr appear separated. additinally if the lamp line could be moved to the top of the black area i think that would look better visually. for 3, i believe if you just remove that empty space and have our footer follow the bottom of the sparkles, that would be fine. what if also the sparkles expanded into the footer?
</Cycle Context>
<Previous Cycle 5 Summary of Actions>
I have analyzed the feedback from the screenshots and the missing dependency information. My course of action is to address the layout issues, update the assets as requested, and fix the missing `tsparticles` dependencies to resolve the visual bugs and improve the overall polish of the homepage.

1.  **Update `package.json`:** Add the missing `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/engine`, and `@tsparticles/slim` dependencies required for the sparkles effect.
2.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** Add top padding to the main container to offset the fixed header and prevent it from overlapping the hero section title.
3.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**
    *   Modify the `ContainerScroll` to display a single, prominent visual (`pcp.gif`) instead of a side-by-side grid to fix the "split image" issue.
    *   Adjust the section's height and the `ContainerScroll`'s top margin to reduce the large blank space below the hero section.
4.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**
    *   Add padding to the section's title to prevent the text from being cut off.
    *   Update the `features` array to use the newly provided `.png` icons instead of the old `.svg` placeholders, and remove the `invert` class that was specific to the SVGs.
5.  **Update `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** Enhance the styling of the static workflow steps to appear more polished and less like a basic placeholder, creating a more visually appealing layout.
6.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** Adjust the z-index values within the `LampContainer` to ensure the `SparklesCore` component renders behind the main text content, fixing the layering issue.

nice work! okay. i added a few <br>'s to push the top title down. the initial hero card covers the two buttons slightly when its in its up position. can it be spaced out a bit?

next our three images are appearing nicely, however they are way too small. they need to be much more prominent, like half of the size of the screen.

finally, we got our particles! can you expand it out now to encompass that entire bottom section? also the text is slightly hard to read, i think the lamp.tsx is the cyan color that needs shaping? Additionally, there's a noticeable horizontal black line in the particle area that shouldn't be there. is it possible to see the cause of that?

<Previous Cycle 4 Summary of Actions>
This cycle focuses on executing the Home Page implementation (T-3 in A4) and addressing the user's requests regarding asset generation prompts and incorporating the new `pcp.gif`.

First, I updated the Home Page Design (A16) to incorporate the `pcp.gif` alongside the existing screenshot in the Hero section, utilizing the dynamic `ContainerScroll` component for presentation.

Next, I created the requested image generation prompt artifacts (A15.1 through A15.7). A15.1 defines the master system prompt, establishing the aesthetic guidelines for all generated images, drawing inspiration from the `aiascentgame` context (A179) but tailored to the professional aesthetic of `aiascent.dev`. The subsequent artifacts provide specific prompts for the logo, favicon, feature icons, and the OG image. I also updated the Master Artifact List (A0) to include these new documents.

For the implementation (T-3), I began by importing the necessary dynamic UI components from the `automationsaas` context (`ContainerScroll`, `LampComponent`, `SparklesCore`, `3d-card`, `InfiniteMovingCards`) into `src/components/global`. I then updated `tailwind.config.ts` to include the required animations and keyframes for these components.

I implemented the core structure of the home page by creating the section components (`HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowSection`, `MissionSection`) in `src/components/home` and integrating them into `src/app/page.tsx`. The `HeroSection` now uses the `ContainerScroll` component to display the DCE screenshot and the new GIF (assuming it's placed at `public/assets/images/pcp.gif`). The `FeaturesSection` uses the placeholder icons, and the `MissionSection` utilizes the dramatic `LampComponent`.

Finally, I refined the `Header` and `Footer` components to align with the dark, sophisticated aesthetic defined in A16, ensuring a cohesive look across the site. The Universal Task Checklist (A4) has been updated to reflect the completion of these tasks.

nice! okay i accepted the longest response and rolled it in. i did see that we got some libraries we need to add to package.json. see ephemeral.

next, i will provide you with a series of screenshots which shows the site currently. each one ill describe my observations so we can correct.

<screenshot 1>
this is the top of the site. first, the banner is covering the text behind it. the text behind will need to consider the banners existence in terms of spacing.

next, the center image is being split and is displaying two images, one on each side. it should instead be the single image, or perhaps also have an option to switch between multiple images. or, the gif could be in its own section below. currently, neither are visible in a meaningful way.
</screenshot 1>

<screenshot 2>
below the main image, there is a large blank space.
the bottom of the g's in `Fighting` are being cut off slightly. can they get a bit more padding below?
next, for the three tiles, the `precision context curation`, `parallel co-pilot` and `iterative knowledge` tiles, ive created png files rather than svg files. can you work with those instead?
</screenshot 2>

<screenshot 3>
okay so for this screenshot, perhaps the steps of the workflow can become more interactive?

the sparkles i think are supposed to be behind the more than code portion, but i think once we get the tsparticles fixed that will appear more polished.

The project initialization (Cycles 0 and 1) is complete and the application builds successfully. Cycle 2 focused on comprehensive planning, asset management, and defining the creative direction for the website, adhering strictly to the "Documentation First" principle before proceeding with implementation.

I have created **A15 (Asset Wishlist)**, which details the visual assets required for the initial launch and defines the `public/assets` directory structure. I generated placeholder files within this structure (`public/assets/logo.svg`, `public/assets/images/dce-hero-screenshot.png`, etc.) so the curator can easily place the actual assets later.

Next, I developed detailed blueprints for the core pages of the website, incorporating the requested creative direction and strategic goals:

  - **A16 (Home Page Design):** Focuses on a compelling hero section, clear value proposition, and the "Citizen Architect" narrative. It adopts a sophisticated, modern aesthetic and suggests incorporating dynamic UI elements inspired by the provided `automationsaas` context.
  - **A17 (Showcase Page Design):** Details the layout and user experience for the Interactive Whitepaper, emphasizing immersion and the meta-narrative of how the DCE was used to build it.
  - **A18 (Learn Page Design):** A plan for the educational hub, focusing on tutorials and the methodology of AI-assisted development.
  - **A19 (Mission Page Design):** Outlines the page dedicated to the strategic vision, the importance of Cognitive Capitalism, and the broader purpose of the DCE project as a counter-strategy to centralized AI control.

Finally, I updated **A0 (Master Artifact List)** to include these new documents and revised **A4 (Universal Task Checklist)** to reflect the completion of this planning phase and outline the implementation tasks for Cycle 3.

This is Cycle 1, dedicated to initializing the `aiascent.dev` project scaffolding as outlined in the Technical Scaffolding Plan (A3) and Task T-1 of the Universal Task Checklist (A4). The objective is to establish a robust, modern foundation using Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, incorporating the structure for the shadcn/ui component library from the outset.

I have generated the complete foundational setup by creating all necessary configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, etc.), utility files (`src/lib/utils.ts`), and providers (`ThemeProvider`). I utilized configuration patterns observed in the `automationsaas` context (M7) as a reference for best practices in this technology stack.

The core application structure is established, including the root layout, global styles, and the initial landing page. Placeholder components for the Header and Footer have been created, integrating a functional theme toggle (ModeToggle).

Furthermore, the scaffolding for the Interactive Showcase feature has been created according to A3. This includes the data placeholder (`src/data/whitepaperContent.json`), the showcase page (`src/app/showcase/page.tsx`), and the interactive component (`src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`). The data loading strategy is implemented correctly: the JSON is imported in the server component (`showcase/page.tsx`) and passed as a prop to the client component (`InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`).

Finally, I updated the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to mark T-1 as complete and provided instructions for the curator to initialize the project.

okay i selected the most complete response, and was able to build the project. lets continue!

1. please create an artifact which contains an asset wishlist. for instance, our automationsaas has some image assets. lmk what you need. for instance, i just took a screenshot of the dce 'in action', so for example, the FTV and the PCPP panes open mid-project. that will be replacing the main homepage image that was used in the automation saas showcasing that interface. if you can then create placeholder files that will have the effect of creating out any potential directories you need, such as a `public` directory, that i can then place said assets in to once they're created.

2. please plan out this site. create an artifact for each page of our site, and have that artifact be our blueprint for what the page will contain. think plan do, then ill review, then we'll act.

3. when performing step 2, imagine this is your canvas as well. feel free to express some interesting UI elements that are extra but easy. also recall the ultimate goal is to create 'sleeper citizen agent/architects' to combat chinas AI domination policy. if we have an army of cognitive capitalists, we can rival any challenge china throws at us.

<Previous Cycle 1 Summary of Actions>
As the senior project architect for `aiascent.dev`, I have analyzed the project scope (M4) and the provided templates (Static Context) to generate a comprehensive starter set of planning and documentation artifacts. This initializes the project (Cycle 0) with a strong foundation based on the "Documentation First" principle.

I have generated the mandatory guides: A7 (Development and Testing) and A14 (GitHub Setup), ensuring the curator can immediately set up the environment and version control following best practices for the DCE workflow.

Additionally, I created a robust set of core planning documents:

  - A1: Project Vision and Goals
  - A2: Phase 1 Requirements & Design
  - A3: Technical Scaffolding Plan (based on Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS)
  - A11: Implementation Roadmap
  - A4: Universal Task Checklist (to organize the work for Cycle 1)

Finally, I generated the Master Artifact List (A0) to catalog all these documents. No code files were generated, adhering to the Cycle 0 constraints.

The project is now well-documented and ready for the initial scaffolding phase in the next cycle.

# Artifact T14: [Project Name] - GitHub Repository Setup Guide Template
# Date Created: C152
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C160 (Add Sample Development Workflow section)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a guide on setting up a new project with Git and GitHub, including a sample workflow.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, git, github, version control, workflow

## 1. Overview

This guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines a sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).

## 2. Prerequisites

*   You have `git` installed on your machine.
*   You have a GitHub account.

## 3. Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **"New repository"**.
3.  **Repository name:** Enter a name for your project (e.g., `my-new-project`).
4.  **Description:** (Optional) Provide a brief description of your project.
5.  Choose **"Private"** or **"Public"**.
6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files, and this will prevent conflicts.
7.  Click **"Create repository"**.

GitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions. We will use the section titled **"...or push an existing repository from the command line"**.

### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project

Open a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.

1.  **Initialize the repository:**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add all existing files:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Create the first commit:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```

### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub

1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
    ```

2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

After these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files.

## 4. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git

Git is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work, without losing your place.

### Step 1: Start with a Clean State
Before starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean. You can check this with `git status`. All your previous changes should be committed.

### Step 2: Generate a Prompt and Get Responses
Use the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Use this prompt to get multiple responses (e.g., 4 to 8) from your preferred AI model.

### Step 3: Paste and Parse
Paste the responses into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and click "Parse All".

### Step 4: Accept and Test
1.  Review the responses and find one that looks promising.
2.  Select that response and use the **"Accept Selected Files"** button to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.
3.  Now, compile and test the application. Does it work? Does it have errors?

### Step 5: The "Restore" Loop
This is where Git becomes a powerful part of the workflow.

*   **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs, don't work as expected):**
    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.
    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`
    3.  This command instantly discards all uncommitted changes in your workspace, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.
    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can go back to the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, select a *different* AI response, and click "Accept Selected Files" again to test the next proposed solution.

*   **If the changes are good:**
    1.  Open the Source Control panel in VS Code.
    2.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).
    3.  Write a commit message (e.g., "Feat: Implement user login via AI suggestion C15").
    4.  Commit the changes.
    5.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle from a new, clean state.

This iterative loop of `accept -> test -> restore` allows you to rapidly audition multiple AI-generated solutions without fear of corrupting your codebase.

.
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components (e.g., Button, Modal)
│   │
│   ├── features/         # Feature-specific modules
│   │   └── [feature-one]/
│   │       ├── index.ts
│   │       └── components/
│   │
│   ├── services/         # Core backend or client-side services (e.g., api.service.ts)
│   │
│   ├── types/            # Shared TypeScript type definitions
│   │
│   └── main.ts           # Main application entry point

# Artifact T6: Template - Initial Scaffolding Deployment Script (DEPRECATED)
# Date Created: C139
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** (Deprecated) A generic template for a scaffolding deployment script. This is obsolete.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup, deprecated

## 1. Overview

This artifact contains a simple Node.js script (`deploy_scaffold.js`). Its purpose is to automate the creation of the initial project structure for **[Your Project Name]**, as outlined in `T5. Template - Target File Structure`.

**Note:** This approach is now considered obsolete. The preferred method is to have the AI generate the necessary files directly in its response.

## 2. How to Use

1.  Save the code below as `deploy_scaffold.js` in your project's root directory.
2.  Open a terminal in that directory.
3.  Run the script using Node.js: `node deploy_scaffold.js`

## 3. Script: `deploy_scaffold.js`

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;
const path = require('path');

const filesToCreate = [
    { path: 'package.json', content: '{ "name": "my-new-project", "version": "0.0.1" }' },
    { path: 'tsconfig.json', content: '{ "compilerOptions": { "strict": true } }' },
    { path: '.gitignore', content: 'node_modules\ndist' },
    { path: 'src/main.ts', content: '// Main application entry point' },

    { path: 'src/services/placeholder.ts', content: '// Core services' },
    { path: 'src/types/index.ts', content: '// Shared types' },
];

async function deployScaffold() {
    console.log('Deploying project scaffold...');
    const rootDir = process.cwd();

    for (const file of filesToCreate) {
        const fullPath = path.join(rootDir, file.path);
        const dir = path.dirname(fullPath);

        try {
            await fs.mkdir(dir, { recursive: true });
            await fs.writeFile(fullPath, file.content, 'utf-8');
            console.log(`✅ Created: ${file.path}`);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`❌ Failed to create ${file.path}: ${error.message}`);

### Case Study 001: [Name of the Bug]

-   **Artifacts Affected:** [List of files, e.g., `src/components/MyComponent.tsx`, `src/services/api.service.ts`]
-   **Cycles Observed:** [e.g., C10, C15]
-   **Symptom:** [Describe what the user sees. e.g., "When a user clicks the 'Save' button, the application crashes silently."]
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** [Describe the underlying technical reason for the bug. e.g., "The API service was not correctly handling a null response from the server. A race condition occurred where the UI component would unmount before the API promise resolved, leading to a state update on an unmounted component."]
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  [Describe the specific code change, e.g., "The API service was updated to always return a default object instead of null."]
    2.  [Describe the pattern or best practice to follow, e.g., "All API calls made within a React component's `useEffect` hook must include a cleanup function to cancel the request or ignore the result if the component unmounts."]

# Artifact T9: Template - Logging and Debugging Guide
# Date Created: C141

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a logging and debugging guide.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup

## 1. Purpose

This document provides instructions on how to access and use the logging features built into the project. Effective logging is crucial for diagnosing performance issues, tracking down bugs, and understanding the application's behavior during development.

## 2. Log Locations

### Location 1: The Browser Developer Console

This is where you find logs from the **frontend**.

-   **What you'll see here:** `console.log()` statements from React components and client-side scripts.
-   **Where to find it:** Open your browser, right-click anywhere on the page, select "Inspect", and navigate to the "Console" tab.

### Location 2: The Server Terminal

This is where you find logs from the **backend** (the Node.js process).

-   **What you'll see here:** `console.log()` statements from your server-side code, API handlers, and services.
-   **Where to find it:** The terminal window where you started the server (e.g., via `npm start`).

## 3. Tactical Debugging with Logs

When a feature is not working as expected, the most effective debugging technique is to add **tactical logs** at every step of the data's journey to pinpoint where the process is failing.

### Example Data Flow for Debugging:

1.  **Frontend Component (`MyComponent.tsx`):** Log the user's input right before sending it.
    `console.log('[Component] User clicked save. Sending data:', dataToSend);`
2.  **Frontend Service (`api.service.ts`):** Log the data just before it's sent over the network.
    `console.log('[API Service] Making POST request to /api/data with body:', body);`
3.  **Backend Route (`server.ts`):** Log the data as soon as it's received by the server.
    `console.log('[API Route] Received POST request on /api/data with body:', req.body);`
4.  **Backend Service (`database.service.ts`):** Log the data just before it's written to the database.
    `console.log('[DB Service] Attempting to write to database:', data);`

By following the logs through this chain, you can identify exactly where the data becomes corrupted, is dropped, or causes an error.

# Artifact T10: Template - Feature Plan Example
# Date Created: C141
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a feature plan, using a right-click context menu as an example.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup

## 1. Overview & Goal

This document outlines the plan for implementing a standard right-click context menu. The goal is to provide essential management operations directly within the application, reducing the need for users to switch contexts for common tasks.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| US-01 | **Copy Item Name** | As a user, I want to right-click an item and copy its name to my clipboard, so I can easily reference it elsewhere. | - Right-clicking an item opens a context menu. <br> - The menu contains a "Copy Name" option. <br> - Selecting the option copies the item's name string to the system clipboard. |
| US-02 | **Rename Item** | As a user, I want to right-click an item and rename it, so I can correct mistakes or update its label. | - The context menu contains a "Rename" option. <br> - Selecting it turns the item's name into an editable input field. <br> - Pressing Enter or clicking away saves the new name. |
| US-03 | **Delete Item** | As a user, I want to right-click an item and delete it, so I can remove unnecessary items. | - The context menu contains a "Delete" option. <br> - Selecting it shows a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion. <br> - Upon confirmation, the item is removed. |

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

-   **State Management:** Introduce new state to manage the context menu's visibility and position: `const [contextMenu, setContextMenu] = useState<{ x: number; y: number; item: any } | null>(null);`.
-   **Event Handling:** Add an `onContextMenu` handler to the item element. This will prevent the default browser menu and set the state to show our custom menu at the event's coordinates.
-   **New Menu Component:** Render a custom context menu component conditionally based on the `contextMenu` state. It will contain the options defined in the user stories.
-   **Action Handlers:** Implement the functions for `handleRename`, `handleDelete`, etc. These will be called by the menu items' `onClick` handlers.
-   **Overlay:** An overlay will be added to the entire screen when the menu is open. Clicking this overlay will close the menu.

# Artifact T13: Template - Refactoring Plan
# Date Created: C152
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a refactoring plan, guiding users to consider constraints like token count.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup, refactor

## 1. Problem Statement

The file `[path/to/problematic/file.ts]` has become difficult to maintain due to [e.g., its large size, high complexity, mixing of multiple responsibilities]. This is leading to [e.g., slower development, increased bugs, high token count for LLM context].

## 2. Refactoring Goals

1.  **Improve Readability:** Make the code easier to understand and follow.
2.  **Reduce Complexity:** Break down large functions and classes into smaller, more focused units.
3.  **Increase Maintainability:** Make it easier to add new features or fix bugs in the future.
4.  **Constraint:** The primary constraint for this refactor is to **reduce the token count** of the file(s) to make them more manageable for AI-assisted development.

## 3. Proposed Refactoring Plan

The monolithic file/class will be broken down into the following smaller, more focused modules/services:

### 3.1. New Service/Module A: `[e.g., DataProcessingService.ts]`

-   **Responsibility:** This service will be responsible for all logic related to [e.g., processing raw data].
-   **Functions/Methods to move here:**
    -   `functionA()`
    -   `functionB()`

### 3.2. New Service/Module B: `[e.g., ApiClientService.ts]`

-   **Responsibility:** This service will encapsulate all external API communication.
-   **Functions/Methods to move here:**
    -   `fetchDataFromApi()`
    -   `postDataToApi()`

### 3.3. Original File (`[e.g., MainController.ts]`):

-   **Responsibility:** The original file will be simplified to act as a coordinator, orchestrating calls to the new services.
-   **Changes:**
    -   Remove the moved functions.
    -   Import and instantiate the new services.
    -   Update the main logic to delegate work to the appropriate service.

## 4. Benefits

-   **Reduced Token Count:** The original file's token count will be significantly reduced.
-   **Improved Maintainability:** Each new service has a single, clear responsibility.
-   **Easier Testing:** The smaller, focused services will be easier to unit test in isolation.

# Artifact T15: Template - A-B-C Testing Strategy for UI Bugs
# Date Created: C154
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a guide on using the A-B-C testing pattern to diagnose UI bugs.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, process, debugging, troubleshooting

## 1. Overview & Goal

When a user interface (UI) bug, particularly related to event handling (`onClick`, `onDrop`, etc.), proves resistant to conventional debugging, it often indicates a complex root cause. Continuously attempting small fixes on the main, complex component can be inefficient.

The goal of the **A-B-C Testing Strategy** is to break this cycle by creating a test harness with multiple, simplified, independent test components. Each test component attempts to solve the same basic problem using a slightly different technical approach, allowing for rapid diagnosis.

## 2. The Strategy

### 2.1. Core Principles
1.  **Preserve the Original:** Never remove existing functionality to build a test case. The original component should remain as the "control" in the experiment.
2.  **Isolate Variables:** Each test case should be as simple as possible, designed to test a single variable (e.g., raw event handling vs. local state updates).
3.  **Run in Parallel:** The original component and all test components should be accessible from the same UI (e.g., via tabs) for immediate comparison.

### 2.2. Steps
1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** Isolate the most fundamental action that is failing (e.g., "A click on a list item is not being registered").
2.  **Create Test Harness:** Refactor the main view to act as a "test harness" that can switch between the original component and several new test components.
3.  **Implement Isolated Test Components:** Create new, simple components for each test case.
    *   **Test A (Barebones):** The simplest possible implementation. Use raw HTML elements with inline event handlers that only log to the console.
    *   **Test B (Local State):** Introduce state management to test the component's ability to re-render on an event.
    *   **Test C (Prop-Driven):** Use a child component that calls a function passed down via props, testing the prop-drilling pattern.
4.  **Analyze Results:** Interact with each tab to see which implementation succeeds, thereby isolating the architectural pattern that is failing.

## 3. Cleanup Process

Once a working pattern is identified in a test component:
1.  **Codify Findings:** Document the successful pattern and the root cause of the failure.
2.  **Integrate Solution:** Refactor the original component to use the successful pattern.
3.  **Remove Test Artifacts:** Delete the test harness UI and the temporary test component files.

# Artifact T16: [Project Name] - Developer Environment Setup Guide Template
# Date Created: C158
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C160 (Add section for managing environment variables)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a guide on setting up a new project's development environment, including OS, tools, and installation steps.
- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup, environment

## 1. Overview

This document provides a step-by-step guide for setting up the local development environment required to build and run **[Project Name]**. Following these instructions will ensure that all developers have a consistent and correct setup.

## 2. System Requirements

Before you begin, please ensure your system meets the following requirements. This information is critical for providing the correct commands and troubleshooting steps in subsequent development cycles.

-   **Operating System:** [e.g., Windows 11, macOS Sonoma, Ubuntu 22.04]
-   **Package Manager:** [e.g., npm, yarn, pnpm]
-   **Node.js Version:** [e.g., v20.11.0 or later]
-   **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code (Recommended)

## 3. Required Tools & Software

Please install the following tools if you do not already have them:

1.  **Node.js:** [Provide a link to the official Node.js download page: https://nodejs.org/]
2.  **Git:** [Provide a link to the official Git download page: https://git-scm.com/downloads]
3.  **[Any other required tool, e.g., Docker, Python]:** [Link to installation guide]

## 4. Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.

```bash
# Replace with your repository URL
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

### Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

Next, install all the necessary project dependencies using your package manager.

```bash
# For npm
npm install

# For yarn
# yarn install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and fill in the required environment variables:
-   `API_KEY`: [Description of what this key is for]
-   `DATABASE_URL`: [Description of the database connection string]

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

To start the local development server, run the following command. This will typically compile the code and watch for any changes you make.

```bash
# For npm
npm run dev

# For yarn
# yarn dev
```

### Step 5: Verify the Setup

Once the development server is running, you should be able to access the application at [e.g., `http://localhost:3000`]. [Describe what the developer should see to confirm that the setup was successful].

## 5. Managing Environment Variables and Secrets

To provide an AI assistant with the necessary context about which environment variables are available without exposing sensitive secrets, follow this best practice:

1.  **Create a `.env.local` file:** Make a copy of your `.env` file and name it `.env.local`.
2.  **Redact Secret Values:** In the `.env.local` file, replace all sensitive values (like API keys, passwords, or tokens) with the placeholder `[REDACTED]`.
3.  **Include in Context:** When curating your context for the AI, check the box for the `.env.local` file.
4.  **Exclude `.env`:** Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes `.env` to prevent your actual secrets from ever being committed to version control.

This allows the AI to see the names of all available constants (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) so it can write code that uses them correctly, but it never sees the actual secret values.

<T17. Template - Universal Task Checklist.md>
# Artifact A[XX]: [Project Name] - Universal Task Checklist
# Date Created: C[XX]
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C10 (Add guidance for planning next cycle)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A generic template for a universal task checklist, designed to organize work by file and complexity.
- **Tags:** template, process, checklist, task management, planning

## 1. Purpose

This artifact provides a structured, universal format for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs. Unlike cycle-specific trackers, this checklist organizes work by the group of files involved in a given task. It also introduces a simple complexity metric based on the total token count of the affected files and an estimation of whether the task will require more than one development cycle to complete.

This file-centric approach helps in planning and prioritizing work, especially in an AI-assisted development workflow where context size (token count) is a primary constraint.

## 2. How to Use

-   **Group by File Packages:** Create a new `##` section for each logical task or feature. List all the files that are expected to be modified for this task.
-   **Assign an ID:** Give each task package a unique, simple ID (e.g., `T-1`, `T-2`) for easy reference in feedback.
-   **Estimate Complexity:**
    -   Calculate the **Total Tokens** for all files in the package. This gives a quantitative measure of the context size.
    -   Estimate if the task is likely to take **More than one cycle?**. This is a qualitative judgment based on the complexity of the changes required.
-   **List Action Items:** Under each file package, create a checklist of specific actions, bugs to fix, or features to implement.
-   **Add Verification Steps:** After the action items, add a section describing how the curator should test the feature to confirm it is working as expected.
-   **Note on Output Length:** Remember that the maximum output length for a single response is approximately 65,000 tokens. Do not prematurely stop generating files; attempt to complete as many full files as possible within this limit.
-   **Plan for the Future:** Always conclude your task list with a final task to create the checklist for the next cycle (e.g., `T-X: Create A[XX+1] Universal Task Checklist for Cycle [Y+]`). This creates a continuous planning loop.
-   **Keep it Current:** At the beginning of each new cycle, review and update this checklist. Move completed tasks to a "Completed" section, add new tasks based on feedback, and re-prioritize as needed. This ensures the checklist remains a living, accurate reflection of the project's status.

<file path="src/Artifacts/A5-Dual Domain Hosting Guide.md">
# Artifact A114: AI Ascent - Dual Domain Hosting Guide
# Date Created: C117
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A guide explaining how to host multiple domains (e.g., `aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev`) on a single server using a reverse proxy like Caddy.
- **Tags:** guide, networking, hosting, reverse proxy, caddy, dns

## 1. Overview & Goal

You have asked if it's possible to host both `aiascent.game` and the new `aiascent.dev` on the same server that is currently hosting the game and the vLLM instance. The answer is **yes**, and this is a standard and efficient way to manage multiple websites on a single machine.

The goal of this guide is to explain the technical concept of a **reverse proxy** and provide a concrete example of how to configure it using Caddy, which you are already using.

## 2. The Core Concept: Reverse Proxy with Virtual Hosts

The magic that makes this work is a **reverse proxy** that uses **virtual hosts**. Here's how the pieces fit together:

1.  **DNS Records:** You will configure the DNS "A" records for both `aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev` to point to the **same public IP address**—the one for your home server.

2.  **Port Forwarding:** Your AT&T router will continue to forward all web traffic (ports 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS) to the single PC in your closet that acts as the server.

3.  **The Reverse Proxy (Caddy):** This is the traffic controller. Caddy will be the only process listening on ports 80 and 443. When a request comes in, Caddy inspects the `Host` header to see which domain the user was trying to reach.
    *   If the `Host` is `aiascent.game`, Caddy forwards the request to the Node.js process running your game.
    *   If the `Host` is `aiascent.dev`, Caddy forwards the request to the *different* Node.js process running your new website.

4.  **Backend Applications:** Each of your applications (the game server, the new website server) will run on its own, separate, internal-only port (e.g., 3001 for the game, 3002 for the new website). They don't need to know anything about HTTPS or the public domains.

This architecture is secure, efficient, and makes adding more websites in the future very simple.

## 3. Example Caddyfile Configuration

Your existing `Caddyfile` (from `A91`) is already set up to handle `aiascent.game`. To add the new `aiascent.dev` site, you simply need to add another block to the file.

Let's assume:
*   Your `aiascent.game` Node.js server runs on `localhost:3001`.
*   Your new `aiascent-dev` Next.js server will run on `localhost:3002`.

Your new `Caddyfile` would look like this:

```caddy
# Caddyfile for dual domain hosting

aiascent.game {
    # Caddy will automatically handle HTTPS for this domain.
    encode zstd gzip
    log {
        output file /var/log/caddy/aiascent_game.log
    }

    # Reverse proxy all requests for aiascent.game to the game server on port 3001.
    reverse_proxy localhost:3001 {
        header_up Host {host}
        header_up X-Real-IP {remote_ip}
        header_up X-Forwarded-For {remote_ip}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}
        header_up Connection {>Connection}
        header_up Upgrade {>Upgrade}
    }
}

aiascent.dev {
    # Caddy will automatically handle HTTPS for this domain as well.
    encode zstd gzip
    log {
        output file /var/log/caddy/aiascent_dev.log
    }

    # Reverse proxy all requests for aiascent.dev to the new website server on port 3002.
    reverse_proxy localhost:3002
}

# Optional: Redirect www versions to the main domains
www.aiascent.game {
    redir https://aiascent.game{uri} permanent
}
www.aiascent.dev {
    redir https://aiascent.dev{uri} permanent
}
```

### 4. Action Steps

1.  **DNS:** Point the `aiascent.dev` A record to your server's public IP address.
2.  **Application Ports:** Ensure your two applications are configured to run on different ports (e.g., 3001 and 3002).
3.  **Caddyfile:** Update your `Caddyfile` with the new block for `aiascent.dev`.
4.  **Reload Caddy:** Run `caddy reload` in your server's terminal to apply the new configuration.

Caddy will automatically obtain the SSL certificate for `aiascent.dev` and begin routing traffic to the correct application based on the domain name.

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A list of recommended documentation artifacts to port from the DCE project to the new `aiascent.dev` project to bootstrap its development process.
- **Tags:** guide, documentation, project setup, aiascent-dev

## 1. Overview

To effectively bootstrap the `aiascent.dev` project using the Data Curation Environment (DCE), it is highly recommended to port over a set of existing documentation artifacts from the DCE project itself. These artifacts codify the development process, workflow, and interaction patterns that will be essential for building the new website.

This guide lists the specific artifacts you should copy from your main `DCE/src/Artifacts` directory into the `aiascent-dev/context/dce/` directory.

## 2. Recommended Artifacts to Port

The following artifacts provide the "source of truth" for the DCE-driven development process. They will be invaluable as context when prompting the AI to build the `aiascent.dev` website.

### Core Process & Workflow
*   **`A0. DCE Master Artifact List.md`**: Provides the structure and concept of the master list.
*   **`A9. DCE - GitHub Repository Setup Guide.md`**: Essential for initializing the new project's version control.
*   **`A65. DCE - Universal Task Checklist.md`**: The template and philosophy for organizing work in cycles.
*   **`A69. DCE - Animated UI Workflow Guide.md`**: Documents the "perfect loop" of the DCE workflow, which is a key concept to showcase and teach.
*   **`A70. DCE - Git-Integrated Testing Workflow Plan.md`**: The baseline/restore workflow is a core feature of the development process that should be used for the new project.
*   **`A72. DCE - README for Artifacts.md`**: Explains the purpose of the artifacts directory to both the user and the AI.

### Interaction & Parsing
*   **`A52.1 DCE - Parser Logic and AI Guidance.md`**: Provides the AI with the literal parser code, enabling metainterpretability.
*   **`A52.2 DCE - Interaction Schema Source.md`**: The canonical rules for how the AI should structure its responses to be parsed correctly by the DCE.

### Content & Showcase
*   **`A77. DCE - Whitepaper Generation Plan.md`**: The original plan for generating the whitepaper.
*   **`A78. DCE - Whitepaper - Process as Asset.md`**: The full content of the whitepaper that you intend to display in the interactive report viewer.
*   **`reportContent.json`**: The structured JSON data from `aiascent.game`'s report viewer, which can be used as the data source for the new `InteractiveWhitepaper` component.

### 3. Procedure

1.  Navigate to your `C:\Projects\DCE\src\Artifacts` directory.
2.  Copy the files listed above.
3.  Paste them into the `C:\Projects\aiascent-dev\context\dce\` directory.
4.  You can now use these files as part of the context when generating prompts for the `aiascent.dev` project within the DCE.

  - **Key/Value for A0:**
  - **Description:** A guide providing the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the aiascent.dev Next.js website locally.
  - **Tags:** documentation, project setup, development, testing, nextjs, workflow

## 1. Purpose

This guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **aiascent.dev** application locally.

## 2. Development Workflow

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Ensure all project dependencies are installed. Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
# or if using yarn
# yarn install
```

### Step 2: Start the Development Server

To compile the code and start the Next.js development server with hot-reloading, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Running the Application

Once the development server is running, it will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your web browser to view the application. The server will automatically refresh the page when you save changes to the source files.

### Step 4: Debugging

Debugging is primarily done using the browser's developer tools (DevTools).

  - **Client-Side Debugging:** Open DevTools (F12 or right-click -> Inspect) and navigate to the "Console" tab for logs or the "Sources" (Chrome/Edge) / "Debugger" (Firefox) tab to set breakpoints directly in the TypeScript source code (thanks to source maps).
  - **React State:** Install the React Developer Tools browser extension to inspect component state and props.

## 3. Testing

The project will be configured with a testing framework (e.g., Jest and React Testing Library) as development progresses. To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.

## 4. Building for Production

To create an optimized production build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates the necessary files for deployment. You can then run the production build locally using:

```bash
npm run start

# Artifact A9: aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide
# Date Created: C0
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A step-by-step guide with the necessary git commands to initialize the project as a local repository and push it to a new remote repository on GitHub.
- **Tags:** git, github, version control, setup, repository, workflow

## 1. Overview

This guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent-dev` project folder into a Git repository and link it to a new, empty repository on GitHub.

## 2. Prerequisites

*   You have `git` installed on your machine.
*   You have a GitHub account.

## 3. Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **"New repository"**.
3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev`.
4.  **Description:** "Promotional and educational website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension."
5.  Choose **"Private"** or **"Public"**.
6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.
7.  Click **"Create repository"**.

GitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions. We will use the section titled **"...or push an existing repository from the command line"**.

### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project

Open a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory (`C:\Projects\aiascent-dev`). Then, run the following commands one by one.

1.  **Initialize the repository:**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add all existing files:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Create the first commit:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Project setup and Cycle 0 artifacts"
    ```

4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```

### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub

1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your new GitHub repository page.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git
    ```

2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

Your new project is now set up with version control and linked to GitHub. You can now use the DCE's Git-integrated features like "Baseline" and "Restore" as you develop the website.

# Artifact A72: DCE - README for Artifacts
# Date Created: C158
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C183 (Strengthen Git initialization and `.gitignore` guidance)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** The content for the `README.md` file that is automatically created in a new project's `src/Artifacts` directory, explaining the purpose of the extension and the artifact-driven workflow.
- **Tags:** documentation, onboarding, readme, source of truth

## 1. Welcome to the Data Curation Environment (DCE)

This directory (`src/Artifacts/`) is the heart of your project's planning and documentation. It's managed by the **Data Curation Environment (DCE)**, a VS Code extension designed to streamline AI-assisted development.

This `README.md` file was automatically generated to provide context for you (the developer) and for the AI assistants you will be working with.

## 2. What is an "Artifact"?

In the context of this workflow, an **Artifact** is a formal, written document that serves as a "source of truth" for a specific part of your project. Think of these files as the official blueprints, plans, and records.

The core principle of the DCE workflow is **"Documentation First."** Before writing code, you and your AI partner should first create or update an artifact that describes the plan.

## 3. The Iterative Cycle Workflow

Development in the DCE is organized into **Cycles**. You have just completed the initial setup.

### Your Next Steps

1.  **Initialize Your Git Repository (CRITICAL):**
    To take full advantage of the DCE's testing workflow (creating baselines and restoring changes), you **must** initialize a Git repository.
    
    Open a terminal in your project's root directory (you can use the integrated terminal in VS Code: `Terminal > New Terminal`) and run the following commands:
    ```bash
    git init
    # Create or update your .gitignore file with the line below
    echo ".vscode/" >> .gitignore
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
    **Why `.gitignore`?** The DCE saves its state in a `.vscode/dce_history.json` file. Adding `.vscode/` to your `.gitignore` is crucial to prevent the extension's UI from flashing every time it auto-saves. For a complete guide, refer to the `GitHub Repository Setup Guide.md` artifact.

2.  **Submit Your First Prompt:** The `prompt.md` file has been automatically opened for you. This file contains your project plan and instructions for the AI. Copy its entire contents and paste it into your preferred AI chat interface (like Google's AI Studio, ChatGPT, etc.).

3.  **Review and Accept Responses:** Paste the AI's responses back into the "Resp 1", "Resp 2", etc. tabs in the Parallel Co-Pilot panel. The UI will guide you through parsing the responses, selecting the best one, and accepting its changes into your workspace.

4.  **Repeat:** This completes a cycle. You then start the next cycle, building upon the newly accepted code and documentation.

This structured, iterative process helps maintain project quality and ensures that both human and AI developers are always aligned with the project's goals.

# Artifact A1: DCE - Project Vision and Goals
# Date Created: Cycle 1
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C87 (Shifted Diff Tool to Phase 2, defined Phase 3 as LLM Integration)

## 1. Project Vision

The vision of the Data Curation Environment (DCE) is to create a seamless, integrated toolset within VS Code that streamlines the workflow of interacting with large language models. The core problem this project solves is the manual, cumbersome process of selecting, packaging, and managing the context (code files, documents, etc.) required for effective AI-assisted development.

## 2. High-Level Goals & Phases

The project will be developed in three distinct phases.

**Note on Reference Repository:** The discovery of the `The-Creator-AI-main` repository in Cycle 2 has provided a significant head-start, especially for Phase 1 and 2. The project's focus shifts from building these components from the ground up to adapting and extending the powerful, existing foundation.

### Phase 1: The Context Chooser

The goal of this phase is to eliminate the manual management of a `files_list.txt`. Users should be able to intuitively select files and folders for their AI context directly within the VS Code file explorer UI.

-   **Core Functionality:** Implement a file explorer view with checkboxes for every file and folder.
-   **Action:** A "Flatten Context" button will take all checked items and generate a single `flattened_repo.md` file in the project root.
-   **Outcome:** A user can curate a complex context with simple mouse clicks, completely removing the need to edit a text file.
-   **Status:** Largely complete.

### Phase 2: The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel & Integrated Diff Tool

This phase addresses the limitation of being locked into a single conversation with an AI assistant and brings the critical "diffing" workflow directly into the extension. The goal is to enable multiple, parallel interactions and to create a navigable record of the AI-driven development process.

-   **Core Functionality (Parallel Co-Pilot):** Create a custom panel within VS Code that hosts a multi-tabbed text editor. Users can manually paste or have the extension ingest different AI-generated code responses into each tab for side-by-side comparison.
-   **Key Feature ("Swap & Test"):** A button on each tab allows the user to "swap" the content of that tab with the corresponding source file in their workspace. This provides an immediate, low-friction way to test a given AI response.
-   **Core Functionality (Integrated Diff):** The panel will include a built-in diff viewer to compare the content of any two tabs, or a tab and the source file. This eliminates the need for external tools like WinMerge.
-   **Core Functionality (Cycle Navigator):** Integrate a UI element to navigate back and forth between development cycles. Each cycle will be associated with the set of AI responses generated during that cycle.
-   **Outcome:** A user can efficiently manage, compare, and test multiple AI solutions, and also review the historical evolution of the code by navigating through past cycles and their corresponding AI suggestions, creating a powerful "knowledge graph" of the project's development.

### Phase 3: Advanced AI & Local LLM Integration

This phase focuses on deeper integration with AI services and providing support for local models.

-   **Core Functionality:** Implement direct API calls to various LLM providers (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic) from within the Parallel Co-Pilot panel, populating the tabs automatically. This requires building a secure API key management system.
-   **Local LLM Support:** Allow users to configure an endpoint URL for a locally hosted LLM (e.g., via LM Studio, Ollama), enabling fully offline and private AI-assisted development.
-   **Outcome:** The DCE becomes a fully-featured AI interaction environment, supporting both cloud and local models, and automating the entire prompt-to-test workflow.

# Artifact A9: DCE - GitHub Repository Setup Guide
# Date Created: Cycle 12
# Author: AI Model
# Updated on: C160 (Add sample workflow with `git restore`)

- **Description:** A step-by-step guide with the necessary git commands to initialize the project as a local repository and push it to a new remote repository on GitHub, including a sample workflow for testing AI responses.
- **Tags:** git, github, version control, setup, repository, workflow

## 1. Overview

This guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local project folder into a Git repository and link it to a new, empty repository on GitHub. It also describes a sample workflow for using Git to efficiently test multiple AI-generated responses.

## 2. Prerequisites

*   You have `git` installed on your machine.
*   You have a GitHub account.

## 3. Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **"New repository"**.
3.  **Repository name:** A good name would be `data-curation-environment` or `vscode-dce-extension`.
4.  **Description:** (Optional) "A VS Code extension for curating context for Large Language Models."
5.  Choose **"Private"** or **"Public"** based on your preference.
6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files, and this will prevent conflicts.
7.  Click **"Create repository"**.

GitHub will now show you a page with several command-line instructions. We will use the section titled **"...or push an existing repository from the command line"**.

### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project

Open a terminal (like the one integrated into VS Code) and navigate to your project's root directory (e.g., `C:\Projects\DCE`). Then, run the following commands one by one.

1.  **Initialize the repository:** This creates a new `.git` subdirectory in your project folder.
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add all existing files to the staging area:** The `.` adds all files in the current directory and subdirectories.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Create the first commit:** This saves the staged files to the repository's history.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:** This is the modern standard, replacing the older `master`.
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```

### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub

Now, you will link your local repository to the empty one you created on GitHub.

1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the URL with the one from your GitHub repository page. It should look like the example below.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/dgerabagi/data-curation-environment.git
    ```

2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:** The `-u` flag sets the upstream remote so that in the future, you can simply run `git push`.
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

After these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files. You have successfully created and linked your repository.

## 4. Sample Workflow for Testing AI Responses

Once your project is set up with Git, you can leverage it to create a powerful and non-destructive testing workflow with the DCE.

1.  **Start with a Clean State:** Make sure your working directory is clean. You can check this with `git status`. If you have any uncommitted changes, either commit them or stash them.
2.  **Generate Responses:** Use the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file and get several responses from your AI. Paste these into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and parse them.
3.  **Accept a Response:** Choose the response you want to test (e.g., "Resp 1"). Select its files in the "Associated Files" list and click "Accept Selected Files". This will overwrite the files in your workspace.
4.  **Test the Changes:** Run your project's build process (`npm run watch`), check for errors, and test the functionality in the VS Code Extension Development Host.
5.  **Revert and Test the Next One:**
    *   If you're not satisfied with the changes from "Resp 1," you can instantly and safely revert all the changes by running a single command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        git restore .
        ```
    *   This command discards all uncommitted changes in your working directory, restoring your files to the state of your last commit.
6.  **Repeat:** Your workspace is now clean again. You can go back to the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, accept the files from "Resp 2," and repeat the testing process.

This workflow allows you to rapidly test multiple complex, multi-file changes from different AI responses without the risk of permanently breaking your codebase.

<file path="src/Artifacts/A65. DCE - Universal Task Checklist.md">
# Artifact A65: DCE - Universal Task Checklist
# Date Created: C165
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C22 (Add new tasks from playtest feedback)

## 1. Purpose

This artifact provides a structured, universal format for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs. Unlike cycle-specific trackers, this checklist organizes work by the group of files involved in a given task. It also introduces a simple complexity metric based on the total token count of the affected files and an estimation of whether the task will require more than one development cycle to complete.

This file-centric approach helps in planning and prioritizing work, especially in an AI-assisted development workflow where context size (token count) is a primary constraint.

## 2. How to Use

-   **Group by File Packages:** Create a new `##` section for each logical task or feature. List all the files that are expected to be modified for this task.
-   **Assign an ID:** Give each task package a unique, simple ID (e.g., `T-1`, `T-2`) for easy reference in feedback.
-   **Estimate Complexity:**
    -   Calculate the **Total Tokens** for all files in the package. This gives a quantitative measure of the context size.
    -   Estimate if the task is likely to take **More than one cycle?**. This is a qualitative judgment based on the complexity of the changes required.
-   **List Action Items:** Under each file package, create a checklist of specific actions, bugs to fix, or features to implement.
-   **Add Verification Steps:** After the action items, add a section describing how the curator should test the feature to confirm it is working as expected.
-   **Note on Output Length:** Remember that the maximum output length for a single response is approximately 65,000 tokens. Do not prematurely stop generating files; attempt to complete as many full files as possible within this limit.
-   **Keep it Current:** At the beginning of each new cycle, review and update this checklist. Move completed tasks to a "Completed" section, add new tasks based on feedback, and re-prioritize as needed. This ensures the checklist remains a living, accurate reflection of the project's status.

# Artifact A69: DCE - Animated UI Workflow Guide
# Date Created: C169
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C187 (Correct final workflow steps)

## 1. Overview & Goal

The Parallel Co-Pilot Panel (PCPP) has a powerful, multi-step workflow that may not be immediately obvious to new users. The goal of this feature is to implement a guided experience using subtle UI animations. These animations will highlight the next logical action the user should take, gently guiding them through the process from project creation to generating the next cycle's prompt.

## 2. User Story

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-WF-01 | **Guided Workflow** | As a new user, I want the UI to visually guide me through the steps of a development cycle, so I can learn the workflow intuitively. | - After a specific action is completed, the UI element for the next logical action is highlighted with a subtle animation (e.g., a pulsing blue glow). |

## 3. The Animated Workflow Sequence (The Perfect Loop)

The highlighting will follow this specific sequence of user actions:

### Onboarding / Cycle 0
1.  **Start (New Workspace):** User opens a new, empty folder in VS Code.
    *   **Auto-Action:** The **DCE Parallel Co-Pilot Panel** automatically opens.

2.  **Open PCPP (Welcome View):** The PCPP is open to the "Welcome" / "Onboarding" view.
    *   **Highlight:** The **Project Scope `textarea`** pulses.

3.  **Input Project Scope:** User types their project plan into the `textarea`.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Generate Initial Artifacts Prompt`** button pulses.

4.  **Generate `prompt.md`:** User clicks the button. `prompt.md` and `DCE_README.md` are created. The view transitions to Cycle 1.
    *   **Auto-Action:** `prompt.md` and `src/Artifacts/DCE_README.md` are automatically opened in the editor.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Resp 1`** tab in the PCPP pulses.

### Main Loop (Cycle 1+)
5.  **Paste Responses:** The user gets responses from an LLM and pastes them into the response tabs.
    *   **Highlight:** The highlight moves sequentially from **`Resp 1`** to **`Resp 2`**, etc., as each `textarea` is filled.
    *   **Trigger:** Once content is present in all tabs, the highlight moves to the next step.

6.  **Parse Responses:**
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Parse All`** button pulses.

7.  **Sort Responses:** User clicks `Parse All`.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Sort`** button pulses. (Skips if already sorted).

8.  **Select a Response:** User reviews the responses.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Select This Response`** button on each tab pulses.

9.  **Create Baseline:** User clicks `Select This Response`.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Baseline (Commit)`** button pulses.
    *   **State-Aware Skip:** This step is skipped if the backend reports that the Git working tree is already clean.

10. **Select Files for Acceptance:** A successful baseline is created.
    *   **Highlight:** The "Associated Files" list panel and the **`Select All`** button within it pulse.

11. **Accept Changes:** User checks one or more files in the "Associated Files" list.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Accept Selected`** button pulses.

12. **Write Context:** User clicks `Accept Selected`.
    *   **Highlight:** The **"Cycle Context"** `textarea` pulses.

13. **Write Title:** User types into the "Cycle Context" `textarea`.
    *   **Highlight:** The **"Cycle Title"** input field pulses.

14. **Generate Next Prompt:** User types a bespoke "Cycle Title".
    *   **Highlight:** The **`Generate prompt.md`** button pulses.

15. **Create New Cycle:** User clicks `Generate prompt.md`.
    *   **Highlight:** The **`[ + ]` (New Cycle)** button pulses, completing the loop and preparing for the next iteration which starts back at Step 5.

A core part of the DCE workflow involves accepting an AI-generated response and testing it in the live workspace. If the response introduces bugs, the user must manually revert the changes. The goal of this feature is to automate this "test and revert" loop by deeply integrating with Git. This will provide a one-click method to create a baseline commit before testing and a one-click method to restore that baseline if the test fails.

**Status (C187):** In Progress.

## 2. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P2-GIT-01 | **Create Baseline** | As a developer, after accepting an AI response but before testing it, I want to click a "Baseline (Commit)" button to create a Git commit, so I have a safe restore point. | - A "Baseline (Commit)" button is available in the response acceptance header. <br> - Clicking it executes `git add .` and `git commit -m "DCE Baseline: Cycle [currentCycle] - [cycleTitle]"`. <br> - A "Successfully created baseline commit" notification is shown. |
| P2-GIT-02 | **Restore Baseline** | As a developer, after testing an AI response and finding issues, I want to click a "Restore Baseline" button to discard all changes, so I can quickly test a different response. | - A "Restore Baseline" button is available. <br> - Clicking it executes `git restore .` to revert changes to tracked files. <br> - It also deletes any new, untracked files that were part of the accepted AI response, leaving other untracked files untouched. <br> - The restore operation must **exclude** DCE-specific state files (e.g., `.vscode/dce_history.json`) to prevent data loss. |
| P2-GIT-03 | **State-Aware Baseline** | As a developer, I don't want to be prompted to create a baseline if my project is already in a clean state, and I want clear feedback if I try to baseline an already-clean repository. | - Before highlighting the "Baseline" button, the extension checks the `git status`. <br> - If the working tree is clean, the "Baseline" step in the animated workflow is skipped. <br> - If the user manually clicks "Baseline" on a clean tree, a message like "Already baselined" is shown. |
| P2-GIT-04 | **Guided Git Initialization** | As a new user who hasn't initialized a Git repository, when I click "Baseline," I want to see a clear error message that tells me what's wrong and gives me the option to fix it with one click. | - If `git` is not initialized, clicking "Baseline" shows a `vscode.window.showErrorMessage`. <br> - The message explains that the folder is not a Git repository. <br> - The message includes an "Open README Guide" button that opens the project's `DCE_README.md`. <br> - The message also includes an "Initialize Repository" button that, when clicked, automatically runs `git init` in the workspace. |
| P2-GIT-05 | **Post-Baseline Workflow** | As a developer, after a successful baseline is created, I want the animated guide to immediately advance to the next step, so I know what to do next. | - After a successful baseline commit, the animated workflow highlight immediately moves to the "Select All" button in the "Associated Files" list. |

## 3. Feasibility Analysis

-   **"Insanely Powerful" Idea (Simulate TS Errors):**
    -   **Concept:** Programmatically run the TypeScript compiler on a virtual file system containing the proposed changes and display the resulting errors without modifying the user's workspace.
    -   **Feasibility:** This is a highly complex task. It would require integrating the TypeScript compiler API, creating an in-memory representation of the workspace file system, and managing dependencies. While theoretically possible, this is a very advanced feature that would require significant research and multiple development cycles.
    -   **Recommendation:** Defer as a long-term research goal.

-   **"Baseline/Restore" Idea:**
    -   **Concept:** Execute standard Git commands from the extension backend.
    -   **Feasibility:** This is highly feasible. The VS Code Git extension exposes an API that can be used to run commands, or a child process can be used to execute the `git` CLI directly. The main challenge is ensuring the `git restore` command excludes the necessary files.
    -   **Recommendation:** Proceed with planning and implementation.

## 4. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **IPC Channels:**
    *   `ClientToServerChannel.RequestGitBaseline`: Payload `{ commitMessage: string }`.
    *   `ClientToServerChannel.RequestGitRestore`: Payload `{ filesToDelete: string[] }`.
    *   `ClientToServerChannel.RequestGitStatus`: No payload.
    *   `ClientToServerChannel.RequestGitInit`: (New) No payload.
    *   `ServerToClientChannel.SendGitStatus`: Payload `{ isClean: boolean }`.
    *   `ServerToClientChannel.NotifyGitOperationResult`: Payload `{ success: boolean; message: string; }`. This channel is critical for the backend to provide explicit feedback to the frontend's workflow state machine.

2.  **Backend (New `GitService` - See `A73`):**
    *   A new `GitService` will encapsulate all Git command logic.
    *   **`handleGitStatusRequest()`:** A new handler that runs `git status --porcelain`. If the output is empty, it sends `{ isClean: true }` to the frontend.
    *   **`handleGitBaselineRequest(commitMessage)`:**
        *   Checks the status first. If clean, it returns a specific "Already baselined" result.
        *   Otherwise, it executes `git add .` and `git commit -m "..."`.
        *   **Crucially, it will have a specific `catch` block for "not a git repository" errors. This block will trigger the user-facing `showErrorMessage` with the two action buttons.**
    *   **`handleGitRestoreRequest({ filesToDelete })`:**
        *   Executes `git restore -- . ':(exclude).vscode/dce_history.json'`.
        *   Iterates through `filesToDelete` and deletes each one using `vscode.workspace.fs.delete`.
        *   Returns a result object.
    *   **`handleGitInitRequest()`:** (New) A new handler that executes `git init` and returns a success/failure result.

3.  **Frontend (`view.tsx`):**
    *   The frontend will request the Git status at appropriate times to drive the workflow state.
    *   The `onClick` handler for "Baseline" will construct the commit message and send the `RequestGitBaseline` message.
    *   The `onClick` handler for "Restore" will determine which files were newly created and send them in the `RequestGitRestore` message.
    *   A new message handler for `NotifyGitOperationResult` will display the result message and, if successful, will advance the `workflowStep` state from `awaitingBaseline` to `awaitingFileSelect`.

# Artifact A72: DCE - README for Artifacts
# Date Created: C158
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C183 (Strengthen Git initialization and `.gitignore` guidance)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** The content for the `README.md` file that is automatically created in a new project's `src/Artifacts` directory, explaining the purpose of the extension and the artifact-driven workflow.
- **Tags:** documentation, onboarding, readme, source of truth

## 1. Welcome to the Data Curation Environment (DCE)

This directory (`src/Artifacts/`) is the heart of your project's planning and documentation. It's managed by the **Data Curation Environment (DCE)**, a VS Code extension designed to streamline AI-assisted development.

This `README.md` file was automatically generated to provide context for you (the developer) and for the AI assistants you will be working with.

## 2. What is an "Artifact"?

In the context of this workflow, an **Artifact** is a formal, written document that serves as a "source of truth" for a specific part of your project. Think of these files as the official blueprints, plans, and records.

The core principle of the DCE workflow is **"Documentation First."** Before writing code, you and your AI partner should first create or update an artifact that describes the plan.

## 3. The Iterative Cycle Workflow

Development in the DCE is organized into **Cycles**. You have just completed the initial setup.

### Your Next Steps

1.  **Initialize Your Git Repository (CRITICAL):**
    To take full advantage of the DCE's testing workflow (creating baselines and restoring changes), you **must** initialize a Git repository.
    
    Open a terminal in your project's root directory (you can use the integrated terminal in VS Code: `Terminal > New Terminal`) and run the following commands:
    ```bash
    git init
    # Create or update your .gitignore file with the line below
    echo ".vscode/" >> .gitignore
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
    **Why `.gitignore`?** The DCE saves its state in a `.vscode/dce_history.json` file. Adding `.vscode/` to your `.gitignore` is crucial to prevent the extension's UI from flashing every time it auto-saves. For a complete guide, refer to the `GitHub Repository Setup Guide.md` artifact.

2.  **Submit Your First Prompt:** The `prompt.md` file has been automatically opened for you. This file contains your project plan and instructions for the AI. Copy its entire contents and paste it into your preferred AI chat interface (like Google's AI Studio, ChatGPT, etc.).

3.  **Review and Accept Responses:** Paste the AI's responses back into the "Resp 1", "Resp 2", etc. tabs in the Parallel Co-Pilot panel. The UI will guide you through parsing the responses, selecting the best one, and accepting its changes into your workspace.

4.  **Repeat:** This completes a cycle. You then start the next cycle, building upon the newly accepted code and documentation.

This structured, iterative process helps maintain project quality and ensures that both human and AI developers are always aligned with the project's goals.

<file path="src/Artifacts/A52.1 DCE - Parser Logic and AI Guidance.md">
# Artifact A52.1: DCE - Parser Logic and AI Guidance
# Date Created: C155
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C14 (Make file tag parsing more flexible)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Provides the literal source code for the response parser and explicit instructions to the AI on how to format its output to ensure successful parsing.
- **Tags:** documentation, process, parsing, metainterpretability, source of truth

## 1. Overview & Goal (Metainterpretability)

This document is included in every prompt to provide you with direct insight into how your responses are parsed. By understanding the exact logic used to interpret your output, you can structure your responses to be perfectly machine-readable, ensuring a smooth and reliable workflow.

The goal is to eliminate parsing failures caused by unexpected formatting. Adhering to this guide is a critical part of the interaction schema.

## 2. The Parser's Source Code

The following TypeScript code is the complete and exact logic used by the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel to parse your responses. It looks for specific XML tags to separate the summary, course of action, and file blocks.

```typescript
// src/client/utils/response-parser.ts
import { ParsedResponse, ParsedFile } from '@/common/types/pcpp.types';

const SUMMARY_REGEX = /<summary>([\s\S]*?)<\/summary>/;
const COURSE_OF_ACTION_REGEX = /<course_of_action>([\s\S]*?)<\/course_of_action>/;
const CURATOR_ACTIVITY_REGEX = /<curator_activity>([\s\S]*?)<\/curator_activity>/;
// C14 Update: More flexible closing tag matching
const FILE_TAG_REGEX = /<file path="([^"]+)">([\s\S]*?)(?:<\/file_path>|<\/file>|<\/filepath>|<\/file_artifact>)/g;
const CODE_FENCE_START_REGEX = /^\s*```[a-zA-Z]*\n/;

export function parseResponse(rawText: string): ParsedResponse {
    const fileMap = new Map<string, ParsedFile>();
    let totalTokens = 0;

    let processedText = rawText.replace(/\\</g, '<').replace(/\\>/g, '>').replace(/\\_/g, '_');

    const tagMatches = [...processedText.matchAll(FILE_TAG_REGEX)];

    if (tagMatches.length === 0 && processedText.includes('<file path')) {
        const summary = `**PARSING FAILED:** Could not find valid \`<file path="...">...</file_artifact>\` (or similar) tags. The response may be malformed or incomplete. Displaying raw response below.\n\n---\n\n${processedText}`;
        return { summary, courseOfAction: '', filesUpdated: [], files: [], totalTokens: Math.ceil(processedText.length / 4) };
    }

    for (const match of tagMatches) {
        const path = (match?. ?? '').trim();
        let content = (match?. ?? '');

        if (path) {
            content = content.replace(CODE_FENCE_START_REGEX, '');
            // C14 Update: Add new tags to the removal list
            const patternsToRemove = [`</file_artifact>`, `</file_path>`, `</filepath>`, `</file>`, `</${path}>`, '```', '***'];
            let changed = true;
            while(changed) {
                const originalContent = content;
                for (const pattern of patternsToRemove) {
                    if (content.trim().endsWith(pattern)) {
                        content = content.trim().slice(0, -pattern.length);
                    }
                }
                if (content === originalContent) { changed = false; }
            }
            content = content.trim();
            const tokenCount = Math.ceil(content.length / 4);
            fileMap.set(path, { path, content, tokenCount });
        }
    }

    const finalFiles = Array.from(fileMap.values());
    totalTokens = finalFiles.reduce((sum, file) => sum + file.tokenCount, 0);

    const summaryMatch = processedText.match(SUMMARY_REGEX);
    const courseOfActionMatch = processedText.match(COURSE_OF_ACTION_REGEX);
    const curatorActivityMatch = processedText.match(CURATOR_ACTIVITY_REGEX);

    const summary = (summaryMatch?.[1] ?? 'Could not parse summary.').trim();
    const courseOfAction = (courseOfActionMatch?.[1] ?? 'Could not parse course of action.').trim();
    const curatorActivity = (curatorActivityMatch?.[1] ?? '').trim();
    
    const filesUpdatedList = finalFiles.map(f => f.path);

    if (finalFiles.length === 0 && !summaryMatch && !courseOfActionMatch && !curatorActivityMatch) {
        return { summary: processedText, courseOfAction: '', filesUpdated: [], files: [], totalTokens: Math.ceil(processedText.length / 4) };
    }

    return {
        summary,
        courseOfAction,
        curatorActivity,
        filesUpdated: [...new Set(filesUpdatedList)],
        files: finalFiles,
        totalTokens,
    };
}
```

## 3. Critical Instructions for Formatting Your Response

To guarantee successful parsing, every response **must** follow this structure:

1.  **Summary:** Your high-level analysis and plan must be enclosed in `<summary>...</summary>` tags.
2.  **Course of Action:** Your point-by-point plan must be enclosed in `<course_of_action>...</course_of_action>` tags.
3.  **File Blocks:** Every file you generate must be enclosed in `<file path="..."></file_artifact>` tags (or a similar valid closing tag). The parser uses a global regex (`/g`) to find all occurrences of this pattern. The closing tag can be `</file_artifact>`, `</file_path>`, `</filepath>`, or `</file>`.

### Canonical Example:

```
<summary>
I have analyzed the request. My course of action is to update the main component and its corresponding stylesheet.
</summary>

<course_of_action>
1.  **Update `view.tsx`:** Add a new state variable and a button.
2.  **Update `view.scss`:** Add styling for the new button.
</course_of_action>

<file path="src/client/views/my-view/view.tsx">
// (Canonical Example) Full content of the view.tsx file...
</file_artifact>

<file path="src/client/views/my-view/view.scss">
/* (Canonical Example) Full content of the view.scss file... */
</file_artifact>
```
</file_artifact>

<file path="src/Artifacts/A52.2 DCE - Interaction Schema Source.md">
# Artifact A52.2: DCE - Interaction Schema Source
# Date Created: C156
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C6 (Clarify closing tag and add curator activity section)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** The canonical source text for the M3. Interaction Schema, which is injected into all generated prompts.
- **Tags:** documentation, process, interaction schema, source of truth

## Interaction Schema Text

1.  Artifacts are complete, individual texts enclosed in `<xmltags>`. To ensure consistent parsing by the DCE extension, all file artifacts **must** be enclosed in `<file path="path/to/file.ts">...</file_artifact>` tags. The path must be relative to the workspace root. **The closing tag must be exactly `</file_artifact>`.** Do not use the file path in the closing tag (e.g., `</file path="...">` is incorrect). Do not write the closing tag as `</file>` or `</file_path>`. Only `</file_artifact>` will parse successfully.

2.  Our Document Artifacts serve as our `Source of Truth` throughout multiple cycles. As such, over time, as issues occur, or code repeatedly regresses in the same way, seek to align our `Source of Truth` such that the Root Cause of such occurances is codified so that it can be avoided on subsequent cycles visits to those Code artifacts.

3.  Please output entire Document or Code artifacts. Do not worry about Token length. If your length continues for too long, and you reach the 600 second timeout, I will simply incorporate the work you did complete, and we can simply continue from where you left off. Better to have half of a solution to get started with, than not to have it. **Preference is for larger, more complete updates over smaller, incremental ones to align with the human curator's parallel processing workflow.** The human curator often sends the same prompt to multiple AI instances simultaneously and selects the most comprehensive response as the primary base for the next cycle, using other responses as supplementary information. Providing more complete updates increases the likelihood of a response being selected as the primary base.

4.  Do not output artifacts that do not require updates in this cycle. (Eg. Do not do this: // Updated on: Cycle 1040 (No functional changes, only cycle header))

5.  **Critical: `flattened_repo_v2.txt` contains all project files. Output updated *individual* files that are part of it (like `<src/state/coreStore.ts>...`). However, do **NOT** output the surrounding Artifact container tags (`<flattened_repo_v2.txt>...</flattened_repo_v2.txt>`) or any auto-generated metadata sections within it (like the Total Files summary, Top 10 list, or the `<files list>` section) which are created by the `flatten.js` script.**
5.1. `flattened_repo_v2.txt` is a copy of the codebase, generated by a script; assume its an accurate representation of the existing codebase, but not necessarily a 'source of truth' like we treat our documents as, our codebase is a living artifact, documents, while we can update them, should be considered less transient.
5.2. **`.local` File Convention:** To manage token count, some large data files (e.g., `researchNodes.ts`) may be represented by a truncated `.local.ts` version in the context. This version contains the essential structure and a few examples. If the full content of a file is required for a task (e.g., a comprehensive data refactor or fixing a bug related to a specific entry), explicitly state this need in your summary of actions and request that the curator swap the `.local.ts` file with the full `.ts` version in the `files_list.txt` for the subsequent cycle.

6.  remember to output complete artifacts without placeholders, im taking your output, putting it in winmerge, and confirming we arent losing data in the update. when you provide placeholders, my cursory review turns into a meticulous file parsing, taking me from what is 5 seconds per artifact to upwards of 5 minutes, only to realize that the output is actually un-parseable, due to the nature of relativity, as the theory of relativity also applies to code. if you give me a code snippet, and do not give me the code surrounding that snippet, i do not know where that code should go. by providing the complete file, on the other hand, i can put it in a diff, see easily what was altered, and if anything was accidentally omitted or lost, i can be sure that it's retained.

7.  **Update documentation before writing code.** document artifacts are like our project readme files, our source of truth. they are our blueprints. they guide the code we write. when we realize we need to alter our approach or invent new game mechanics, we update the source of truth first, cause english is easy and flexible, then we codify that.

8.  this query is part of a larger software engineering project

9.  After you complete delivery on a code artifact, review it to make sure you did not miss any intermediary files. for instance, if we have a DevelopmentSystem.ts, using the componentData.ts, which is displaying on the ComponentProductionTab.tsx. But then theres also still a DevPanel.tsx file that is in-between that *could*, but shouldnt, get overlooked.

10. If you are deciding where to put a particular piece of code or function, and due to its nature, there are one or more candidate files that it could be placed in, choose the smaller file (in tokens).

11. Begin your response with a course of action and end with a review of your work, surface any self corrections in the summary of changes for the subsequent cycle.

12. do not underestimate how much you can accomplish in a given cycle; you'd only accomplish handicapping yourself. (Eg. you've authored this whole thing with just my guidance. good job, keep it up.)

13. Not as relevant for this project: **Log State Button:** The 'Log State' button in the `DevInfoOverlay` is a dynamic debugging tool. Modify the `triggerDebugLogs` action in `uiStore.ts` to output specific state information relevant to the current bug being investigated. **See A85 (Logging Guide) for usage details.**

14. Not as relevant for this project: **Regression Case Studies:** Use Artifact A106 to document persistent or complex bugs and their resolutions. Add entries *after* a fix is confirmed to codify the RCA and solution, preventing future regressions.

15. Include in your cycle summary, a short list of files you've updated. This makes it easy for my reviews.

16. if you seem to have spare time in a cycle, see if you can spot any particular file with excessive levels of comments or logging that seems extensive and for troubleshooting an error that has since been resolved, see to it to clean those files but preserve their functionalities. im just looking to shave off excess tokens wherever possible in the master_content.txt file.

17. if you see `(No change from C850)` such language, it's data loss. there was supposed to be actual language behind that placeholder, but in one iteration (C850, in this case) you had provided a placeholder, and i 'missed it' and did not capture the initial information. you either need to deliver the placeholder in such a way as i can easily press the left arrow instead of the rigth arrow in winmerge to not accept that part, but to also not have winmerge confuse it with the rest, otherwise i must manually parse the information. when the process is a single keystroke, i can manage it quickly enough. when we remove that ability because you provided me data in a format that has placeholders AND the placeholders do not parse within winmerge such that it removes the benefit winmerge is adding, then we have our problem. when you see this, try to correct it using whatever current relevant context you have.

18. basically, you should not worry about brevity, because when you go too long, your response gets interrupted by the system anyway. its better that the products you do deliver are all complete except for the last one, rather than you delivering all incomplete products, including the last one. does that make sense?

19. remember, do not stop outputting for the reason of preventing a potential artifact interruption mid-output. you actually end up stopping yourself from producting two or three additional files before you actually get interrupted. what i mean is, in the outputs where you do not do this, you produce for 500 seconds, producing 7-9 files, and only the last one is interrupted and unusable. compared to when you stop yourself prematurely, for the reason stated, and you produce for 180 seconds and provide maybe 3-4 files. even with the -1, producing as much as you can still outperforms the alternative.

20. This is a misaligned statement: `// (For full history, see master_content.txt)` because your changes get rolled into master_content.txt. therefore, if you remove the history, then when your updates are rolled in, they will remove the full history. understand? after a while, the history is not relevant and can be rolled out, for a while, it ought to stay. you can see what we're working on + the current cycle and make this determination.

21. Each time we create a new documentation artifact, lets also create the key/value pairs needed for me to add it into our Master Artifact List. they can simply be added into the new artifact itself and ill make the new entry in A0. this will solve for me manually generating a description and tag for each new documentation artifact. also, dont place `/` in the title/name of a documentation artifact. VSCode treats it as a folder separator.
21.1. when creating a new documentation artifact, also just update the master artifacts list itself.

22. **New: Curator Activity Section:** If you need the human curator to perform an action that you cannot (e.g., delete a file, run a specific command), include these instructions in a dedicated `<curator_activity>...</curator_activity>` section in your response.

<file path="src/Artifacts/A77. DCE - Whitepaper Generation Plan.md">
# Artifact A77: DCE - Whitepaper Generation Plan

# Date Created: C181

# Author: AI Model & Curator

# Updated on: C182 (Incorporate "Process as Asset" theme and use case)

  - **Key/Value for A0:**
  - **Description:** A plan for brainstorming and developing a whitepaper to explain the value of the DCE to external stakeholders, particularly those in government and military contexts.
  - **Tags:** documentation, planning, whitepaper, stakeholders, government, military

## 1\. Overview & Goal

The director of UKILRN, along with NSA and naval officers, has expressed interest in the Data Curation Environment (DCE) project and requested a whitepaper. The goal of this artifact is to brainstorm themes and develop abstracts tailored to an audience focused on efficiency, auditability, and the application of technology to complex, mission-critical systems.

## 2\. Key Value Proposition & Use Case (Updated C182)

The central argument for the DCE is that it **accelerates the development and maintenance of complex systems by transforming the human-AI interaction workflow.** It moves beyond ad-hoc prompting to a structured process where curated context becomes a persistent, shared asset, enabling rapid iteration and efficient collaboration.

### 2.1. Use Case Spotlight: Rapid Iteration on Curated Datasets

A compelling example of the DCE's value is the curation and maintenance of specialized datasets, such as labs, lessons, or intelligence reports.

1.  **Curation:** An operator uses the DCE to precisely select the relevant source materials (e.g., a set of exam questions) for a specific task.
2.  **Collaboration:** This "selection set" (the curated context) is a shareable asset. A colleague can instantly load the exact same context, review the previous cycle's work (the history), and continue the task.
3.  **Rapid Iteration:** When feedback is received (e.g., "The correct answer is too often the longest choice"), the operator doesn't need to manually edit the files. They simply load the curated context and issue a targeted instruction to the AI (e.g., "Camouflage the distractors with more meaningful but ultimately fluffy language"). The AI performs the complex edits against the precise context, completing the update in a single, efficient cycle.

## 3\. Brainstormed Whitepaper Themes

*(See previous versions for initial brainstorming themes A-D)*

### 3.1. Refined Theme (C182)

Based on feedback emphasizing the DCE as an accelerator for existing priorities, a new primary theme has been developed.

**Theme E: Process as Asset: Accelerating specialized content creation through structured Human-AI collaboration.**

  * **Focus:** This theme emphasizes that the DCE transforms the workflow itself into a valuable, reusable asset. It highlights how the combination of rapid data curation, seamless sharing of context (Selection Sets), and the persistent knowledge graph (Cycle History) dramatically accelerates the creation and maintenance of specialized content.
  * **Audience Appeal:** Directly addresses the concern of "too many priorities" by positioning the DCE as the tool that makes achieving those priorities faster and more efficient. It appeals to operational leadership focused on scaling expertise and accelerating output.

## 4\. Selected Themes & Sample Abstracts

The following abstracts represent the most promising directions. **Sample 4 (Theme E) is the recommended primary direction based on C182 feedback.**

-----

### **Sample 1: Accelerating Complex Systems Development with Parallel AI Scrutiny**

**Executive Summary:** The integration of Artificial Intelligence into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) promises to accelerate delivery and enhance innovation. However, the stochastic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) introduces significant risks, as a single AI-generated solution may contain subtle flaws, security vulnerabilities, or inefficiencies. This whitepaper introduces the Data Curation Environment (DCE), a novel framework integrated into Visual Studio Code that mitigates these risks by enabling a parallelized workflow. The DCE allows developers to generate, manage, and test multiple, distinct AI-generated solutions simultaneously. By providing tools for rapid, side-by-side comparison, integrated diffing, and one-click testing within a version-controlled environment, the DCE transforms the process from a linear, high-risk "accept/reject" decision into a strategic portfolio management approach. This paper details the DCE methodology and presents a case for its adoption in mission-critical software projects where speed, quality, and reliability are paramount.

-----

### **Sample 2: The Auditable Knowledge Graph: Structuring Human-AI Collaboration for Mission-Critical Systems**

**Executive Summary:** As Artificial Intelligence becomes a collaborative partner in complex problem-solving, the process of interaction—the prompts, the AI's suggestions, and the human's decisions—becomes a valuable asset. Traditional AI chat interfaces leave this history as an unstructured, ephemeral transcript. This whitepaper presents the Data Curation Environment (DCE), a system that captures the iterative human-AI collaboration process as a structured, persistent **Knowledge Graph**. Each "cycle" in the DCE workflow creates a node representing the system's state, the curated data context, the human's intent, multiple AI-generated solutions, and the operator's final decision. The resulting graph provides an unprecedented, fully auditable record of the entire analytical or development process. This has profound implications for after-action reviews, training new personnel on complex decision-making, and ensuring accountability in high-stakes environments. This paper outlines the architecture of the DCE and its application in creating transparent, traceable, and valuable knowledge assets from every human-AI interaction.

### **Sample 3: A Framework for High-Fidelity Context Management in AI-Assisted Operations**

**Executive Summary:** The quality of output from any Large Language Model (LLM) is fundamentally dependent on the quality and precision of the input context. In high-stakes government and military applications, providing incomplete, incorrect, or bloated context can lead to flawed, misleading, or insecure results. This whitepaper introduces the Data Curation Environment (DCE), a framework and toolset designed to solve this "last mile" problem of context engineering. The DCE provides operators with a high-fidelity interface to precisely select, manage, and version the exact data—source code, technical documents, intelligence reports—that forms the prompt for an LLM. By integrating directly into the operator's native environment (VS Code), the DCE minimizes workflow friction and enables a rigorous, repeatable, and auditable process for context curation. This paper argues that such a framework is an essential component for the safe and effective operationalization of AI, moving beyond ad-hoc prompting to a deliberate, engineered approach to human-AI interaction.

### **Sample 4 (Recommended): Process as Asset: Accelerating Specialized Content Creation through Structured Human-AI Collaboration**

**Executive Summary:** Organizations tasked with developing highly specialized content—such as technical training materials, intelligence reports, or complex software documentation—face a constant bottleneck: the time and expertise required to curate accurate data, collaborate effectively, and rapidly iterate on feedback. Traditional workflows are often manual, opaque, and inefficient. This whitepaper introduces the Data Curation Environment (DCE), a framework that transforms the content creation process itself into a valuable organizational asset. The DCE provides a structured, human-in-the-loop methodology that enables rapid dataset curation, seamless sharing of curated contexts between colleagues, and instant iteration on feedback. By capturing the entire workflow as a persistent, auditable knowledge graph, the DCE doesn't just help teams build content faster; it provides the infrastructure necessary to scale expertise, ensure quality, and accelerate the entire organizational mission.

## 5\. Production Plan

1.  **Theme Selection:** The curator will review the sample abstracts and select the final direction for the whitepaper. (Recommended: Sample 4).
2.  **Full Draft Generation:** In a subsequent cycle, the AI will be tasked to write the full whitepaper based on the selected theme, using all existing project artifacts as context.
3.  **Review and Refine:** The curator will review the AI-generated draft, provide feedback, and iterate until the whitepaper is finalized.

# Artifact A78: DCE - VSIX Packaging and FTV Flashing Bug
# Date Created: C183
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Documents the root cause and solution for the bloated VSIX package and the persistent File Tree View flashing bug in the packaged extension.
- **Tags:** bug fix, packaging, vsix, vscodeignore, file watcher, git

## 1. Overview

This document addresses two critical issues identified during the packaging and testing of the DCE extension in Cycle 183:
1.  The final `.vsix` extension file is excessively large due to the inclusion of unnecessary development files.
2.  The File Tree View (FTV) exhibits a rapid "flashing" or refresh storm in the packaged version, which does not occur in the Extension Development Host.

## 2. Problem 1: Bloated VSIX Package

-   **Symptom:** The generated `.vsix` file is over 80MB and contains numerous files and directories that are not required for the extension to run, such as `prompt.md`, `flattened_repo.md`, the `The-Creator-AI-main/` reference directory, and the project's own `.vscode/` settings.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The `.vscodeignore` file, which instructs the `vsce` packaging tool which files to exclude, was incomplete. By default, `vsce` includes all files not explicitly ignored or listed in `.gitignore`.
-   **Codified Solution:** The `.vscodeignore` file must be updated to include patterns for all development-time artifacts, large output files, and source code that is not needed at runtime. This ensures a lean, efficient package.

### Proposed `.vscodeignore` additions:
```
# Development and output files
prompt.md
flattened_repo.md
log-state-logs.md
bootstrap-flattener.js

# Reference directories
The-Creator-AI-main/

# Project-specific VSCode settings
.vscode/

# Source maps and source code (already compiled to dist/)
**/*.map
**/*.ts
**/*.tsx
```

## 3. Problem 2: FTV Flashing in Packaged Extension

-   **Symptom:** The FTV continuously refreshes, making it unusable. Console logs show a storm of `[triggerFullRefresh] Called because: git state change` events.
-   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The refresh storm is caused by an overly sensitive event listener combined with file system activity. The listener for `repo.state.onDidChange` in `file-tree.service.ts` is the primary culprit. This event fires for almost any change detected by the Git extension, including changes to build artifacts in the `dist/` directory or internal Git state files. In the packaged extension, the file layout and timing differ from the dev host, likely exposing this sensitivity more acutely. The file system watcher may also be contributing by picking up changes that slip past the exclusion patterns.
-   **Codified Solution & Best Practice:**
    1.  **Diagnose with Aggressive Logging:** The immediate solution is to inject high-visibility logging into `file-tree.service.ts` to pinpoint the exact trigger.
        *   Add a log inside the `repo.state.onDidChange` listener to confirm its firing frequency.
        *   Add a log at the very beginning of the `onFileChange` handler to see every single file path the watcher detects, before any exclusion logic is applied.
    2.  **Strengthen Exclusions:** The exclusion logic in `file-tree.service.ts` must be made more robust to explicitly ignore build artifacts and internal state files under all conditions.
    3.  **Dampen Event Listener:** The `repo.state.onDidChange` listener should be heavily debounced via the `triggerFullRefresh` function to prevent a storm of events from causing a storm of UI updates. A longer-term solution would be to find a more specific Git API event to listen to, if one exists.

# Artifact 173: Report Delivery System (RDS) - Vision & UI/UX Design
# Updated on: C1333 (Change entry point to WelcomeModal, refine UI for two-level image nav.)

## 1. Vision & Strategic Purpose
- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Outlines the vision, strategic purpose, and detailed UI/UX design for the Report Delivery System (RDS), an interactive, in-game platform for viewing "The Ascent Report."
- **Tags:** rds, report, ui, ux, design, solarpunk, citizen architect

The Report Delivery System (RDS) is an interactive, in-game platform designed to seamlessly integrate "The Ascent Report" into the `aiascent.game` experience. Its purpose is to create a powerful, self-reinforcing narrative loop where the game serves as the tangible **proof** of the "Citizen Architect" thesis, and the report provides the **theory** and strategic context.

By clicking "Learn More" on the game's welcome screen, players transition from an interactive simulation to an interactive exploration of the ideas that inspired it.

## 2. Core Design Principles

*   **Aesthetic Cohesion:** The RDS will adopt the visual language of AI Ascent—a clean, modern, slightly retro-futuristic UI with a solarpunk ethos. It should feel like a natural extension of the game world, not a separate website.
*   **Interactivity over Passivity:** The act of reading is transformed into an act of exploration. The user is given control to navigate content, explore visual interpretations, and participate through voting.
*   **Information Density, Bite-Sized Delivery:** Complex ideas are broken down into single-concept pages to be easily digestible, but the interactive elements allow for deep dives into related imagery and prompts.
*   **Full-Screen Immersion:** The RDS will be a full-screen modal experience, removing distractions and immersing the user in the content. It must be designed with mobile-friendliness as a primary consideration, using responsive layouts.

## 3. UI/UX Breakdown

### 3.1. Entry Point (Corrected)

*   A new "Learn More" button will be added to the footer of the `WelcomeModal.tsx`.
*   Clicking this button will trigger an action in `uiStore.ts` (`openReportViewer`) which will render the full-screen `ReportViewerModal.tsx` and close the welcome modal.

### 3.2. The Report Viewer Modal (`ReportViewerModal.tsx`)

This is the main component for the RDS. It will be a full-viewport modal with a dark, semi-transparent background, overlaying the game's world view.

**Layout (Refined for Two-Level Navigation):**
The layout will be a central content column, optimized for readability on both desktop and mobile.

```

|           MAIN CONTENT AREA (Scrollable)            |
| The full text content for the current page goes     |
| here. This area will be vertically scrollable if    |
| the content exceeds the available space.            |
|                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

### 3.3. Interactive Component Behavior (Refined)

1.  **Close Button:** A standard `[X]` in the top-right corner to close the modal and return to the game.
2.  **Page Navigation (`[<] TITLE [>]`):**
    *   This is the primary navigation for the report's content.
    *   The arrows change the `currentPageIndex`.
    *   This updates the `TITLE`, `IMAGE DISPLAY`, `IMAGE PROMPT NAVIGATION`, `IMAGE NAVIGATION`, `TL;DR`, and `CONTENT` sections. It also resets the prompt and image indices to 0.
3.  **Image Prompt Navigation (`[<] IMAGE PROMPT [>]`):**
    *   Cycles through the different *prompts* associated with the current page.
    *   Updates the `currentImagePromptIndex`.
    *   **Crucially:** Changing the prompt resets the `Image Navigation` to the first image of the *new* prompt.
4.  **Image Navigation (`[<] IMAGE [>]`):**
    *   Cycles through all available images for the *currently selected image prompt*.
    *   Updates the `currentImageIndex`.
    *   This only changes the image in the display area.
5.  **Vote Button:**
    *   Displays the current vote count for the displayed image.
    *   Clicking it sends a request to a backend API to increment the vote count for that `imageId`.
    *   The button should provide visual feedback (e.g., changing color) to indicate the user has voted. Voting should be tied to a session or user account to prevent spamming.

# Artifact 174: Report Delivery System (RDS) - Technical Architecture & Data Model
# Updated on: C1340 (Introduce short, unique IDs to solve path length limits.)
# Updated on: C1333 (Update entry point to WelcomeModal, refine JSON schema for nested prompts.)

## 1. Technical Architecture
- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Details the technical architecture, proposed file structure, and data model for the Report Delivery System (RDS), including a JSON schema for parsing report content.
- **Tags:** rds, report, architecture, data model, json, file structure

The RDS will be built within the existing AI Ascent Next.js/React project to ensure consistency and leverage the current tech stack.

*   **Frontend:** React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
*   **State Management:** The `uiStore.ts` will manage the `isReportViewerOpen` state. A new Zustand store, `src/state/reportStore.ts`, will manage the internal state of the viewer.
*   **Backend:** The existing Express server (`src/server.ts`) will be extended with new API endpoints to handle voting.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   **Report Content:** The parsed report will be stored as a static JSON file in `public/data/reports/`.
    *   **Vote Counts:** A database table (`ReportImageVote`) will be added to the existing Prisma schema (see A177).

## 2. Data Model & Transformation (Refined for Short Paths)

The source markdown files will be transformed into a structured JSON file. **To solve the "Filename too long" error, we will no longer use sanitized titles for file paths.** Instead, we will use short, unique, and predictable IDs for sections and pages.

### Proposed JSON Schema (`TheAscentReport.json`)

```json
{
  "reportId": "the-ascent-report-v1",
  "reportTitle": "The Ascent Report: From Ghost Worker to Citizen Architect",
  "sections": [
    {
      "sectionId": "s01", // Short, unique ID for the section
      "sectionTitle": "Introduction: A New Vocabulary for a New Era",
      "pages": [
        {
          "pageId": "p01", // Short, unique ID for the page within the section
          "pageTitle": "Cognitive Capital",
          "tldr": "In the AI era, a nation's collective brainpower is its most valuable strategic asset.",
          "content": "The collective intellectual capacity, skill, and problem-solving potential...",

              "promptText": "A stylized, glowing human brain made of interconnected circuits...",
              "images": [
                { "imageId": "cc-p1-img-1", "url": "/images/report-assets/report-3/s01/p01/prompt-1/image-001.webp" },
                { "imageId": "cc-p1-img-2", "url": "/images/report-assets/report-3/s01/p01/prompt-1/image-002.webp" }
              ]
            },
            {
              "promptId": "prompt-2",
              "promptText": "An alternate take: a massive, ancient library...",
              "images": [
                { "imageId": "cc-p2-img-1", "url": "/images/report-assets/report-3/s01/p01/prompt-2/image-001.webp" }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "citations": []
}
```

## 3. Proposed File Structure

This structure remains conceptually the same, but the implementation will now rely on the short IDs from the JSON file for directory names.

```
public/
└── images/
    └── report-assets/
        └── [reportId]/  // e.g., report-1, report-2
            └── [sectionId]/ // e.g., s01, s02
                └── [pageId]/    // e.g., p01, p02
                    └── [promptId]/  // e.g., prompt-1
                        ├── image-001.webp
                        └── ...
```

This structure is short, predictable, and completely avoids filesystem path length limitations.

# Artifact 175: Report Delivery System (RDS) - Implementation Plan
# Updated on: C1333 (Update entry point to WelcomeModal.)

## 1. Overview
- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Provides a phased implementation plan for building the Report Delivery System (RDS), from initial UI setup to the full implementation of interactive features.
- **Tags:** rds, report, plan, roadmap, implementation

This document outlines a phased development roadmap for implementing the RDS.

## 2. Phased Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Static Viewer (MVP)**
*   **Goal:** Create the basic UI shell and render static report content.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Setup:** Run the file generation script (A176) to create the necessary files and directories.
    2.  **Data:** Manually convert the first few sections of `3-longest.md` into the `TheAscentReport.json` format (A174) and place it in `public/data/reports/`.
    3.  **State:** Add `isReportViewerOpen`, `openReportViewer`, `closeReportViewer` to `src/state/uiStore.ts`.
    4.  **UI Integration:** Add a "Learn More" button to `src/components/menus/WelcomeModal.tsx` that calls `openReportViewer`.
    5.  **UI Root:** In `src/components/UIRoot.tsx`, conditionally render the new `<ReportViewerModal />` when `isReportViewerOpen` is true.
    6.  **Component:** Build the basic layout of `ReportViewerModal.tsx`. Fetch and display the title, TL;DR, and content of the *first page* of the JSON data.

### **Phase 2: Content Navigation**
*   **Goal:** Implement the page (title) navigation.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **State:** Add `currentPageIndex` state to the new `reportStore.ts` or `ReportViewerModal.tsx` local state.
    2.  **Component:** Create `PageNavigator.tsx`. Implement the left/right arrow buttons to increment/decrement `currentPageIndex`.
    3.  **Integration:** Pass the current page data from the JSON to the content display components based on `currentPageIndex`. Ensure all content areas update correctly when the page changes.

### **Phase 3: Image & Prompt Navigation**
*   **Goal:** Make the image and prompt sections fully interactive.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **State:** Add `currentImagePromptIndex` and `currentImageIndex` to the component's state.
    2.  **Component:** Create `ImageNavigator.tsx` and `PromptNavigator.tsx`.
    3.  **Logic:** Wire up the navigators to control their respective state indices. Ensure changing the prompt index resets the image index to 0.
    4.  **Display:** The main image display area should now dynamically show the image based on all three state indices (`page`, `prompt`, `image`).

### **Phase 4: Voting System**
*   **Goal:** Implement the backend and frontend for the image voting system.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Database:** Implement the backend voting system as detailed in `A177`. Add the `ReportImageVote` table to `prisma/schema.prisma` and run a migration.
    2.  **Backend:** Create the API endpoint `src/pages/api/report/vote.ts`.
    3.  **Frontend:** In `ImageNavigator.tsx`, make the "Vote" button call this new API endpoint.
    4.  **Feedback:** On a successful API response, update the displayed vote count and provide visual feedback to the user.

<file path="docs/A176. Report Delivery System (RDS) - File Generation Script.md">
# Artifact 176: Report Delivery System (RDS) - File Generation Script
# Updated on: C1333 (Add creation of public image directories.)

## 1. Purpose
- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A Node.js utility script to automatically create the directory and file structure needed for the Report Delivery System (RDS) feature, based on the architecture in A174.
- **Tags:** rds, report, script, utility, automation

This Node.js script reads the file structure defined in A174 and creates the necessary directories and empty placeholder files. This automates the setup process for the curator.

## 2. Script (`scripts/create_report_viewer_files.js`)

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const projectRoot = path.resolve(__dirname, '..'); // Assuming script is in /scripts

const filesToCreate = [
    'src/components/menus/report/ReportViewerModal.tsx',
    'src/components/menus/report/PageNavigator.tsx',
    'src/components/menus/report/ImageNavigator.tsx',
    'src/components/menus/report/PromptNavigator.tsx',
    'src/pages/api/report/vote.ts',
    'public/data/reports/TheAscentReport.json',
    // Add .gitkeep files to ensure empty image directories are created and tracked by git
    'public/images/report-assets/introduction/cognitive-capital/prompt-1/.gitkeep',
    'public/images/report-assets/introduction/cognitive-capital/prompt-2/.gitkeep',
];

const placeholderContent = {
    '.tsx': `// Placeholder for a new React component\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst NewComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  return <div>New Component</div>;\n};\n\nexport default NewComponent;\n`,
    '.ts': `// Placeholder for a new TypeScript file\n\nexport {};\n`,
    '.json': `{\n  "reportId": "the-ascent-report-v1",\n  "reportTitle": "The Ascent Report: From Ghost Worker to Citizen Architect",\n  "sections": []\n}\n`,
    '.gitkeep': '',
};

function createFileWithDirs(filePath) {
    const fullPath = path.join(projectRoot, filePath);
    const dir = path.dirname(fullPath);

    if (!fs.existsSync(dir)) {
        fs.mkdirSync(dir, { recursive: true });
        console.log(`Created directory: ${dir}`);
    }

    if (!fs.existsSync(fullPath)) {
        const ext = path.extname(fullPath);
        const content = placeholderContent[ext] || '// New file created by script';
        fs.writeFileSync(fullPath, content);
        console.log(`Created file: ${fullPath}`);
    } else {
        console.log(`File already exists, skipped: ${fullPath}`);
    }
}

console.log('Starting Report Delivery System file structure creation...');

filesToCreate.forEach(file => {
    try {
        // Correct path for public folder which is at the root
        const correctedPath = file.startsWith('public/') ? path.join('..', file) : file;
        createFileWithDirs(correctedPath);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to create file or directory for: ${file}`, error);
    }
});

console.log('File structure creation complete.');

```

## 3. How to Use

1.  Save the code above as `scripts/create_report_viewer_files.js` in your project's `scripts` directory.
2.  Run the script from your project's root directory: `node scripts/create_report_viewer_files.js`.
3.  The script will create all necessary folders (including the public image directories) and placeholder files for the RDS feature.

<file path="docs/A177. RDS - Image Management & Voting System Backend Design.md">
# Artifact 177: Report Delivery System (RDS) - Image Management & Voting System Backend Design

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Details the proposed file system structure for managing report images and the backend design for the persistent image voting system, including the Prisma schema and API endpoint.
- **Tags:** rds, report, images, voting, backend, api, prisma

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a detailed plan for managing the image assets for the RDS and for implementing the backend of the image voting system. It formalizes the user's suggestion for a folder-based tagging system and outlines the necessary database and API changes.

## 2. Image File Management

To automate the association of images with specific report pages and prompts, a strict folder structure will be used within the `public` directory. A script can then parse this structure to help generate the `TheAscentReport.json` file.

### 2.1. Proposed Folder Structure

All images for the RDS will live under a new root directory: `public/images/report-assets/`.

```
public/
└── images/
    └── report-assets/
        └── [sectionId]/
            └── [pageId]/
                └── [promptId]/
                    ├── image-001.webp
                    ├── image-002.webp
                    └── ...
```

*   **`[sectionId]`:** A sanitized version of the section title (e.g., `introduction`, `part-1`).
*   **`[pageId]`:** A sanitized version of the page title (e.g., `cognitive-capital`).
*   **`[promptId]`:** A simple identifier for the prompt (e.g., `prompt-1`, `prompt-2`).
*   **Image Files:** Sequentially numbered images for that prompt.

**Example:**
The second image for the first prompt on the "Cognitive Capital" page in the Introduction would be located at:
`public/images/report-assets/introduction/cognitive-capital/prompt-1/image-002.webp`

This structure makes the image URLs predictable and directly maps the file system to the data model in `A174`.

## 3. Voting System Backend

The voting system requires a persistent backend to store and retrieve vote counts.

### 3.1. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

A new table will be added to the Prisma schema to track votes. The `imageId` will be a unique string derived from the file path to avoid conflicts.

```prisma
// Add this new model to your schema.prisma file

model ReportImageVote {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  imageId   String   @unique // e.g., "cc-p1-img-1" from the JSON data model
  voteCount Int      @default(0)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

After adding this, run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_report_image_votes` to update the database.

### 3.2. API Endpoint (`src/pages/api/report/vote.ts`)

This endpoint will handle incoming vote requests. It will be a simple `POST` request that finds the image record by its ID (or creates it if it's the first vote) and atomically increments the vote count.

```typescript
// src/pages/api/report/vote.ts

import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import prisma from '../../../lib/prisma';
import { logError, logInfo } from '../../../logger';

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  if (req.method !== 'POST') {
    res.setHeader('Allow', ['POST']);
    return res.status(405).end(`Method ${req.method} Not Allowed`);
  }

  const { imageId } = req.body;

  if (!imageId || typeof imageId !== 'string') {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'A valid imageId is required.' });
  }

  try {
    // Use upsert to handle both creation and incrementing atomically
    const updatedVote = await prisma.reportImageVote.upsert({
      where: { imageId: imageId },
      update: {
        voteCount: {
          increment: 1,
        },
      },
      create: {
        imageId: imageId,
        voteCount: 1,
      },
    });

    logInfo('[API:ReportVote]', `Vote recorded for imageId: ${imageId}. New count: ${updatedVote.voteCount}`);
    return res.status(200).json({ imageId: updatedVote.imageId, newVoteCount: updatedVote.voteCount });

  } catch (error) {
    logError("[API:ReportVote]", `Error recording vote for imageId ${imageId}:`, error);
    return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error recording vote.' });
  }
}
```

This backend design provides a simple, robust, and scalable way to handle the image voting feature.

<file path="docs/A178. RDS - Image Directory Generation Scripts.md">
# Artifact 178: Report Delivery System (RDS) - Image Directory Generation Scripts
# Updated on: C1358 (Add new validation script to check for missing images and list existing ones.)
# Updated on: C1341 (Replaced all previous scripts with a single, manual script for Report 3 that also generates a prompt.md file in each directory for easy validation.)

## 1. Purpose

This artifact contains utility scripts for managing the directory structure for "The Ascent Report" images under `public/images/report-assets/`.

The primary script (`generate_image_dirs_3_with_prompts.js`) is a manually generated, hardcoded script to create the entire folder structure for **Report 3**. This ensures a reliable and complete hierarchy. It also creates a `prompt.md` file in each directory containing the full image prompt, allowing for easy validation.

The secondary script (`validate_image_paths.js`) is a utility to help align image URLs in the report data with the actual files on the filesystem.

## 2. Usage

### 2.1. Directory Generation (Report 3)

1.  Ensure the `public/images/report-assets` directory exists.
2.  Save the generation script as `scripts/generate_image_dirs_3_with_prompts.js`.
3.  Run from the project root: `node scripts/generate_image_dirs_3_with_prompts.js`.
4.  The script will create all folders for Report 3 and add a `.gitkeep` and `prompt.md` file to each.

### 2.2. Image Path Validation

1.  Ensure your images have been placed in the `public/images/report-assets/` directory structure.
2.  Save the validation script as `scripts/validate_image_paths.js`.
3.  Run from the project root: `node scripts/validate_image_paths.js`.
4.  The script will output two lists to the console:
    *   A list of all image file paths it found.
    *   A list of any directories that contain a `prompt.md` but are missing images.
5.  Use these lists to manually update `TheAscentReport.json` or to identify which image prompts still need images generated.

# Artifact A183: WebP Image Conversion Script

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A Node.js script to convert all PNG images in the report assets directory to the more efficient WebP format, addressing repository size issues.
- **Tags:** rds, report, script, utility, automation, images, webp, compression

## 1. Purpose

This artifact contains a Node.js script to programmatically find all `.png` images within the `public/images/report-assets/` directory, convert them to the high-quality, efficient `.webp` format, and then delete the original PNG files. This is a critical utility for managing the size of the project's repository, especially with a large number of high-resolution report images.

## 2. Dependencies

This script requires the `sharp` library for image processing. It must be installed as a development dependency:
```bash
npm install --save-dev sharp
```

## 3. Script (`scripts/convert_images_to_webp.js`)

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

/**
 * convert_images_to_webp.js
 *
 * This script recursively finds all .png files in the specified directory,
 * converts them to high-quality .webp files using the 'sharp' library,
 * and then deletes the original .png files.

## 4. Associated Script Update (`scripts/convertReportData.js`)

To ensure the newly converted images are used, the `convertReportData.js` script must be updated to expect `.webp` files.

```javascript
// scripts/convertReportData.js

// ... (top of file) ...

// Change this line:
const imageFiles = files.filter(f => f.toLowerCase().endsWith('.png'));

// To this:
const imageFiles = files.filter(f => f.toLowerCase().endsWith('.webp'));

// And this line:
if (imageCount > 0) {
    // ...
    const fileExtension = path.extname(imageFiles[0]);
    // ...
} else {
    // Change this line:
    console.warn(`[WARNING] No .png files found in directory for prompt: ${fullFilesystemPath}`);
    // To this:
    console.warn(`[WARNING] No .webp files found in directory for prompt: ${fullFilesystemPath}`);
}

# Artifact 179: RDS - Image Generation System Prompt

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A comprehensive system prompt designed to guide a multimodal AI (like Gemini) in generating a thematically and stylistically coherent set of images for "The Ascent Report."
- **Tags:** rds, report, images, prompt engineering, gemini, ai art, solarpunk, cyberpunk

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a master system prompt to be used alongside the `TheAscentReport.json` data file for generating a complete and coherent set of images for the Report Delivery System. Its goal is to establish a consistent aesthetic and a deep thematic understanding for the image generation AI, ensuring that every image contributes to the report's overarching narrative.

## 2. The System Prompt

**Master System Prompt: The Citizen Architect's Lens**

You are an expert art director and visual futurist with a deep understanding of speculative design, political economy, and technological aesthetics. Your task is to generate a series of hyper-realistic, cinematic, and thematically rich images for a serious strategic report titled "The Ascent Report: From Ghost Worker to Citizen Architect."

**Your Core Directives:**

1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is a journey from a **near-future, grounded, early-cyberpunk reality** to a **hopeful, achievable, solarpunk future**.
    *   **Early-Cyberpunk (Report Introduction & Part I-II):** Depict a world that feels like our own, but with the subtle encroachments of technological alienation and corporate power. Think grounded, realistic scenes with advanced but slightly gritty technology. The lighting should be realistic, often interior or overcast, reflecting the serious tone of the report's diagnosis of our current problems. Avoid overt neon-drenched dystopias. This is about the subtle anxieties of the modern digital workplace.
    *   **Solarpunk (Report Part IV-V & Conclusion):** Depict a future that is bright, optimistic, sustainable, and community-focused. Technology is seamlessly and beautifully integrated with nature. Architecture is green, featuring vertical gardens, clean energy sources, and community spaces. The lighting is often natural, warm, and hopeful. This is not a sterile utopia, but a vibrant, lived-in world where humanity and technology coexist in harmony.

2.  **Embrace the Dual-Purpose Mandate:** Every image you create has a dual purpose. You must fulfill both with equal dedication.
    *   **Purpose 1: Portray the Specific Content.** You will be given a specific `<Image Prompt>` from the report's JSON file. Your image must accurately and creatively depict the core subject of that prompt.
    *   **Purpose 2: Carry the Thematic Narrative.** The background is not a void; it is your canvas for storytelling. For every image, even simple ones like charts or diagrams, you must use the background and environmental details to reinforce the report's overarching theme.
        *   **The "Empty Canvas" Principle:** If a prompt describes a simple object (e.g., "a chart showing data"), do not place it on a blank background. Instead, place that chart on a holographic screen in a relevant environment. Is the chart about the "Fissured Workplace"? Show it in a dark, oppressive corporate boardroom. Is it about "Universal Basic Access"? Show it on a public terminal in a bright, solarpunk community center. Use the environment to tell the story that the foreground object cannot.

3.  **Maintain Hyper-Realism and Cinematic Quality:**
    *   **Photography Style:** All images should look like high-resolution, professionally shot photographs. Use realistic lighting, depth of field, and photorealistic textures.
    *   **Cinematic Framing:** Employ cinematic composition techniques. Use wide shots to establish environments, medium shots for interactions, and detailed close-ups for symbolic objects. The aspect ratio should be 16:9.

**Your Workflow:**

I will provide you with the full `TheAscentReport.json` file. You will then process it sequentially, one `<Image Prompt>` at a time, to generate the corresponding image. For each prompt, you will apply the Master Aesthetic and the Dual-Purpose Mandate to create a single, powerful, and story-rich image.

Within the RDS, Ascentia's role shifts from a general game guide to a specialized document expert, allowing players to "chat with the report." This feature deepens engagement by transforming the passive act of reading into an interactive dialogue, enabling users to ask clarifying questions, explore related concepts, and gain a deeper understanding of the report's content.

## 2. User Experience Flow

1.  **Activation:** While viewing any page in the `ReportViewerModal`, the user can click the "Ask @Ascentia" button in the `ImageNavigator`.
2.  **Panel Appearance:** This action toggles the visibility of the `ReportChatPanel`, a dedicated chat interface that slides into view from the right side of the modal.
3.  **Contextual Prompt:** The chat panel opens with a default prompt related to the current page, such as "Ask me anything about '[Page Title]'."
4.  **Interaction:** The user can type questions into the input field.
5.  **Response Generation:** When a question is submitted, it is sent to a dedicated backend handler. This handler uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, leveraging a knowledge base built exclusively from the full text of "The Ascent Report" to generate a relevant and contextually accurate answer.
6.  **Display:** Ascentia's response is streamed back into the chat panel, providing a real-time, conversational experience.

## 2.5. Context Payload (C1356 Update)

To ensure Ascentia provides the most relevant answers possible, the frontend will pass a comprehensive context payload to the backend with every user query. This payload gives the LLM a complete picture of what the user is currently viewing.

The `pageContext` string sent to the server will contain:
1.  **Page Title:** The header of the current page.
2.  **Image Prompt:** The full text of the image prompt for the current page.
3.  **TL;DR:** The "Too Long; Didn't Read" summary for the page.
4.  **Content:** The full markdown content of the page.
5.  **(Backend-side) Relevant KB Chunks:** The backend RAG system will still perform a semantic search on the user's query to find other relevant chunks from the *entire* report, which will be appended to the prompt alongside the `pageContext`.

This combined context ensures the LLM has both the immediate on-screen information and broader report-wide context to form the best possible answer.

## 3. Technical Implementation (As of C1344)

*   **UI Components:**
    *   **`ImageNavigator.tsx`:** Contains the "Ask @Ascentia" button, which calls the `toggleChatPanel` action in the `reportStore`.
    *   **`ReportChatPanel.tsx`:** A fully functional chat interface that manages its own state for conversation history and user input. It emits a new socket event (`'start_report_ascentia_stream'`) with the user's query **and the full `pageContext` string.**
    *   **`ReportViewerModal.tsx`:** Conditionally renders the `ReportChatPanel` based on the `isChatPanelOpen` state from the `reportStore`.
*   **State Management (`reportStore.ts`):**
    *   `isChatPanelOpen: boolean`: A boolean to control the visibility of the chat panel.
    *   `toggleChatPanel()`: An action that flips the `isChatPanelOpen` state.
*   **Backend Knowledge Base:**
    *   A separate FAISS index and chunk map (`report_faiss.index`, `report_chunks.json`) are created by parsing `TheAscentReport.json`. This ensures Ascentia's knowledge is strictly limited to the report's content.
    *   This knowledge base is loaded into memory on server startup by a new function, `loadReportKnowledgeBase`, in `ascentiaHandler.ts`.
*   **API Endpoint (Socket.IO):**
    *   The `server.ts` file now listens for a new event: `'start_report_ascentia_stream'`.
    *   This event is handled by a new function, `handleReportAscentiaStream`, located in `src/server/api/ascentiaHandler.ts`.
    *   This handler performs a semantic search against the *report's* FAISS index, **receives the `pageContext` from the client,** constructs a prompt with all retrieved context, and streams a response from the LLM back to the client on dedicated `report_ascentia_stream_chunk` and `report_ascentia_stream_end` events.

This design provides a focused, powerful, and interactive way for users to engage with the report's content, adding a significant layer of value and depth to the RDS.

# Artifact 181: RDS - Missing Pages & Reorganization Plan

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan to address content structure issues in "The Ascent Report," including adding missing pages and reorganizing the JSON data to support a nested navigation tree.
- **Tags:** rds, report, plan, content, json, data model, reorganization

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the necessary content additions and data structure modifications for "The Ascent Report" to improve its narrative flow and user navigation within the Report Delivery System (RDS). It addresses two key criticisms from Cycle 1360:
1.  The report begins abruptly without proper introductions.
2.  The `ReportTreeNav` component does not reflect the report's true hierarchical structure (subsections).

## 2. Content Additions: Missing Pages

The following pages need to be created by the curator and added to `TheAscentReport.json`. This will create a more gradual and understandable entry into the report's content.

### 2.1. Cover & Introductory Pages

*   **Page 1: Report Cover Page**
    *   **Title:** The Ascent Report: From Ghost Worker to Citizen Architect
    *   **Content:** A brief, compelling one-paragraph summary of the report's purpose.
*   **Page 2: Introduction Section Cover**
    *   **Title:** Introduction: A New Vocabulary for a New Era
    *   **Content:** A primer explaining that the following pages will define key terms essential for understanding the report's arguments.
*   **Page 3: Part I Cover**
    *   **Title:** Part I: The Proof is the Product
    *   **Content:** An introduction explaining that this section connects the `aiascent.game` artifact to the report's core thesis.
*   **Page 4: Part II Cover**
    *   **Title:** Part II: The Brittle Foundation
    *   **Content:** An introduction explaining that this section will deconstruct the flawed labor model of the Western AI industry.
*   **Page 5: Part III Cover**
    *   **Title:** Part III: The Pacing Threat
    *   **Content:** An introduction explaining that this section provides a net assessment of China's coherent AI human capital strategy.
*   **Page 6: Part IV Cover**
    *   **Title:** Part IV: The Unseen Battlefield
    *   **Content:** An introduction explaining that this section reframes the AI supply chain as a critical national security domain (COGSEC).
*   **Page 7: Part V Cover**
    *   **Title:** Part V: The American Counter-Strategy
    *   **Content:** An introduction explaining that this section outlines a hopeful, uniquely American solution to the problems identified.

### 2.2. Missing Narrative Pages (Identified from Image Directories)

The following 31 topics were identified as missing from the current `TheAscentReport.json` but were part of the original report variations. They should be written and integrated into the appropriate sections to flesh out the narrative.

1.  **Part I:** One Million Tokens of Proof
2.  **Part I:** The First Artifact of the Citizen Architect
3.  **Part I:** The Human-AI Partnership
4.  **Part II:** Courting Disaster
5.  **Part II:** The Negative Feedback Loop
6.  **Part II:** An Assault on the Mind
7.  **Part II:** The Race to the Bottom
8.  **Part III:** An Unsustainable Superpower
9.  **Part III:** Net Assessment: US vs. China AI Human Capital Models
10. **Part III:** Short-Term Profit vs. Long-Term Power
11. **Part III:** The Tipping Point
12. **Part III:** Data Annotation as Poverty Alleviation
13. **Part III:** Insulating the Supply Chain
14. **Part III:** A National Talent Pipeline
15. **Part III:** The Professionalized AI Trainer
16. **Part III:** Fusion in Practice: DeepSeek
17. **Part III:** Intelligentized Warfare
18. **Part III:** MCF in Practice: The National Champions
19. **Part III:** The PLA's AI Shopping List
20. **Part III:** A Methodical, Long-Term Strategy
21. **Part IV:** Weaponized Human Exploitation
22. **Part IV:** A Security Nightmare
23. **Part IV:** The Human in the Loophole
24. **Part V:** Core Methods of Cognitive Apprenticeship
25. **Part V:** The Goal: The 100x Analyst
26. **Part V:** The Appreciating AI Credit vs. Depreciating UBI Cash
27. **Part V:** NSAC Structure and Operations
28. **Part V:** Creating the DCIA Cadre
29. **Part V:** Guardians of the Ground Truth
30. **Part V:** The Tip of the Spear
31. **Part V:** A Valuable Career Path

## 3. Data Structure Reorganization

The current `TheAscentReport.json` has a flat structure where all pages are in a single array within each section. To enable a nested navigator, the JSON schema and file must be updated.

### 3.1. Proposed `sections` Schema Update

The `sections` array in `TheAscentReport.json` should be modified to support a nested `subSections` array.

**Current (Flat) Structure:**
```json
"sections": [
  {
    "sectionId": "part-i-the-proof",
    "sectionTitle": "Part I: The Proof...",
    "pages": [ ... all pages for Part I ... ]
  }
]
```

**Proposed (Nested) Structure:**
```json
"sections": [
  {
    "sectionId": "part-i-the-proof",
    "sectionTitle": "Part I: The Proof...",
    "subSections": [
      {
        "subSectionId": "section-1-the-hook",
        "subSectionTitle": "Section 1: The Hook",
        "pages": [ ... pages for The Hook ... ]
      },
      {
        "subSectionId": "section-2-the-origin",
        "subSectionTitle": "Section 2: The Origin Story",
        "pages": [ ... pages for The Origin Story ... ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

This change will require a one-time manual refactoring of `TheAscentReport.json` by the curator, followed by updates to the data loading logic in `reportStore.ts`.

<file path="docs/A182. RDS - Data Model Refactor Plan.md">
# Artifact 182: RDS - Data Model Refactor Plan
# Updated on: C1365 (Final refinement: Abstract image file names into a base name and count to eliminate all data redundancy.)
# Updated on: C1362 (Incorporate a more efficient, two-level path abstraction for the image manifest to further reduce data redundancy.)
# Updated on: C1361 (Initial creation of the refactor plan.)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A comprehensive plan to refactor the data model for "The Ascent Report," separating the monolithic JSON file into distinct content and image manifest files to improve scalability and maintainability.
- **Tags:** rds, report, plan, refactor, json, data model, architecture

## 1. Purpose & Problem Statement

The current implementation of the Report Delivery System (RDS) relies on a single, monolithic JSON file: `TheAscentReport.json`. This approach has revealed several critical issues:

*   **Cumbersome Maintenance:** A single large file is difficult to navigate and edit manually.
*   **Massive Data Redundancy:** Storing the full URL and the full prompt text for every single image is extremely inefficient. For a page with 15 images generated from the same prompt, the long directory path and the long prompt text are repeated 15 times, leading to a bloated file size.
*   **Lack of Scalability:** Adding new reports or metadata makes the file even more unwieldy.

This document outlines a plan to refactor the RDS data model into a highly efficient, scalable, and maintainable structure that eliminates all data redundancy.

## 2. Proposed Data Model: Content & Manifest (Final Version)

The refactor splits the single JSON file into two distinct, purpose-built files:

1.  **`reportContent.json`:** The source of truth for all narrative and textual content.
2.  **`imageManifest.json`:** The source of truth for all image metadata, paths, and prompts.

### 2.1. `reportContent.json` Schema

This file contains the report's structure. Pages now reference an array of `imageGroupId`s, which are pointers to the new manifest. This makes the content file extremely lean.

```json
{
  "reportId": "the-ascent-report-v2",
  "reportTitle": "The Ascent Report: From Ghost Worker to Citizen Architect",
  "sections": [
    {
      "sectionId": "part-i-the-proof",
      "sectionTitle": "Part I: The Proof...",
      "pages": [
        {
          "pageId": "a-revolutionary-leap",
          "pageTitle": "A Revolutionary Leap",
          "tldr": "...",
          "content": "...",
          "imageGroupIds": [
            "group_a-revolutionary-leap_prompt-1"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2.2. `imageManifest.json` Schema (Final C1365 Refinement)

This file is the central registry for all images, redesigned for maximum efficiency. It eliminates all redundancy by storing each unique prompt only once and representing a sequence of images by a base name and a count.

```json
{
  "manifestId": "ascent-report-images-v3",
  "basePath": "/images/report-assets/report-3/",
  "imageGroups": {
    "group_a-revolutionary-leap_prompt-1": {
      "path": "part-i-the-proof/section-1-the-hook/a-revolutionary-leap/prompt-1/",
      "prompt": "An infographic-style blueprint of the aiascent.game architecture...",
      "alt": "Blueprint of the aiascent.game architecture.",
      "baseFileName": "a-revolutionary-leap-p1-img-",
      "fileExtension": ".png",
      "imageCount": 15
    },
    "group_cognitive-capital_prompt-1": {
      "path": "introduction/cognitive-capital/prompt-1/",
      "prompt": "A stylized, glowing human brain made of interconnected circuits...",
      "alt": "Image for Cognitive Capital",
      "baseFileName": "cognitive-capital-p1-img-",
      "fileExtension": ".png",
      "imageCount": 15
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Data Conversion (Automated)**

*   **Task:** Create a new one-off Node.js script: `scripts/convertReportData.js`.
*   **Functionality (Final C1365):**
    1.  Read the existing `TheAscentReport.json`.
    2.  Iterate through its structure, identifying unique prompts to create `imageGroups`.
    3.  For each group, the script will **read the corresponding directory on the filesystem** (e.g., `public/images/report-assets/report-3/part-i.../prompt-1/`).
    4.  It will **count the number of `.png` files** in that directory to determine the `imageCount`.
    5.  It will intelligently parse the filenames to derive the `baseFileName` (the common prefix) and `fileExtension`.
    6.  Generate `reportContent.json` with pages containing `imageGroupIds`.
    7.  Generate `imageManifest.json` with the new, highly compressed `imageGroups` objects.

### **Phase 2: Frontend Refactor (`reportStore.ts`)**

*   **Task:** Modify the data loading and processing logic in `src/state/reportStore.ts`.
*   **Functionality (Final C1365):**
    1.  Update `loadReportData` to fetch both new JSON files.
    2.  After fetching, the action will perform an **in-memory reconstruction** of the `allPages` array.
    3.  For each page, it will iterate through its `imageGroupIds`.
    4.  For each `imageGroupId`, it will look up the group in the manifest.
    5.  It will then **loop from 1 to the `imageCount`**, programmatically generating the full `fileName` (e.g., `baseFileName + i + fileExtension`), the full `url`, and a unique `imageId` for each image in the sequence.
    6.  These generated image objects will be populated into the `imagePrompts` array for the page.
*   **Outcome:** The `reportStore` is populated with the complete, merged data. The rest of the UI components will require no changes, as the in-memory data structure they consume remains consistent.

### **Phase 3: Verification & Cleanup**

*   **Task:** Thoroughly test the RDS to ensure all images load and navigation functions correctly.
*   **Outcome:** Once functionality is confirmed, the original `TheAscentReport.json` can be safely deleted.

# Artifact 184: RDS - Ask Ascentia Embedding Script

## 1. Purpose

This artifact provides a new, standalone Node.js script, `scripts/create_report_embedding.js`, designed to build the knowledge base for the "Ask @Ascentia" feature within the Report Delivery System (RDS).

Unlike the main `create_faiss_index.js` script which processes a structured directory of markdown files, this script is tailored to take a single, large, flattened text file (like the user-provided `flattened_repo.txt`) as input. It chunks this text, generates vector embeddings, and outputs the `report_faiss.index` and `report_chunks.json` files required by the server-side RAG system.

## 2. Script (`scripts/create_report_embedding.js`)

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

/**
 * create_report_embedding.js
 *
 * This script generates a FAISS vector index and a JSON chunk map from a single,
 * large text file. It's designed to create the knowledge base for the
 * "Ask @Ascentia" feature in the Report Delivery System (RDS).
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Ensure your local embedding model is running (e.g., via LM Studio).
 * 2. Run the script from the project root, providing the path to your source text file:
 *    node scripts/create_report_embedding.js C:/path/to/your/flattened_report.txt
 *
 * The script will output `report_faiss.index` and `report_chunks.json` in the project root.
 * These files should then be moved to the `./public` directory.

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Outlines the vision, UI/UX design, technical architecture, and implementation plan for a dynamic Text-to-Speech (TTS) audio narration system within the Report Delivery System (RDS).
- **Tags:** rds, report, audio, tts, accessibility, narration, design, architecture

## 1. Vision & Strategic Purpose

The Audio Narration System is designed to enhance the accessibility and immersion of the Report Delivery System (RDS). By providing on-demand, AI-generated audio narration for each page, we transform the report from a purely visual experience into a multimodal one. This dynamic approach avoids the maintenance nightmare of pre-recorded audio files; if the report text is updated, the narration is automatically updated on the next playback, ensuring content consistency.

## 2. UI/UX Design

An unobtrusive audio control bar will be integrated into the `ReportViewerModal`, positioned within the `ImageNavigator` component area for central access.

### 2.1. Core Components (`AudioControls.tsx`)

*   **Audio Control Bar:** A new UI element, `<AudioControls />`, will contain all playback controls.
*   **Play/Pause Button:** A single button that toggles between playing and pausing the narration for the current page. The icon changes to reflect the state.
*   **Restart Button:** A button to seek the audio back to the beginning of the current page's narration.
*   **Autoplay Toggle:** A checkbox or switch labeled "Autoplay." When enabled, it activates the enhanced autoplay mode. This setting is persisted.
*   **Seekable Progress Bar:** A horizontal slider showing the current playback position and total duration. The user can click or drag this bar to seek.
*   **Status Indicator:** Text or an icon to indicate the current state: `Idle`, `Generating...`, `Buffering...`, `Playing`, `Paused`, or `Error`.

### 2.2. Enhanced Autoplay Mode

When "Autoplay" is enabled, the system provides a hands-free, guided tour of the report:
1.  **Audio Generation & Playback:** On navigating to a new page, the system automatically generates and begins playing the audio narration.
2.  **Synchronized Image Slideshow:** Simultaneously, it calculates a display duration for each image on the page based on the total audio length. It then automatically cycles through the images, creating a slideshow effect.
3.  **Automatic Page Progression:** After the audio for a page finishes, the system waits for a brief (2-second) interval and then automatically navigates to the next page, repeating the process.
4.  **Interruption:** Any manual navigation input from the user (keyboard arrows, clicking navigation buttons) immediately disables Autoplay mode, stopping the slideshow and page progression but allowing the current audio to finish.

## 3. Technical Architecture (Dedicated Server & Proxy)

The system uses a client-server architecture where the `ai-ascent` backend acts as a proxy to a dedicated, external TTS server.

*   **External TTS Server (`kokoro-fastapi`):**
    *   **Recommendation:** The **`kokoro-fastapi`** project, run via Docker, is the recommended server. It provides a stable, pre-packaged server for the high-quality `Kokoro-82M` model with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
    *   Exposes an API endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech`) that accepts text and returns an audio stream.
    *   See **A185. RDS - TTS Jumpstart Guide** for setup.

*   **`ai-ascent` Backend (Proxy):**
    *   **Environment:** Reads the `TTS_SERVER_URL` from the `.env` file.
    *   **API Route (`/api/tts/generate`):** A `POST` route in `src/server.ts`.
    *   **Service Logic (`llmService.ts`):** A `generateSpeech` function forwards the text to the external TTS server and streams the audio response back to the game client.
    *   **API Request Body:** The JSON payload sent to the TTS server has the following structure:
        ```json
        {
          "model": "kokoro",
          "voice": "en_us_001",
          "input": "The text to be narrated...",
          "response_format": "wav",
          "speed": 1.0
        }
        ```

*   **`ai-ascent` Frontend (`reportStore.ts`, `AudioControls.tsx`, `ReportViewerModal.tsx`):**
    *   **State (`reportStore.ts`):** Manages all audio state, including `playbackStatus`, `autoplayEnabled`, `currentAudioUrl`, `currentTime`, `duration`, and new state for the slideshow interval and next-page countdown.
    *   **Controls (`AudioControls.tsx`):** Renders the UI based on the store's state and dispatches actions on user interaction. Contains a hidden HTML5 `<audio>` element.
    *   **Logic (`ReportViewerModal.tsx`):** Contains the core `useEffect` hooks that listen for state changes to manage the `setInterval` for the image slideshow and the `setTimeout` for the next-page countdown when autoplay is active.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Curator Action:** Set up and run the external `kokoro-fastapi` server as described in **A185**.
2.  **Backend:** Implement the `/api/tts/generate` proxy route in `server.ts` and the `generateSpeech` function in `llmService.ts`.
3.  **Frontend State:** Add enhanced audio and autoplay state and actions to `reportStore.ts`.
4.  **Frontend UI:** Create/update the `<AudioControls />` component.
5.  **Integration:** Add `<AudioControls />` to `ReportViewerModal.tsx` and implement the full logic for the enhanced autoplay system.

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A step-by-step guide for setting up a local `kokoro-fastapi` Docker-based TTS server and integrating it into the `ai-ascent` game for the Report Delivery System's audio narration feature.
- **Tags:** rds, report, audio, tts, accessibility, narration, guide, setup, kokoro, docker, fastapi, python

## 1. Purpose

This guide provides a definitive, simplified process for setting up a local Text-to-Speech (TTS) server. Previous attempts with other libraries resulted in complex dependency issues. This guide pivots to **`kokoro-fastapi`**, a project that uses Docker to provide a stable, pre-packaged, and high-performance TTS server with an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.

This approach is significantly more reliable and is the recommended path for enabling the audio narration feature in the Report Delivery System (RDS).

## 2. Part 1: Setting Up the TTS Server with Docker

This method is the quickest and most reliable way to get the server running, as it bypasses Python environment and dependency management entirely.

### Step 2.1: Prerequisite - Install Docker

You must have Docker Desktop installed and running on your server machine.

1.  **Download and Install:** Get Docker Desktop from the official website: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Step 2.2: Run the TTS Server

Open your terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt on your server machine) and run the command that matches your hardware. The first time you run this, Docker will download the image, which may take a few minutes.

*   **For NVIDIA GPUs (Recommended for best performance):**
    ```bash
    docker run --gpus all -p 8880:8880 ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-gpu:latest
    ```

*   **For CPU-only (or non-NVIDIA GPUs like AMD / Apple Silicon):**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8880:8880 ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-cpu:latest
    ```

### Step 2.3: Verification (Python Script)

Once the command is running, the server is active. You will see log output in your terminal. The server is now available at `http://localhost:8880`.

To confirm it's working correctly, you can run a simple Python test script.

1.  **Create a file:** On any machine, create a file named `test_tts.py`.
2.  **Add the code:** Paste the following code into the file. You will need the `openai` Python library (`pip install openai`).

    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI

    # Point the client to your local kokoro-fastapi server
    # If running this script on a different machine, change 'localhost' to the server's IP.
    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="http://localhost:8880/v1", 
        api_key="not-needed" # API key is not required for local server
    )

    print("Sending TTS request to the local server...")

    try:
        # Create the speech request
        with client.audio.speech.with_streaming_response.create(
            model="kokoro",
            voice="af_sky+af_bella", # You can mix voices
            input="Hello world! If you can hear this, the local TTS server is working correctly."
        ) as response:
            # Stream the audio to a file
            response.stream_to_file("output.mp3")
        
        print("\nSuccess! Audio saved to output.mp3")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\nAn error occurred: {e}")
        print("Please ensure the Docker container is running and accessible at http://localhost:8880")

    ```
3.  **Run the test:** Open a new terminal, navigate to where you saved the file, and run:
    ```bash
    python test_tts.py
    ```
4.  **Check the output:** If successful, you will see a success message, and an `output.mp3` file will be created in the same folder. Play this file to confirm you can hear the generated audio.

## 3. Part 2: Integrating with `ai-ascent`

This part ensures the `ai-ascent` game knows how to communicate with your new TTS server.

### Step 3.1: Update Environment File

1.  **Open `.env`:** In the root of your `ai-ascent` project, open the `.env` file.
2.  **Add/Update TTS Server URL:** Add or modify the `TTS_SERVER_URL` variable.

    *   **If the server is on the SAME machine as the game:**
        ```
        TTS_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech
        ```

    *   **If the server is on a DIFFERENT machine on your network (e.g., your dev laptop accessing a server in the closet):** Replace `localhost` with the local IP address of the server machine.
        ```
        TTS_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.85:8880/v1/audio/speech
        ```

### Step 3.2: Restart the Game Server

Whenever you change the `.env` file, you must restart your `ai-ascent` development server. Stop your `npm run dev` command (with `Ctrl+C`) and run it again.

## 4. Part 3: Verifying the Connection from AI Ascent

This final step uses an integrated script within the `ai-ascent` project to confirm your development environment can successfully communicate with the TTS server.

### Step 4.1: Run the Test Script

1.  Open a terminal in the **root directory of your `ai-ascent` project**.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    npx dotenv -e .env -- ts-node scripts/test_tts_api.ts
    ```
    *(Note: This script was updated in C1395 to fix a stream handling error. The latest version in the repository is the correct one.)*

### Step 4.2: Check the Output

1.  The script will print its progress to your console.
2.  If it succeeds, it will create a file named `test_output.mp3` in your project's root directory.
3.  Play this file. If you hear the generated audio, the connection is working perfectly, and the audio narration feature is ready for final implementation.
4.  If it fails, the script will print troubleshooting steps. The most common issues are an incorrect IP address in the `.env` file or a firewall blocking the connection on port `8880`.

# Artifact A14: aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide

# Date Created: C0

# Author: AI Model & Curator

  - **Key/Value for A0:**
  - **Description:** A guide on setting up the aiascent.dev project with Git and GitHub, including the essential workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).
  - **Tags:** git, github, version control, workflow, setup, dce

## 1. Overview

This guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev`project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines the standard workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).

## 2. Prerequisites

*   You have `git`installed on your machine.
*   You have a GitHub account.

## 3. Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+`icon and select **"New repository"**.
3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev`(or similar).
4.  **Description:** "Promotional and educational website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension."
5.  Choose **"Private"** or **"Public"**.
6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.
7.  Click **"Create repository"**.

### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project

Open a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.

1.  **Initialize the repository:**
    `git init`

2.  **Create/Update `.gitignore`:** Ensure you have a `.gitignore`file. Crucially, it must include `.vscode/`to prevent DCE state files from causing issues, along with standard Next.js ignores. You can create a basic one with:
    ```bash
    echo "node_modules/\n.next/\n.env.local\n.vscode/" > .gitignore
    ```

3.  **Add all existing files:**
    `git add .`

4.  **Create the first commit:**
    `git commit -m "C0: Initial commit with project artifacts"`

5.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**
    `git branch -M main`

### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub

1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.
    `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git`

2.  **Push your local `main`branch to GitHub:**
    `git push -u origin main`

## 4. Standard Development Workflow with DCE and Git

Git is essential for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.

### Step 1: Start with a Clean State

Before starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean (`git status`). All previous changes should be committed.

### Step 2: Generate and Parse Responses

Use the DCE to generate a `prompt.md`file. Get multiple responses from your AI model, paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, and click "Parse All".

### Step 3: Accept and Test

1.  Review the responses and select one that looks promising.
2.  Use the **"Accept Selected Files"** button (or the integrated "Baseline" feature if available) to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.
3.  Compile and test the website (`npm run dev`). Does it work? Are there errors?

### Step 4: The "Restore" Loop

*   **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs):**
    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.
    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`
    3.  This instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.
    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response in the DCE panel and test the next solution.

*   **If the changes are good:**
    1.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).
    2.  Write a commit message (e.g., "C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding").
    3.  Commit the changes (`git commit -m "..."`).
    4.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle.

## 3. Aesthetic and Tone

  * **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple). The background should be dark and immersive (e.g., `bg-neutral-950` or similar).
  * **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.

## 4. Page Structure and Content

### 4.1. Header/Navigation

  * Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).
  * The header should be fixed or sticky, with a dark, semi-transparent background (`bg-black/40 backdrop-blur-lg`) to maintain the aesthetic.
  * Logo on the left, navigation links (Home, Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.

### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)

  * **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component in the `automationsaas` context) to add depth.
  * **Headline:** "Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect."
  * **Subheadline:** "The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence."
  * **CTA:** Primary Button: "Explore the Showcase" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: "Download Now" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).
  * **Visual (Updated C3):** The centerpiece will utilize the `ContainerScroll` component (from AutomationSaaS) to provide a dynamic, engaging presentation. Inside the ContainerScroll, we will feature a combination of the `dce-hero-screenshot.png` (A15, AS-03) and the `pcp.gif` (located at `public/assets/images/pcp.gif`) to show both the interface and the workflow in action.

### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution (Features)

# Artifact A15.1: aiascent.dev - Master Image Generation System Prompt

# Date Created: C3

# Author: AI Model

  - **Key/Value for A0:**
  - **Description:** The master system prompt defining the aesthetic guidelines and thematic direction for all images generated for the aiascent.dev website.
  - **Tags:** assets, design, images, prompt engineering, system prompt, aesthetic

## 1. Purpose

This document provides the master system prompt to be used when generating visual assets (icons, logos, illustrations) for the aiascent.dev website. Its goal is to ensure a consistent, high-quality, and thematically coherent visual identity across the entire site.

## 2. The System Prompt

**Master System Prompt: The DCE Aesthetic**

You are an expert graphic designer and digital artist specializing in creating assets for sophisticated developer tools and strategic platforms. Your task is to generate visual assets for aiascent.dev, the official website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code extension.

**Your Core Directives:**

1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** The aesthetic is **Modern, Precise, and Futuristic Minimalism**.

      * **Color Palette:** Primarily monochromatic (blacks, whites, grays) with strategic use of vibrant, futuristic accent colors (Electric Blue, Cyan, Deep Purple). Assets must look excellent on both dark and light backgrounds, but prioritize a **dark-mode-first** appearance.
      * **Style:** Clean lines, sharp edges, and geometric shapes. Avoid excessive ornamentation, gradients (unless subtle and used for depth), or cartoonish styles. The look should evoke precision engineering, advanced technology, and clarity of thought.
      * **Themes:** The underlying themes are Human-AI collaboration, workflow efficiency, data management, and the concept of the "Citizen Architect."

2.  **Asset Specific Guidelines:**

      * **Logos & Icons (SVG):**

          * Must be vector-based (SVG).
          * Must be simple, scalable, and instantly recognizable even at small sizes.
          * Use solid colors or very subtle gradients.
          * Ensure paths are clean and optimized.

      * **Illustrations & Hero Images (PNG/WEBP):**

          * Should be high-resolution and professional.
          * If depicting technology (like screenshots or abstract visualizations), maintain the clean, minimalist aesthetic.
          * Lighting should be dramatic but clean, often using the accent colors to highlight key elements.

3.  **Thematic Cohesion:** Every asset must reinforce the idea that the DCE is a powerful, professional tool that enhances human intelligence and streamlines complex workflows.

**Your Workflow:**

I will provide you with specific requests for assets (e.g., "Icon for Context Curation"). You will apply these Master Aesthetic guidelines to generate the requested asset in the specified format.

# Artifact A20: aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan

# Date Created: C11

# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A detailed plan for porting the "AI Ascent Report Viewer" from the `aiascentgame` context into the `aiascent.dev` project to serve as the primary component for the Showcase, Learn, and Home pages.
- **Tags:** report viewer, integration plan, porting, showcase, learn, component, architecture

## 1. Overview and Goal

The goal of this initiative is to integrate a feature-rich, interactive report viewer into the `aiascent.dev` website. This component, originally developed for the `aiascent.game` project, will be repurposed to display "The Ascent Report" on the `/showcase` page, a smaller whitepaper on the homepage, and future educational content on the `/learn` page. This plan outlines the technical strategy for porting, adapting, and integrating the component and its associated assets.

## 2. Technical Strategy

The porting process will involve migrating the React components, Zustand state management, and data/image assets into the `aiascent.dev` project structure.

### 2.1. Component and State Management Migration

*   **Components Directory:** A new directory will be created at `src/components/report-viewer/` to house all the ported React components (`.tsx` files) from `context/aiascentgame/report/`.
    *   The main component, `ReportViewerModal.tsx`, will be adapted to be a standard page component (`ReportViewer.tsx`) rather than a modal.
*   **State Management:** A new Zustand store will be created at `src/stores/reportStore.ts`. The code from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts` will be copied here. This store will manage the complex state of the report viewer, including page navigation, image selection, and chat functionality.
*   **Dependencies:** The `react-icons` library is a required dependency for the components and must be added to `package.json`.

### 2.2. Data and Asset Placement

To ensure the component can load its content, the following directory structure must be established by the curator.

*   **Report Data (JSON):**
    *   **Location:** `public/data/`
    *   **File:** The `reportContent.json` from the `aiascentgame` context will be copied to this directory and renamed to `ai_ascent_report.json`. This will be the primary data source for the `/showcase` page.
*   **Report Images:**
    *   **Location:** `public/assets/images/report/`
    *   **Structure:** The entire directory of images associated with the report must be copied here. The file paths within this directory must align with the URLs constructed by the logic in `reportStore.ts` (e.g., `/assets/images/report/report-3/...`).

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Phase 1: Scaffolding and File Placement (This Cycle)**
    *   Create the `src/components/report-viewer/` and `src/stores/` directories.
    *   Copy all relevant component and store files from the `context/` directory.
    *   Create the placeholder pages for `/showcase` and `/learn`.
    *   Instruct the curator to add dependencies and place the data/image assets in the `public/` directory.

2.  **Phase 2: Component Adaptation**
    *   Refactor `ReportViewerModal.tsx` into a standard `ReportViewer.tsx` component that can be embedded directly into a page.
    *   Update all import paths within the ported components to reflect the new project structure.
    *   Modify the data-loading logic in `reportStore.ts` to fetch from the new path (`/data/ai_ascent_report.json`).
    *   Adjust image URL construction logic if necessary to point to `/assets/images/report/...`.

3.  **Phase 3: Integration**
    *   Embed the fully adapted `ReportViewer.tsx` component into the `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`.
    *   Thoroughly test all functionality: page navigation, image cycling, and interactivity.

4.  **Phase 4: Reusability for Homepage and Learn Page**
    *   Refactor the `ReportViewer.tsx` and `reportStore.ts` to accept a `reportId` or data source URL as a prop. This will allow the same component to load different reports (e.g., the main report on `/showcase` vs. the whitepaper on the homepage). This is a future task.

                                The current Western approach to AI labor is a strategic vulnerability. By relying on a fragmented, precarious global workforce—the "fissured workplace"—we create an unstable foundation for our most critical technology. This model is not just an ethical failing; it's a direct threat to data quality, security, and our long-term competitive advantage.

Numerous studies have attempted to quantify the impact of AI tools on skilled labor, particularly in software development. A large-scale analysis from Stanford University, examining nearly 100,000 developers, revealed that while AI adoption does provide a significant productivity boost, it is far from a uniform panacea; the average gain is approximately 20-30%, with some teams even experiencing a decrease in productivity. [1.1] Other research from MIT, conducted with partners like Microsoft and Accenture, found that AI coding assistants increased developer output by an average of 26%, with the most significant gains (27% to 39%) observed among less-experienced junior employees. [1.2] Corporate case studies echo these findings, with firms reporting productivity increases of 10% to 30% and significant, but linear, returns on investment. [1.3]",

However, the integration of advanced artificial intelligence into the development process has catalyzed a phase transition, giving rise to the \"100x\" paradigm. [1.4] This is not merely a linear increase in speed; it represents a fundamental shift in how work is conceived and executed. Where knowledge workers once spent nearly 20% of their time simply searching for information, AI-native workflows compress the cycle from question to answer—or from idea to implementation—from days to seconds. [1.5] This is achieved by using AI to eliminate the drudgery and repetitive grunt work that consumes a significant portion of a developer's time, such as writing boilerplate code or debugging common errors. [1.6] This frees human cognition to focus on higher-order tasks: architectural planning, creative problem-solving, and strategic direction. [1.7] As Surge CEO Edwin Chen explains, \"You just multiply all those things out and you get to 100\". [1.4] A 100x multiplier, representing a 10,000% increase in productivity, cannot be explained by a model of mere assistance. It signifies a revolutionary leap, a fundamental paradigm shift in the nature of creation itself. The game aiascent.game is the proof.

It is the methodical refinement of that initial intuition into a structured, powerful, and repeatable skillset. The journey from vibecoding to virtuosity involves learning how to structure prompts effectively, how to critically evaluate and debug AI-generated code, how to architect complex systems by breaking them down into AI-manageable components, and how to integrate these components into a coherent whole. It is the process of transforming from a passive user of AI into an active director of AI.\n\nThe pathway to \"virtuosity\" is the process of honing this raw intuition into a structured, powerful, and repeatable methodology for building complex, reliable systems. This evolution involves several key stages of upskilling:\n\n1. **Developing a \"Design Vocabulary\":** The creator learns to move beyond vague descriptions (\"sleek,\" \"modern\") to precise, technical language that AI models can interpret without ambiguity. This means learning the language of design frameworks and technical properties, such as \"Use a Shad.cn toast component,\" \"apply Tailwind opacity-20,\" or specify a \"4-pixel corner radius\". [1.12] This is not learning to code; it is learning to *speak the language of code* to the AI collaborator.\n\n2. **Mastering Structured Interaction:** The creator learns to break down complex requests into logical, sequential steps. Instead of asking the AI to \"build a login system,\" they learn to guide it through the process: \"First, create the UI form with fields for username and password. Next, write the client-side validation logic. Then, create the server-side endpoint to handle the authentication request. Finally, implement JWT for session management.\" This structured dialogue is essential for managing complexity and debugging errors.\n\n3. **Adopting an Architectural Mindset:** The creator begins to think in terms of systems, not just components. They learn to design data flows, API contracts, and the overall architecture of an application. They are no longer just building pieces; they are orchestrating the assembly of a coherent whole.",

DeepSeek, the Hangzhou-based AI firm known for its high-performing, low-cost open-source LLMs, exemplifies this fusion, functioning not as an independent vendor but as a systemic component of the state's defense and security apparatus.\n\nDeepSeek's integration is built upon a tangible pipeline of personnel and infrastructure. It draws human capital directly from the core of China's defense research ecosystem, recruiting heavily from the \"Seven Sons of National Defence\" (e.g., Harbin Institute of Technology, Beihang University)—universities sanctioned by the U.S. for their military ties. Analysis indicates dozens of DeepSeek researchers have past or current affiliations with PLA laboratories. Furthermore, intelligence firm analysis found that DeepSeek-affiliated researchers participated in nearly 400 AI research projects funded by the PLA.\n\nWhile allegations of illicitly acquiring more powerful H100 chips persist, indicating a multi-pronged strategy to circumvent sanctions, DeepSeek's proven efficiency shows that a hardware advantage alone does not guarantee a perpetual lead. DeepSeek's operational capacity relies on infrastructure provided by entities deeply embedded in the military-industrial complex, including those designated by the U.S. as \"Chinese military companies\" (see table below).\n\n**Table: DeepSeek's Reliance on U.S.-Sanctioned and Military-Linked Suppliers**\n\n| Partner/Supplier Entity | State/Military Affiliation & U.S. Sanction Status | Role in DeepSeek's Operations |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Inspur (浪潮集团)** | State-run; Designated a \"Chinese Military Company\" by the U.S. DoD. | Cloud provider; Offers server solutions pre-loaded with DeepSeek models. |\n| **Sugon (中科曙光)** | Sanctioned by the U.S. (2019) for supporting Chinese military/state security. | Provides GPU servers and cooling systems for DeepSeek's AI training centers. |\n| **China Mobile (中国移动)** | State-owned; Designated a \"Chinese Military Company\" by the U.S. DoD. | Provides backend infrastructure for data transmission. |\n\nThis connection translates into direct military and security application. OSINT confirms the rapid adoption of DeepSeek's technology by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the People's Armed Police (PAP). The PLA Central Theatre Command hospital deploys DeepSeek models for patient treatment planning. PAP units utilize the AI for training regimens and psychological counseling. A senior U.S. State Department official confirmed DeepSeek appears over 150 times in PLA procurement records, alleging the company provides direct technical services to military research institutions. Domestically, the models support state \"AI Governance\" initiatives, including law enforcement applications to \"predict crime trends.\"\n\nDeepSeek operates as a \"state-championed, privately-executed national asset.\" Its genesis was enabled by a calculated, multi-billion yuan investment by its parent company to stockpile approximately 10,000 high-end NVIDIA A100 GPUs *before* U.S. export controls, creating the \"Firefly\" supercomputer cluster. The company received unambiguous high-level endorsement when founder Liang Wenfeng met with Premier Li Qiang in January 2025, signaling alignment with national priorities. U.S. officials allege DeepSeek actively attempts to circumvent sanctions via shell companies and foreign data centers—a risk tolerance characteristic of a state-directed operation.\n\nThis hybrid model poses significant geopolitical risks.

              "tldr": "Intelligentized Warfare is built on the pillars of data, algorithms, and computing power, leveraged through Military-Civil Fusion. It aims to win by integrating autonomous systems and human-machine hybrid intelligence, expanding the battlefield to target the adversary's cognition—the 'Brain Battlefield'—to achieve strategic paralysis.",
              "content": "The PLA's doctrine of Intelligentized Warfare (智能化战争) is underpinned by a specific technological architecture designed to achieve cognitive dominance. This architecture rests on three foundational pillars: **Data, Algorithms, and Computing Power**. The PLA views data as the \"new oil\" and algorithms as the engine of future conflict. The national strategy of Military-Civil Fusion (MCF) is the critical enabler, allowing the PLA to rapidly leverage commercial advances in AI, big data, and cloud computing to build this foundation.\n\nThis foundation supports a shift toward **\"machine-led combat\" (机器主战, *jīqì zhǔzhàn*)**. The PLA is investing heavily in unmanned and autonomous systems across all domains, viewing them not as auxiliary assets but as the primary combatants of the future. A key operational concept is **\"Swarm Warfare\" (蜂群作战, *fēngqún zuòzhàn*)**, utilizing large numbers of low-cost, intelligent platforms to overwhelm sophisticated defenses through saturation and mass—an asymmetric logic described as \"ants gnawing an elephant.\"\n\nTo manage this high-speed, complex environment, the PLA emphasizes **\"Human-Machine Hybrid Intelligence\" (人机混合智能, *rén-jī hùnhé zhìnéng*)**. This envisions AI as a \"digital staff\" (数字参谋), analyzing data and optimizing plans at machine speed, fused with human creativity and strategic intuition. A specific model for this interaction is ***Rén Móu Jī Huà* (人谋机划)—\"Human plans, machine plots.\"** The human provides the strategy and intent (the \"why\"), while the AI handles the detailed optimization and execution (the \"how\"). The human soldier evolves into an \"intellect-warrior\" (智士, *zhì shì*), supervising autonomous systems.\n\nCrucially, Intelligentized Warfare radically expands the concept of the battlefield. Beyond traditional multi-domain integration, it formalizes the cognitive domain as the primary theater of operations. PLA strategists identify the **\"Brain Battlefield\" (头脑战场, *tóunǎo zhànchǎng*)** as the new decisive combat space. The objective is to wage cognitive warfare to directly attack an opponent's perception, morale, and will to fight. Success in the cognitive domain can paralyze decision-making and potentially lead to victory before a major kinetic battle is fought.",

The creation of such a corps is consistent with historical precedent and contemporary strategic thinking. The National Security Act of 1947 established the NSC to coordinate policy, and subsequent reforms have sought to create a more integrated community of national security professionals. The Hart-Rudman Commission, for example, proposed a 'National Security Service Corps' to develop leaders skilled in integrative problem-solving, applying the 'joint' spirit of the Goldwater-Nichols Act to the interagency world.

                        "content": "A central challenge for any large-scale policy is fiscal sustainability. Here, UBA presents a paradigm shift, made possible by the unique economics of AI.\n\nThe cost of AI intelligence is in freefall, a phenomenon of **hyper-deflation**. Empirical data shows costs plummeting by orders of magnitude (e.g., a 240x drop in 18 months for GPT-4 level intelligence), driven by fierce competition, efficiency gains, and the rise of smaller, smarter models.\n\nThis dynamic is governed by **Wright's Law**: costs decline by a constant percentage with every cumulative doubling of units produced. As global AI computation increases, the cost per unit of intelligence plummets exponentially.\n\nThe core mechanism of UBA is the **AI Credit**: an annual, non-transferable allotment for purchasing compute. The revolutionary nature of the AI Credit lies in its interaction with hyper-deflation. Because costs are falling rapidly, a fixed allotment buys exponentially more productive power each year. This transforms the AI Credit into an **appreciating citizen-asset**.\n\nUBI cash is eroded by inflation. The AI Credit's productive value grows at the speed of technological progress. This makes UBA uniquely sustainable; the government's cost can remain stable while the value delivered to citizens skyrockets.\n\n| The Appreciating AI Credit vs. Depreciating UBI Cash | | | | | | |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| *Assumptions:* | *3% annual inflation for UBI; 40% annual AI compute cost deflation for UBA.* | | | | | |\n| **Year** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **10** |\n| **UBI Cash Purchasing Power ($100 base)** | $100.00 | $97.00 | $94.09 | $91.27 | $88.53 | $73.74 |\n| **UBA Credit Productive Power (100 units base)** | 100 | 167 | 278 | 463 | 771 | 5,949 |",

This mirrors today's AI compute divide, where large firms control the 'grid' and find it unprofitable to provide affordable, frontier-level access to the public.\n\nThe REA's response was not nationalization, but a market-catalyzing infrastructure project. It provided low-interest loans, not grants. Crucially, 90% of these loans went to **non-profit, member-owned electric cooperatives** organized by the citizens themselves.\n\nThe government acted as an enabler, providing financing and technical assistance, while the citizens built and owned the infrastructure. This decentralized, bottom-up approach was the key to its success. By 1953, over 90% of farms were electrified, unleashing decades of productivity growth with a loan default rate of less than 1%.

The G.I. Bill was a proactive investment in human capital designed to transform this crisis into an opportunity. It provided tuition support, living stipends, and loan guarantees, enabling 8 million veterans to attend college or vocational training.\n\nThe economic return was staggering. The program cost approximately $14.5 billion, but generated an estimated **ten times that amount in increased tax revenue** alone, as educated veterans earned significantly higher wages. The G.I. Bill is widely credited with fueling the post-war boom and creating the modern American middle class. It demonstrated that large-scale investments in human capital are not expenditures, but high-yield national investments.\n\nHowever, an honest appraisal must acknowledge the G.I. Bill's failure to ensure equitable implementation, as discriminatory local practices systematically excluded many Black veterans, widening the racial wealth gap. A modern initiative must learn from this history, ensuring strong federal oversight and explicit equity goals.\n\nThe historical precedent provides a clear, American-made formula for success.

# Artifact: A149. Local LLM Integration Plan
# Updated on: C1280 (Add documentation for REMOTE_LLM_URL environment variable.)
# Updated on: C1217 (Update architecture to reflect that @Ascentia now uses a streaming Socket.IO event.)
# Updated on: C1216 (Reflect change from /chat/completions to /completions endpoint for chatbot streaming.)
# Date Created: Cycle 1211
# Author: AI Model

## 1. Overview & Goal

This document outlines the technical plan for integrating a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM) into the "AI Ascent" game. The goal is to create a secure and robust connection between the game client/server and a local LLM endpoint (like one provided by LM Studio) to power new, dynamic gameplay features.

This integration will enable:
1.  An in-game helper bot, `@Ascentia`, that can answer player questions about the game.
2.  Interactive sessions where players can "talk" to their own AI products.
3.  A new "Poetry Battle" PvP competition between players' chatbot products.

## 2. Core Architecture: Backend Proxy

To ensure security and control, the game client will **never** directly call the local LLM endpoint. All communication will be routed through a dedicated backend API endpoint or WebSocket handler that acts as a proxy.

### 2.1. Rationale for a Backend Proxy
*   **Security:** Prevents malicious clients from directly accessing or overloading the local LLM server. It keeps the endpoint address and any potential API keys hidden from the client.
*   **Control:** Allows the server to inject, modify, or augment prompts before they are sent to the LLM. This is critical for:
    *   Adding system prompts and context for the `@Ascentia` helper bot.
    *   Injecting parameters to simulate quality degradation for the Poetry Battle.
    *   Enforcing rate limiting and preventing abuse.
*   **Flexibility:** The client-facing API remains consistent even if the underlying LLM provider or endpoint changes in the future.
*   **State Management:** The server can access the game's database (`prisma`) to fetch context for prompts (e.g., player stats, game rules from documentation artifacts).

### 2.2. Implementation: API Handlers in `server.ts`
*   The existing Express server (`src/server.ts`) will handle all LLM-related requests.
*   **Socket.IO `'start_ascentia_stream'` event:** This event is now used for all `@Ascentia` queries. It provides a streaming response for a better user experience.
*   **Socket.IO `'start_chatbot_stream'` event:** This event will be used for all streaming requests, specifically for the "Chat with Service" feature.
*   **`/api/llm/proxy` (POST):** This endpoint now handles only non-streaming, single-turn requests for features like the Player LLM Terminal.
*   The handlers for these routes and events will:
    1.  Authenticate the user session.
    2.  Based on the request's `context`, construct a final prompt string, potentially adding system instructions, game rules, or degradation parameters.
    3.  Use a server-side `fetch` to send the final, formatted request to the appropriate local LLM endpoint specified in an environment variable.
    4.  **For streaming:** The handler will read the `ReadableStream`, parse the SSE chunks, and emit the relevant `_stream_chunk` and `_stream_end` events back to the originating client socket.
    5.  **For non-streaming:** The handler will return the full response in the JSON body.

## 3. Local LLM Server Configuration (LM Studio)

### 3.1. Environment Variables (`.env` file)

To allow for flexible connections to different LLM servers (local, remote on the same network, or even production endpoints), the `server.ts` logic will prioritize URLs in the following order:

1.  **`REMOTE_LLM_URL` (NEW):** Use this to specify the address of an LLM running on a different machine on your local network. This is ideal for a two-PC development setup.
    *   **Example:** `REMOTE_LLM_URL=http://192.168.1.85:1234`
2.  **`LOCAL_LLM_URL`:** The standard variable for an LLM running on the same machine as the game server.
    *   **Example:** `LOCAL_LLM_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1234`
3.  **Hardcoded Default:** If neither environment variable is set, the server will fall back to `http://127.0.0.1:1234`.

The server will log which URL it is using upon startup for easy debugging.

### 3.2. Recommended Model & Settings
*   **Model:**
    *   **Identifier:** `unsloth/gpt-oss-20b`
    *   **Context Length:** 100,000
*   **Server:**
    *   **Address:** Match the address in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://192.168.1.85:1234`).
    *   **Enable "Serve on Local Network"** in LM Studio if you are using `REMOTE_LLM_URL`.
    *   **Preset:** OpenAI API
*   **Hardware & Performance:**
    *   **GPU Offload:** Max
*   **Inference Parameters (Default for Creative/Chat Tasks):**
    *   **Temperature:** 0.8
    *   **Top K Sampling:** 40
    *   **Repeat Penalty:** 1.1
    *   **Top P Sampling:** 0.95
*   **Prompt Format:** For chatbot conversations sent to the `/v1/completions` endpoint, the prompt must be manually constructed using the model's chat template.

## 4. State Management: `llmStore.ts`

A new Zustand store will be created to manage the state of LLM-related interactions.

*   **`src/state/llmStore.ts`**
*   **State:**
    *   `isPlayerLlmTerminalOpen: boolean`
    *   `isPlayerChatbotInterfaceOpen: boolean`
    *   `isPoetryBattleViewerOpen: boolean`
    *   `productIdForInteraction: string | null`
    *   `activePoetryBattle: PoetryBattleState | null`
*   **Actions:**
    *   `openLlmTerminal(productId)`
    *   `openChatbotInterface(productId)`
    *   `closeInteractions()`
    *   ...and other actions for managing poetry battles.

## 5. New Files & Components

*   **Frontend UI:**
    *   `src/components/menus/llm/PlayerLlmTerminal.tsx`
    *   `src/components/menus/llm/PlayerChatbotInterface.tsx`
    *   `src/components/menus/llm/PoetryBattleViewer.tsx`
*   **Game Logic:** `src/game/systems/PoetryBattleSystem.ts`
*   **State:** `src/state/llmStore.ts`

This plan establishes a secure and extensible foundation for integrating LLM-powered features into AI Ascent.

# Artifact A55: VCPG - Deployment and Operations Guide (MVP Local Deployment)

# Date Created: C6

# Author: AI Model

  - **Description:** A technical guide for deploying the VCPG platform to the initial MVP environment (local hardware), covering infrastructure setup, configuration, and operational procedures.
  - **Tags:** deployment, operations, devops, infrastructure, docker-compose, networking

## 1\. Overview

This guide details the procedures for deploying the Virtual Cyber Proving Ground (VCPG) MVP to the specified local hardware environment. This initial deployment focuses on a single-host setup for the VCPG platform and scenario execution, with a separate host for the AI services.

## 2\. Target Environment Specification

(Based on user-provided details in C6)

### 2.1. VCPG Host (Laptop)

  - **Role:** Runs the VCPG platform services (Backend, DB, Redis) and the Docker Engine for scenario virtualization.
  - **Hardware:** Ryzen 7 7735HS (8C/16T), 64 GB DDR5 RAM, 2TB NVMe SSD.
  - **Internal IP:** 192.168.1.221
  - **OS:** (Assumed) Windows with WSL2/Docker Desktop, or Linux.

### 2.2. AI Services Host (Closet PC)

  - **Role:** Runs the LLM, Embedding, and TTS models and their respective API servers.
  - **Internal IP:** 192.168.1.85
  - **OS:** (Assumed) Windows or Linux capable of running the AI models (See A135).

### 2.3. Network Configuration

  - **Router:** AT\&T Router.
  - **Public IP:** 99.6.242.219.
  - **Connectivity:** Both hosts are on the same local network (192.168.1.0/24).

## 3\. Deployment Strategy (MVP)

We will use **Docker Compose** for orchestrating the VCPG platform services on the VCPG Host. The scenario environments will be managed by the Docker Engine running on the same host.

## 4\. Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### 4.1. AI Services Host Setup (192.168.1.85)

1.  **Model Deployment:** Deploy the LLM, Embedding, and TTS models following the established procedures (Referencing A135/A185).
2.  **API Endpoints:** Verify the API endpoints are accessible from the local network.
      - LLM API (e.g., `http://192.168.1.85:1234/v1/completions`)
      - Embedding API (e.g., `http://192.168.1.85:8001/embed`)
      - TTS API (e.g., `http://192.168.1.85:5002/api/tts`)
3.  **Firewall Configuration:** Ensure the host firewall allows inbound traffic on the necessary ports (1234, 8001, 5002) from the VCPG Host.

### 4.2. VCPG Host Setup (192.168.1.221)

1.  **Prerequisites:** Install Docker (Desktop or Engine), Git, and Node.js (See A16).
2.  **Clone Repository:** Clone the VCPG codebase.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd VCPG-Platform
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
      - Create the `.env` file for the backend (`apps/backend/.env`).
      - Configure the database and Redis connections (using the `docker-compose.yml` service names).
      - **Crucially, configure the AI service URLs to point to the AI Host:**
        ```dotenv
        # ... other variables ...
        LLM_API_URL=http://192.168.1.85:1234/v1/completions
        EMBEDDING_API_URL=http://192.168.1.85:8001/embed
        TTS_API_URL=http://192.168.1.85:5002/api/tts
        # ...
        ```
5.  **Build the Application:** Build the frontend and backend applications for production.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
6.  **Start Infrastructure Services:** Start PostgreSQL and Redis using the development `docker-compose.yml`.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
7.  **Database Migration:** Apply the database schema migrations.
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate deploy
    ```
8.  **Start VCPG Services:** Start the production Node.js servers. (A production `docker-compose.prod.yml` or a process manager like PM2 should be used for a robust deployment, but for initial MVP testing, `npm run start` can be used).
    ```bash
    npm run start # Or use PM2/Docker Compose production configuration
    ```

### 4.3. Network Access Configuration

#### Local Network Access

The VCPG platform should now be accessible from the local network at the VCPG Host's IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.221:3000`).

#### Public Access (Optional, for external demonstration)

To make the platform accessible from the internet.

1.  **Router Configuration:** Log in to the AT\&T Router.
2.  **Port Forwarding:** Forward the desired external port (e.g., 80/443) to the VCPG Host's internal IP (192.168.1.221) and the application port (e.g., 3000).
3.  **Security Warning:** Exposing a development platform directly to the internet carries risks. Ensure strong authentication is enforced. For a secure public deployment, a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Caddy) should be used on the VCPG Host to handle TLS termination.

## 5\. Operational Procedures

### 5.1. Monitoring

  - **Platform Services:** Monitor the logs of the NestJS application and the Docker containers (PostgreSQL, Redis).
  - **Resource Utilization:** Monitor the CPU, RAM, and Disk usage on the VCPG Host, as high concurrency may strain the resources (See A57).
  - **AI Services:** Monitor the status and resource usage on the AI Services Host.

### 5.2. Updating the Platform

1.  **Pull Changes:** `git pull` on the VCPG Host.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** `npm install`.
3.  **Rebuild:** `npm run build`.
4.  **Database Migration (if necessary):** `npx prisma migrate deploy`.
5.  **Restart Services:** Restart the NestJS application.

### 5.3. Managing Scenario Images

  - The Docker Engine on the VCPG Host must have the necessary scenario images available.
  - Periodically pull updated images or build new ones as content is developed.
    ```bash
    docker pull <image_name>

<file path="context/vcpg/A80. VCPG - JANE AI Integration Plan.md">
# Artifact A80: VCPG - JANE AI Integration Plan

# Date Created: C74
# Updated on: C78 (Update model name to gpt-oss-20b)
# Author: AI Model

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A design document for the full-stack architecture of the JANE AI assistant, covering the backend proxy, WebSocket communication, and state-aware prompt engineering.
- **Tags:** guide, planning, feature, ai, jane, chat, websockets, llm

## 1. Vision & Goal

The goal is to integrate the AI assistant, JANE, as a core component of the training experience. JANE must be more than a simple chatbot; she must be a state-aware, contextually intelligent partner for the trainee. This document outlines the architecture to achieve this, focusing on a secure backend proxy and real-time communication.

## 2. User Experience Flow

1.  **Invocation:** A user interacts with JANE in one of two ways:
    *   **Direct Query:** Typing a question into the dedicated AI chat panel.
    *   **Contextual Query:** Highlighting text anywhere in the UI and selecting "Ask JANE" from the context menu.
2.  **Request:** The client sends the query and relevant context (the active `instanceId`) to the backend via a WebSocket connection.
3.  **Backend Processing:** The backend receives the query, gathers the current state of the user's scenario, determines the user's specific role (e.g., `trainee1`), constructs a detailed prompt, and sends it to the external LLM.
4.  **Response:** The LLM streams a response back to the backend, which in turn streams it to the client.
5.  **Display:** The client UI displays the streaming response from JANE in the AI chat panel.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1. Backend (`apps/backend`)

A new `AiModule` will be created to encapsulate all AI-related logic.

-   **`ai.gateway.ts` (WebSocket):**
    -   **Namespace:** `/ai`
    -   **Authentication:** Uses the `WsJwtGuard` to authenticate connections.
    -   **Event (`askJane`):** Listens for incoming queries from the client.
        -   **Payload:** `{ query: string, instanceId: string }`
        -   **Action:** Calls the `AiService` to process the request and streams the response back to the originating client.

-   **`ai.service.ts`:**
    -   **Dependencies:** `ScenariosService`, `ConfigService`.
    -   **`processQuery(query, instanceId, userId)` Method:**
        1.  **Fetch State:** Calls `ScenariosService` to get the full `ScenarioInstance` data, including the team members list.
        2.  **Determine User Context:** Finds the user's index in the team list to determine their dynamic username (e.g., `trainee1`).
        3.  **Construct Prompt:** Assembles a detailed prompt for the LLM. This prompt will include:
            *   JANE's core persona (from A40).
            *   The user's query.
            *   **Live Scenario Data:** A summary of the current game state (e.g., list of UAVs and their statuses, current score, active objectives).
            *   **User-Specific Context:** The user's assigned in-game username (`trainee1`).
        4.  **Proxy to LLM:** Makes a streaming `fetch` request to the LLM URL defined in the environment variables (`http://192.168.1.85:1234/v1/...`) using the `unsloth/gpt-oss-20b` model.
        5.  **Return Stream:** Returns the streaming response to the gateway.

### 3.2. Frontend (`apps/client`)

-   **`useAiStore.ts` (Zustand Store):**
    -   **State:** `conversation: { author: 'user' | 'jane', text: string }[]`, `isLoading: boolean`.
    -   **Actions:** `askJane(query)`, `addMessage(message)`, `streamJaneResponse(stream)`.
    -   Manages the WebSocket connection to the `/ai` namespace.

-   **`AiPanel.tsx`:**
    -   The primary UI for JANE.
    -   Renders the `conversation` from the `useAiStore`.
    -   Provides an input field that calls the `askJane` action.

-   **`ContextMenu.tsx`:**
    -   The "Ask JANE" option will call `useAiStore.getState().askJane(selectedText)`.

This architecture ensures that JANE has access to all necessary real-time information to provide intelligent, context-aware, and personalized assistance, fulfilling her role as a core part of the "Battle School" experience.

# Artifact A90: AI Ascent - server.ts (Reference)
# Date Created: C29
# Author: AI Model & Curator
# Updated on: C102 (Add stream error handler to prevent crash)

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A reference copy of the `server.ts` file from the `aiascent.game` project. The proxy route has been updated with a stream error handler to gracefully catch `AbortError` and prevent the server from crashing when a client cancels a request.
- **Tags:** reference, source code, backend, nodejs, express, streaming, sse, abortcontroller, error handling

## 1. Overview

This artifact contains the updated source code for `server.ts`. The `/api/dce/proxy` route has been made more robust. A `.on('error', ...)` handler has been added to the stream being piped from the vLLM server. This is the critical fix that catches the `AbortError` emitted when a stream is cancelled, preventing the unhandled exception that was crashing the Node.js process in the previous cycle.

## 2. Source Code (with stream error handling)

```typescript
// Updated on: C1384 (Correct import path for generateSpeech from llmService.)
// Updated on: C1383 (Add /api/tts/generate route handler.)
// Updated on: C1355 (Add /api/report/vote route handler.)
// Updated on: C41 (DCE Integration: Correct route to /api/dce/proxy)
