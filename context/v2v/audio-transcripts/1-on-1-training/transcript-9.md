And now it looks good too. When I, so you export it, uh, you can, you can see the Excel in the flatten and then it tells you the, the, the token size. Like it's, it's really nice. Um, now I'm planning out the phase two, which is the basically a clone of notepad plus plus the way I use that multiple tabs. If the reason I'm bringing this up is because I'm doing the planning phase now. So it may be beneficial to look at some of the documentation that I'm creating, because it's mirroring the same documentation creation process that I did when I started this VS Code, like from phase 0, like phase 1. 

But again, the reason why we wouldn't do that is because there's something more pertinent, which would be helping y 'all get y 'all's documentation in order. Talking about putting the chicken before the egg would just help you give you more perspective forward thinking for putting the documentation together, or if you think you're good, you just want some guidance based off that, I'll just let, I'm just sort of, you know, spitballing. 

Agreed. 

mm -hmm yeah the version of the are you do you need excels do you have Excel documents all right let me just package this then and then I'll send actually yeah let me just package what I have I'll give you a new one anyway because it'll be Excel friendly your guess is as good as mine I'll ask my colleague my friend my discord friend who has tried to install it and he's had success I'll see if he has to reinstall it I haven't actually installed it I just, the way I do it, I just click the run button and I'm in the, I get it, the dev environment. I haven't tried the, yeah, the package. The file, it's 41 kilobytes. 

How big? 

Well, it was, I thought it was smaller before even, but I'll just upload. That's what I'll do. 

Google Drive. 

I wonder if I ever do like a full -fledged official publish where it gets on the extension store or whatever, then it would become more universal. And then I just dropped a link that should you may in general chat in discord. You may or may not need a permission I don't know if if you do I'll get the request check its shares when people with yeah, there we go. Okay Oh and I added I made sure delete worked so you could press the delete button Little things the less you have to switch tabs the better. I'll be right back. I have a coffee ready 

Uh, I sent a URL in the general chat in Discord. Delete immediately. Yeah. Uh, maybe it was some, I don't know what it was that made it bigger. 

Let me double check. 

It did get bigger. 

I'm double checking like, oh no. 

Okay. 

Yeah. Yeah. The second one was about the same size. Probably the libraries I added like, uh, to parse the PDF and to get to the XLS. 

Yeah. 

That would be my guess. 

Um, yeah. you be able to double click it? Share your screen. Yeah, so it's in the very bottom. It's on the left. It's all I see the tab on the left, far further left on the bottom. 

Yep. There it is. Yeah. 

So, okay. No, it wouldn't be there. It would be something where you could get into that extension to either delete it or into that extensions settings. 

Could you uninstall that? Yeah. Is there? 

I haven't ever uninstalled it. And I can also just see if my friend knows. Oh, I can, I'll see if I can find instructions in this book. 

Okay, cool. 

Perfect. 

Yeah, I can't read, I can't read that text or else I would have caught it. You're a gloriously large monitor. No, it doesn't, it doesn't, that doesn't, it's a book. pixel issue. Cool. 

Did you double -click it it or it didn't? 

Extensions manage manage extensions. Do you see that or so like extensions tab or anywhere manage extensions? So I thought I saw something up here Okay, is that it below the cat on the left a bit up one up one? Oh, you can click and drag those cool already. So now it handles it'll handle XLS So you just click the button and then you get your flattened XLS you get your flattened PDF without any You won't even get a have to manage the markdown file. 

It's just there. 

It's just done So all you've got to do the only thing you can't do from here is click and drag new files in just use the regular Explorer for that. 

Okay, I organized a lot of documentation as like reference documents and they were sort of like documents that I figured would be like a rock that wouldn't change, that would be like a starting point, like point A. And then you can create a second artifact once you get started, that will be this working living document, but you've always got your rock behind. 

And then while you're moving it to a completed deliverable, which would be your artifact three, your third deliverable artifact that you'll just produce and then like leave a carbon copy of, because the deliverable ends up going into Confluence or going somewhere else. it's beneficial for you to make that third extra copy. So I only see this, uh, VS code. Okay. Sorry. You were, you were also duplicating your audio. 

I've muted it. Can you, yes. So what was your question on this document? Yeah. You could literally wrap it as a artifact, uh, create a new artifact. Um, it's a, it's a PDF, so just name it, you know, um, initial starting point, literally just name it that dot PDF and drop it in. 

And then you can reference that as your initial starting point. Anything within it, you can talk about it as a thing. And then produce from that rock, from that rock you can grow, right? 

Maybe it's a seed, not a rock. 

Maybe a seed is a better analogy. Perfect. Initial starting point is essentially what you're building. An overall initial starting point, yeah. You won't break out, you'll break up. 

So you'll produce documents from your initial, you get what I'm saying? 

And then your new documents will be like, haha, excellent. I'm planning ahead what you should, uh, I got a plan. I know what you'll do once based on the way you're getting started. Uh, so no worries. Uh, keep, keep cooking, keep cooking them. I have an idea whenever you're ready to listen. 

Okay. As you're doing this, the, uh, the file structure, what we'll do is we'll just click expand all when you're finally done and we'll take a screenshot of that. And then we'll just let AI turn that into an initial. documentation artifact that'll be your initial structure, and that'll be artifact zero, or artifact number one. Artifact zero is a master list, which will list artifact one and all subsequent artifacts that we create. From that, with that list, artifact one, what you're gonna add in there is what is the significance of the folders, so that it is known from the get -go, like it'll help keep the organization structure that you've already started, and then it'll build upon that notion of organization that you've already got. 

Otherwise, I foresee some misalignment with the model and your structure. I think just, yep, so that'll be something you just would want to add in, a description, basically, under each file, or folder, I should say. Even file, file on the initial list, yes, that might even be a good idea. Why did you add this file? file what is your intent to use yes uh like a one sentence two sentence that's not even two sentence you know And then you're really ready for cycle one at that point. 

Well, that's what I was thinking. Control Z. Pillar 2 allows us KUI, which would be nice. 

And let me tell you one thing as well. 

As you're going, you'll see some missing, maybe you'll notice that the AI is hallucinating somewhere. 

With this process, what that really is enlightening you of is you're missing some documentation. You're missing something that the AI, if it had in its context, it wouldn't be having to hallucinate. Yeah, keep that in the back of your mind as well. So you can kind of pull the trigger when you feel 80%. You know what I mean? That's what I mean. 

So don't feel like you have to be afraid. 

well yeah and then you'll start making living documents that can turn into templates later because you've got you let's say you've already got templates for state at state a listen then we'll get a template at state Z yeah oh yeah 

And check this out. This is pretty meta. What you can also do is once you've got, let's just say you're done with this project and you're moving on to another, you can take this entire prompt and wrap it as example one and then just move on and then you don't have to sort of regurgitate all the boilerplate. It serves as training data. It's pretty epic. It's pretty epic. 

Yep. Okay, so we will build into this. The way we will build into this is the first thing we will build into is that files list I was talking about, because those are the two things that I manually add. There's a files list section right there, and then the files, because that's what changes. And then the cycles, I add a new cycle, obviously, that comes from me. But that's it, that's all the manual sort of changes. 

So the way we'll do the files list is just click the expand all up a bit. Yep, it should be the first one or the right one. The first one on the right. Oh, and let's also turn that one on too. Yeah, yeah. And then, yeah, sorry, that one. 

Okay, so we'll try to get, we want to capture basically two screenshots, it looks like. One of the top half and one of the bottom half. And then you're just gonna, just so you can send it to AI and let AI transcribe it into a text for you. Yep, precisely. Yeah, put it into the text. studio. 

And then at the same time, I will give you a template that it will follow to create. So let me send that just a basic, and that'll give a jumpstart to your whole solution. Drop them both as just copy, paste, or what have you, into a chat, a new prompt, a fresh AI prompt. And then we're going to be giving instructions shortly. I'm going to help you construct some of the initial instructions. Yeah, let's use AI studio. 

Yeah, and then we'll ask shortly I'm getting an example of a master artifact list and I'm getting an example of a file tree put together and I'll just send you those two and then okay I got one done. Let me find the right file for the next one. There we go, this one, dot, dot, dot, okay. Example file tree structure, cool. And then just say dot, dot, dot, cool. And then I'll do the dot, dot, dot up here, okay. 

Okay, so please take the two screenshots and turn them into a, let me see, artifact zero, master artifact list. for this new project. Then, please, for the files, let me say, I'll explain that part second. So I've already got that written. So please take this two screenshots and turn them into an artifact one file tree structure list, and then a master zero artifact list for this new project. you can follow the structure in the two examples below. 

Cool. So I'm going to send you this in Discord somehow. General chat, I guess. It's too long. Let me try a private message here. Still too long. 

I'll cut it and I'll just delete the first. Yep. And then I'll give you the second example. Yep. So you'll take, you'll take from please and then everything below. And then if it gives you any like, you know, Pac -Man said, just delete that. 

Ah, so see the thinking budget on the right. We'll go ahead and turn that on as well. It's a toggle. it allows you to manually set it much much just max that slider out to the right yeah and it's fine for this it's for now we gave it all the instruction it needs it doesn't need the whole thing is less than 8 000 tokens so and then so now so this if if if you wanted to have an easy way to compare this you could do two three four of the same copy and paste it in for the purposes of now if you want to eyeball to see if that list is acceptable you see what i'm saying but if you had If you had multiple, then you could literally diff and see which one's longer. You would just know, like, at a glance, if you knew one was 55 or 56, you could see, diff it, and see, well, where's the extra line? So that's the immediately, like, you could, see what I'm saying? 

Yeah, yeah, but this should be fine, yeah. And it'll, oh, it'll be fine, because the script'll share any new ones that come up. Yes, this is a perfect initial. Okay, so let's see what it looked like as well. Yeah, that's right, that's right. I would just, let me see. 

Yeah, actually, it's fine, I just wish it, oh, I know why it didn't do it. I'm going to write you a sentence to write back and we'll see if it fixes. Can you also wrap the two artifacts in tags which correspond to their file names? I'll be adding these in as artifacts into a docs folder in this repository. See what I'm saying? It missed that notion. 

There you go. Copy and paste errors and all what you can do is is if it if it it should be just fine AI studio is quite good with the context above But I just yes, there we go See now now you can just copy the artifact a1 up there for the file name when you're creating a new file. 

What have you? You see it's much and oh and then if you cop I don't like the way this looks I copy this out into notepad But that's just probably personal preference as long as you're able to get this data out Did it miss C? Do you see artifact one? Do you see? Oh, the header. I just want to do a spot, a validation check. 

Can you check the header where it says artifact one of the initial output? Yes. You see, I want to compare with what you just highlighted visually. Yep. Yep. For the artifact one header. 

Okay. It's literally verbatim. Cool. 

Good, good, good, good, good, good. 

For some reason I thought it was different. Yeah. First I would create a new file in your repo. Cause now you're getting sort of, this is the, You've essentially done cycle zero, because you're using AI to organize your data at the very basic starting point. You're, yes, yes. Artifacts, you've just created artifact zero and artifact one. 

Everything can go in artifacts, one folder, just A1, A2, A3, A4, and we can worry about organizing in like another, when you want to create set of content for some other process. Yeah, don't put, yeah, yeah. It gave you the name, it's a markdown file. It wants it, yep. Yeah, see I don't I wouldn't trust the download because I don't know what it'll name it. It'll probably just name a code Yeah, I would do that and put it into a notepad and you'll see why especially if you have a notepad plus notepad plus plus if you have Yes. 

Yeah. Okay. Good. Let's do this the right way. It's fine. We'll do this. 

This is good because notepad plus plus will if you save a notepad file as a markdown file, then when you paste this in, it'll have the beautiful colors and it'll really help you visually know what part is the code and what part to copy out. So we'll get you set up in the way. 

And this will only be temporary until I make the whole actual integrated thing. 

You're just too fast. I was hoping it would be ready before. So now save this. Exactly. Perfect. Now just save this thing. 

as markdown okay yeah now click in the drop down for the file type oh when you get to the right spot so this so this is not an artifact this is a working document that you're dumping responses into yep so you could literally name it response one because you may have a response to tab later if you do parallel tasks in the future so you can just save this as response one literally it now this to your point to your question should we have multiple prompt files Yes. 

Should we have multiple response 1s? 

No. You don't need multiple response 1s. Does that make sense? Okay. All the very bottom should be marked down. All the way. 

The very, very, very... 

Is that it? 

I can't read it. If you're not dark mode, do the one just above it. 

So you have to... You just have to change your Notepad++ to dark mode. 

It's not that big of a deal. But... Or else... Or else some tints might be hard to read with the light color. So if... You are already light mode. 

So if you want to just choose that or if you want to make the change, you can. okay yeah go ahead and see and if it bothers your eyes then just go find where in notepad plus plus i can help you just response anywhere else anywhere outside of your project no i literally yeah i save it in my downloads it doesn't it has no it's arbitrary it's free it's so you can find it again at that point beyond that as long as you can find it again it doesn't matter yeah you don't want it to be not this one yeah this is your process document yeah Response one, yeah. Because you just organized your tabs, so you keep, yeah, response one. And then it's clean. Okay, cool. So now you should be able to see cleanly what you should name your thing, and then everything within the brackets is that artifact. 

That's what you're gonna copy into the file you create. Yeah, cool. You found it? Perfect, that's what it looks like to me. And then there's some minor tweaking choices, but yeah, there you go. Now you're in hacker mode, man. 

It's not just cool, man. When you're scrolling through thousands of lines, bro, it's necessary. I would do this in VS Code, and you'll see why in a second. 

Let's go to VS Code, and then let's go to the Explorer, not my extension, unfortunately. 

Yeah, go to the explorer, the top left, almost, the two, yes. Now go to where artifacts are, where you're gonna drop all these documents that the AI is creating. Right click, is that where? Is it gonna be in the documents or artifacts? Okay, then new file, right? Okay, well, before you do new file, go get that file name in your clipboard, so go copy the file name, and then now go new file, and then name it. 

That what you pasted what you paste it does need to be exact. Yeah, you know, it has nothing. 

No, no, no, no, no, no, no Rename that to what you the name of the artifact. 

Show me the Notepad. Yep. So you see artifact 1 a 1 pillar tree. Yes markdown file. Yes, sir Yes, sir. That is the name and everything in between. 

Yes. No problem. 

Hey, don't be sorry man. 

No, no, no Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. The shit is all over. I'm all over the place There's no lesson, there's no, and then just delete the extra markdown. Cool, now everything that's in that bracket, in those bracket, within the, from the response one notepad, everything in between the artifact one title, where it's orange, yeah, all the way down to where the artifact one ends, which is right basically. 

Up one, up a little bit. Up a little bit? Yeah, I would get the three back ticks as well. Get those as well. Those are, down one more line. yep yep yep trust me trust me it'll help your it when you flatten it everything will be clean if you don't if you unless you don't do that okay yep paste it right in there all right you've literally created your first artifact that is the process that you will be rinsing repeating so now you know the name of the second artifact now anytime you need to update this it's very easy you just copy paste it But now you need to create artifacts. 

I guess artifact, yep. 

Artifact zero, is that correct? Yeah, just make sure you don't get those carets. Just delete them if they show up. 

And then paste those. 

I find going from the bottom up works in this copying process. 

I don't know why. It's, I don't know why. 

Yeah, it's easier to control. 

And then delete that last little, yeah, yep. 

Because the script will do that. The script will create those for you based off the file name, okay? Oh, it's even got descriptions for you. You see, and you can qualify those and update them. And that would be a very important task for you to make sure those descript... And not only that, not only that, but it'll be kept up to date over time by the AI. 

It'll update this artifact. Okay? I would, so you don't have to, but I would go through sometime or go back to the other artifact and review those descriptions and especially the descriptions for the files because, yeah, because the AI did not have those files at the time, it just had the screenshots. Well, this is gonna be basically how you can help build context for the overall project for the AI. Because, for example, why did you create this folder? There you go. 

Yeah. Checkbox. 

Yes, sir. 

Yes, sir. And then, yes. Yeah. That's an important thing. And see, precisely what you're doing is super important. 

And you're learning the right vocabulary. 

Certain things like draft means expect this to get changed. 

Versus reference document, don't expect this to be changing this. You see what I'm saying? That's truly, truly, truly what you're doing right now. It will pay in dividends to do this because you're putting the knowledge the institutional knowledge to yeah to deposit Institutional knowledge you can say it like that is what you're doing. Yeah, let's see how it does it at this point though Do you want to save everything save all your dot make sure everything's saved and then you can go back to my My extension and then make sure everything's selected minus the prompt if that was one thing I wreck I realize is don't I stopped saving my prompt in my repo because if I selected it, then it would duplicate in my flattening. You don't want to flatten your own prompt because the repo goes in the prompt. 

So select everything except your prompt if your prompt file is in here. So you should just be able to, yes, select all instantly like that. And then what's so big, first of all? And what's the total size? That's fine. If it's under a million, you're Gucci at the very, very bottom. 

Just great. Yeah, you're good. You're totally good. Yeah, yeah, deselect that one for sure. Oh, I thought I... that! 

Oh, I'm so sorry. 

Oh, man, hold on. 

Okay, so just select it all, and then if you just remove it from below, it'll work. And I'll show you how to do it easily. Click on the prompt where you're looking at it. Click on it to open it. Double click, I guess. Oh, there's no prompt file? 

Okay, yeah, yeah. No, I can fix it. I can show you. There's an alternative to do that. I swore I fixed that. But just, yes. 

Now, now, hmm. Over on the, okay, just look on the left in the selected item section, you should be able to click on prompt in there, prompt in B. I think I see it, is it number 12, number 13 down there? At the very, yes. You should, yeah, you can, yeah, just click the X there. Yeah, click, yeah, see? Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Sorry about that, that was, that's annoying. But that works, okay. Those are folders, it's fine. That's fine, yeah. Yeah, then it was working fine. Oh, it was working fine. 

That's okay, that's okay. I'm not, I'm not worried about that. It'll auto add anything new, don't worry. We turn that on. Yeah, you can flatten context. And then creates this file. 

Now let's glance through to make sure there's no encoded data. So you can click and drag on the right. But I don't, yeah, what does all that say? 21 items. Yeah, I see that. 

Okay, that's fine. 

What kind of document is that? What's the name of that file? They're probably related to the, I mean, that's a bug for me to fix for sure. I can fix that. I just, I can't read. Don't worry. 

Yeah, give me the error codes and then we will, I will look at them really quick. I already know some plans. I already know. I just need to get the same files from you and then get the same error. Yes. So it's all very generic, unfortunately. 

Okay. Yeah, it did. Now, this first... I think those are... I honestly think those are not... Actually, I think it did its job. 

This is what I... 

See how it's popping up like this? I think because as you're scrolling. I actually think it's because it's encoding. 

And this encoding is an easy fix. 

This is normal. 

It just needs to be handled. Yep. So, don't worry. I totally got this. So, only certain files this would have happened. The other files it would have been fine with. 

I just need to get the file that this happened for. and then process it accordingly. So what we can do is go to the very top to where it started, and then what is this file that's ruined? Oh, it's a docx file. Oh, I didn't handle docx yet. Sorry, dude. 

That's why it's happening, because I handled PDF, I handled XLS, I haven't handled docx yet. 

Right. That'll be next, I guess, on the list. I'll do that for you tomorrow. But in the meantime, if you open it and copy it, yeah. Oh, man. Oh, don't, don't bop. 

Oh, man. One, two, you got at least 10. 

Oh, if you open them and turn them into PDFs and replace it, same difference. 

And you'll be able to move forward without waiting for me to make an update. 

Yeah. Okay. 

Then you can wait. 

It's up to you. 

It won't take me but a day. 

I didn't even think about that. That's all I needed to know. 

I'll fix it. 

Easy. I just need to code it. Yep. Easy. I've done it already. yeah that's right yeah yeah so if you just uh anything that says docx in that list if you just remove it won't you know it won't you just remake your selection and we know the spacebar work does yeah oh and you can also save your selections in the future up in the top there's a save button by the way yes those will be fine just the docx i believe oh you can sort by file type by the way as well by the way You can just click the icon. 

Not that one. That's file name. Click on the one above. Click on the one above. The one to the left. It's an icon. 

That one. There you go. Now you're sorting by file type. Yes. And it autosort. Yes. 

Dude, I... Yes. Yep. Flatten again. 

And then it'll clean it up. 

There you go. No errors because it was related to the thing. Oh wait, hold on. Did those pop back? Oh no they didn't, you scrolled up, okay. Zero tokens, interesting. 

I see more down there, keep going. What's that garbage? See on the right, I'm looking on the right, you see the red? Ooh, what file is that? Another . docx, it really didn't? 

I'll have to experiment with that. Yep, but it should still take things out. I'll fix that as well, I'll test that. Can we, ah, so the colors are token count, yep. Yeah, so hover over the token count, you'll actually get a little bit of a... No, it's not off. 

I made a poor choice in my decision making. I made a... I honestly made a poor decision. I thought orange would look more severe. So I... Yep, my bad. 

So this is.. . It's already saved. It gets saved when it gets created. Ah, at the very bottom it should be. Right there. 

In your, yep, yep. And so when it's not messy, you can just copy and paste that into your prompt file at the bottom. That'll be, remember how I said you're copying and pasting two things? The files list, which is actually just your artifact zero. Yeah, you see? You would be, I wouldn't do it now, let's not copy these stupid encoded symbols. 

But yeah, that's, yes, open the template we had, the prompt template. Yeah, it would go in the, at the very bottom, file section. 

Just in between there, in between files. 

Because it's all your files. It's your flattened repo, basically. It'll always get created and placed there. It doesn't have to. I can make an option where you can direct where you would like it to go. 

That's a good idea. 

But right now, there's only going to be one. 

No, it's only that. 

It just gets updated. 

When you click flatten, it's recreated. So let's imagine a workflow. Let's say you get a new artifact back in Artifact 2. You create the new file. When you create the new file, because you've got it checked, it'll auto do the checkbox for you. And then you drop in your artifact that you got from the AI. 

then you just save your file normal so you didn't do anything you don't do anything different and then you just click flatten that will pick up the new file because of the checkbox was automatic and then you just see so you don't change your your workflow you you copy you create the file copy it in click the button copy and copy uh copy in the flattened repo because it was just updated so this is um yeah this is Each project gets its own prompt file because that prompt file is the process. And so you could just imagine, yeah, just imagine, so the flattened repo for now is, you can only see it now because it hasn't been fully automated. It'll disappear just like how, as you can see in here, there's no copies of your PDF files. There's just the PDF file, but clearly we have it in Markdown because you can go dig through the flattened repo. It's in there as Markdown, not the broken ones. The prompt, so the flattened repo is basically just part of the prompt file and the prompt file is the overall process to create the NC doc. 

It will only be there. And then you can mine from that prompt file the necessary information to create some second static content. Because you see what I'm saying? Yeah. What is it? The flattened repo? 

I would be putting it in the prompt file that I'm currently building the static content for. It is project specific. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, okay. 

Sure. That's fine. Now that I know what you're doing, it's fine. Yeah, there's the PDF stuff or text file stuff. Yes, sir, it does. And then I just find, see right there. 

So I just find, I find I get better performance when I also put the files list at the top. I would recommend doing it. Yes, it does show up in here, but I would recommend, I haven't, it hasn't hurt me. See, I have the files list section, right? Down a bit. So that's in the inner, up a bit. 

Yes, in between. No, no, it should be in both places. Remember I said there are two things that I, yep. Oh, because yeah, it just makes, okay. So the files are all the files. It just so happens that the files list is a file as well. 

It's just self -referential. It's not, it's not the end of the world. And, and if you don't check this out, if you don't want to put the files list at the top of your prompt, because let me say it like this, AI, large language models, they read one token at a time from the start. And so in my mind, in my mind, giving it the files list up early is beneficial so it can plan ahead. It can think about while it's reading your cycles because it's already got the files list in its mind as it's going through the cycles. That's the way I think about it. 

It hasn't steered. I have no research, but I feel it works better. If you don't want to copy and paste, you don't have to. But that is what that is. The reason that is the root, the driving factors to why I did that in the first place. 

Was getting bad performance. 

That was one of the things I changed at the time I was getting bad performance and I stopped getting bad and I was able to move forward in my projects in in which I Would definitely keep that net. 

I don't know why you want to remove the metadata at the top. I don't know I wouldn't touch it Yeah, I did it for a reason. I did it that way for a reason. 

Yeah, just copy it into the file section If you don't, again, if you don't want to, you can just delete files list and you can delete the reference of it in the interaction schema and you don't have to worry about it. 

And you can see if you don't get bad performance because you know what? When I started doing that, it was a year ago, two years ago. There were older AIs. Maybe you don't need it. Maybe it's overhead you don't need to worry about. But that is the route. 

I got better performance doing it this way. 

And right now it's manual. 

I haven't found a way to... I don't have a way to parse it in right there yet. I'm going to build that in. You won't have to worry about it soon. And only up in the files... No, no, not the whole thing. 

Control Z. I get it. I get it now. 

I get it now. 

Now go over to Artifact. 

No, in your Artifacts list, it'll be easier if you just go to the M... Is it M0 or M1? I forget. I'm sorry. Your Artifact 1 or Artifact 0. So it should be over there on the left. 

You see your Artifacts tab? 

Yep. Down a bit. Up. Yep. Which one of those is your... Oh, it's Artifact 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. 

Yeah, click on that. copy this whole thing. That's all your copy. Yes. That's yeah. My mistake. 

I'm sorry. Yeah. No, we weren't clear. That goes in your files list. And that is because that is your file because that became that is your files list. Yes, sir. 

Right there. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. See that? See that? 

See what I mean? So so it no, so it's a see, that's all your project metadata is what's easy. 

That's I truly firmly believe I don't have any evidence, but I truly firmly believe when it's reading your context, we will excuse me when it's reading your cycle, And that's why my cycles go in the order that they do. 

They don't go 0, 1, 2, 3. They go 35, 34, 33. They go all organized because I'm thinking like the AI reads. That's all. And another thing about how the attention works is every word it's reading. it looks for every other mention. 

Think of it like it does a complete search for that word through the whole document. And it gets like key value pairs of related information around every time that word shows up. So as it goes through every time. 

So that's kind of as it reads every word. 

So if you say, you know, like, you know, that, you know, one of those keywords right there, it'll just go, yeah, yeah. That's how the attention mechanism works. And make sure it's not checked, though. Uncheck your prompt files, yes. Now that, yeah, now that you get it in a clearer, clearer, yep. That was just a one -off. 

It could have been your cycle zero. It totally, we could have done that as well. You get what I'm saying? You could have just wrote the same message, and then no difference. But it's fine now. You had literally no extra metadata to include. 

You were creating it from scratch. Now that you're in this position, you can go to your cycles section. That's correct. Is there already a cycle one? Yep. So then that's fine. 

Perfect. That's fine. That's fine. Yep. Above it, you'll be making cycle one that looks just like cycle zero. So you can copy the two lines for cycle zero, paste them, and then name the one above one. 

And that'll give you the mental structure. 

Yep. 

And then change the ones above the zeros above to one because you go upwards. But then, yeah, before you send it, delete that. Right. But this mentally, that's how you're going to construct them. That's right. Your cycles go up. 

That's right. Yep. Like a history. It's reading. It's reading from top, like a book. It's reading a book. 

And it needs to know what to work on now. Everything else is in the history. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. That's my, this is it. This is it, man. I don't know if this is like hard to conceptualize or easy or what, but this is it. 

This is how it works for me. This is how I keep the situational awareness. It's this order. Yes. No, no, no, no. That's right. 

That's right. That's how AI works. That's how AI works. That's how large language models work. They read one token at a time. From the first token you give it to the last token. 

Right. Well, you would do one cycle at a time because you would analyze the results. It's what you want to ask for. Yeah, right. 

Yeah, that's right. 

So you just correct. 

Absolutely. 100%. Now you're thinking like key value pair. Yes, that's exactly how it works. And that's only shorthand for you. That's only shorthand for you. 

You could just say your chat GPT summary and just be done with it. But yeah, absolutely. That is you're you're you're getting it. This is the transferring. This is exactly the basic, straightforward, not rocket science. Yes. 

No problem. Delete Cycle 1, we'll do Cycle 0 first, and then you'll write Cycle 1 when you're ready to write Cycle 1, and it'll make more sense as we go through it. It's just I just wanted to illustrate it goes up. Yeah, what you got? Yep. So in cycle 0 you could start saying like No, put it in between it's in between it's everything in between the tag. 

Yep, like DNA. I think of it like DNA. I don't know So so no, no, no, no, you're even already too. No, no totally abstract, bro Totally high level totally like what is it that you're trying to do here? What do you want to do? What is it? 

Why did you bring all these documents together? I'm trying to make a training for these people. I currently have these pieces together. I'm looking to plan out further. Let's go ahead and get some initial documentation planned out. Let's turn the list of ELOs into something. 

Now you see where I'm going? And then analyze those results. 

Trust me. 

And then we'll see. Yeah, he knows a lot. Nope, you're talking to, you think like you're writing to a colleague. It'll get you, it'll get your typos, don't worry. You're assigning a junior a research task. It gets easier. 

It gets easier as you do it as much as you feel comfortable, honestly, as much as you feel it's once you feel like you've hit sort of writer's block. That's again, that's the beauty of this is it solves the blank page problem. You're going to get something back in line and it'll help spur the next cycle. And then what you could ask, maybe what are some of the artifacts you're going to need? 

You could start with an outline. 

What would be an outline of what the static content based off of our requirement or what we're the ask is. It can start helping create an outline, which then, you know, you've got a section one, okay, you can now build out section one. Now build out section two. Those, yeah, thinking and just, if there is a particular one, yes. Perhaps manually. 

If it's a PDF, it's already in the context. 

Yep, so you can talk, yeah, it's in there. 

That's the hard part's done. 

You can just speak about it. 

It'll be, yeah, to get started like that. 

That's right, yeah. Also, if they're all in the same directory, you can just reference the director. Yes, sir, yes, sir. Templates directory, UKI templates, yeah, sorry, what was that? Oh, put it in single backticks, put it in one backtick. Whenever you're talking about a specific item, that's what I do. 

Do one backtick and then do the, because that's actually how Markdown accepts it as code, inline code. So just type backtick, which is right next to one, and then type UKI templates as is, as it appears, and then backtick, and then you can say directory, there you go. 

That's how I do it now. 

And I didn't start doing it that way. 

I do it now. Me either, man, until, yeah. 

until like maybe two months ago. 

Yes. Yeah, the tilde, yeah. Yeah, directories, names, file names, it's just anything that is like defined. Yeah, and yeah, so you can totally, oh, go ahead. 

Absolutely, yeah, and that's absolutely, and we're gonna have a lot of fun. In this file, do we have any garbage? 

Scroll down in there. 

In this file in the right, yes. 

Yeah, any encoded? 

Actually, no. 

Oh, you pasted it in one and not this one? 

Is that what happened? 

Nope. So let's try to do this. Let's try to do this. Is it just one file? 

Is it just one file that got left? 

That's what might be happening. 

Did you see? Yeah. Yep. 

Encoded. Yeah. I see. I remember. Because you pasted the whole thing once. Yep. 

You can. You can. You could also try to completely unselect everything and then make a selection. There's all kinds. Yeah. Because I don't think that's a permanent bug. 

Yeah. 

Well, you could delete. 

You could delete the flattened repo file. 

You could. 

Yes. 

Delete should work. 

It's fine. 

It'll. Yeah. Well, hold on. Are you sure? Yeah. Are you sure there's no bugs? 

Sort by file type, if it isn't. Yeah, that's fine. Cool. Fingers crossed. Okay. Looks good. 

Yes, this is your PDFs. This is all good. Yep. 

This is expected behavior. 

Yes. Oh, is it getting errors again? Or is that old? Okay, don't stress me. Okay. Yeah, docx errors I can handle, because that's expected, but more? 

Yeah, see? See, there you go. See? This is it. This is it. That's the 

yes it does when you see it yep so everything yes yeah yeah I wouldn't delete the files just because that's what you called it in your interaction schema unless you want to rename it to flattened repo because you're just tagging things and right now this is all tagged files okay the reason why I put it at the bottom is because I would put a little tag I would write ASDF So I would do a Control -F, ASDF, and the ASDF was at the top of where the files start. So I could just hold Control -Shift and press End, and it would select everything down in one keystroke. So once you delete it, I'll help you, I'll help you do it. I'll help you do it once you delete. You're up there, right there, right there, right there. There it is, delete all that. 

All the way up to the top. Now hold on, hold on, click at your line. Now hold on, I'll help you out, help you out. Hold on, let go. Click, just click right there, yep, exactly. And then now hold Shift and Control and press End. 

Oh, no. Are you on a Mac? What is this? No, you're Windows. Hold on. Yeah, it works. 

Yeah. Shift. Yeah. I just did it. It does it. 

It does the thing. 

It's supposed to. It's supposed to hot. Okay, whatever. 

Whatever. You can now. Okay, that's fine. Leave that there. Oh, no, no, no, no. I understand. 

E -N -D. E -N -D. Not the letter N. The button. Yes. Yes. Above the keyboard. 

Yeah, there it is. And then now, there you go. That was quicker. And then, yeah, you just deleted, the only thing you deleted was the files, but that's okay, that's okay. You can delete it as well up here and we'll fix it permanently so you never have to worry about it. Before you, yeah, before you paste it in, we wanna do one thing. 

Go back to where it was. Delete the last three lines. Don't paste it in just yet. Go ahead and delete the last three lines. Yep. Now, so just one point before we move forward. 

You're removing the files tag. And we're just replacing it for simplicity with the flattened repo. But before you paste it in, right at the top, you want to type in ASDF. ASDF. Just so you can trust me. And then below that, you can press enter. 

And now you can paste in your flattened repo. 

Because this is the manual process, the pasting. 

So it's quick if you can just control F, ASDF, you'll jump right to that spot. yeah that's that's it promise that's the fastest way i found to do this that's the one thing i will yeah explain yep yep and then you just control shift end to the bottom and then paste yep easy easy peasy yep that's it that's easy straight most yeah and then yeah so basically we can send so here's the fun part here's the fun part because once you're ready to send your prompt You're gonna see the response and you can see how it vibes with you. Once you read it, you're gonna realize, I should have asked for this, I should have asked for that. You can just change your cycle zero. 

Just change your cycle. 

Ah, so everything in your prompt file, prompt markdown. 

I would not give it the file. 

And the reason why is because they will do all kinds of trickery. They will parse and slice and contextualize the shit out of files. If you don't worry about any of that. Yep. Right there. And just paste it in right there. 

Yep. You can run that and do a second one. Yep. Go ahead and send it and then just duplicate your tab. Let's just do it. Well, let's just see. 

Let's just see. Let's just see. 

And then that's it. 

You give guidance based on it. It's see it. Listen, listen. You're building the mental model of the model right now. You're getting an idea of what one. 

So this is an important analogy. Think of your prompt as an input output as a single page because it reads and produces every token, but even its output. 

So after it produces, starts producing output, every time it produces a new token, it's rereads everything behind it. Again, every time it rereads everything, every time you see something pop up, it's rereading everything before it. all right so it it depends every um so for that reason if you just conceptualize it as one big page both the input and the output then what you're doing is you're you're you're building a new alphabet because you now know what the input will produce the output and that's one page like one japanese letter okay so what do we have yes and if we do yes, I wouldn't. Yeah. This is trash. 

Honestly, this is trash. This is experimenting because once we get real context, then you're cooking. Yes. But this is, you're, you're building the mental model of the model right now. Yes. It does do a search and you can turn that on or off on the right. 

Do you see grounding with Google search on the right? You can turn that on or off if you want. Yeah. You can do that as well. Do you see URL context? So if you give it a URL and you turn that on, it'll, it can read the URL. 

What's on the URL as well. So you can be more controlled about it. In your cycle, you would link something in your cycle and then it would read it. Oh, you can make an artifact that's just those links. That's a good idea. Now, just really quick, one caveat is not all websites are machine readable. 

Like for example, especially a website that's like an app where you have to navigate within an app and like click certain things to see database records. Because it's web crawler, they're just basic web crawlers. Yeah, good. Yeah, more or less flat static content. They're good old -fashioned web crawlers. It's not like an AI is intelligently looking at the website you gave it. 

yes sir so yeah yeah yes right yes and that's okay it's your first project yes this is good mm -hmm and then you can check a project as you task switch yeah you have to see it you have to see it you've gone from zero experiential blindness to oh dude I've been wanting to do this let me go ahead keep talking I'm gonna put put together a minor Mm -hmm. Yes. Mm -hmm. Let me, let me give you some guidance. Let me go ahead. 

I know what you would want. This is where your interaction scheme is going to come into play because you're going to need to specify, give me outputs as artifacts. And then that's where you, and I've already written it out. And that's where you just say, artifacts are enclosed in these tags that have the name and that's it. That's basically it. And then that is what the site, instead of what it gave you, it would have given you something with the name of it on it. 

And you can decide if I like this artifact, is this something I want to iterate on in the future, or is this garbage? I want to give it more guidance now that I know what this prompt is going to create. I'm going to share my screen. So what I've been doing is type, okay, so right above cycle zero. put a return, make a space in between. Yep. 

Now write cycle zero response. Yep. Yep. We'll copy, yeah. Cycle zero response. And then copy that, put that in brackets and carets, open greater than, less than. 

Yeah, just follow my lead. Yep. Just, yep. Put it in between, just like you're creating a new tag. Yeah. There you go. 

and then now copy that whole line and then paste it so you have two of them. 

No, no, no, just the one you just created, yep. 

Below it, right below it. 

Correct, correct. 

You're just, yep. 

And now, so assuming you're doing multiple responses, you're gonna choose one that you like, that you vibe with the most. 

Or you're just doing one, but that's the response, you put the whole response in there, minus any artifacts, because you take the artifact out and you put it in your file, so you don't have duplicates. your control X when you cut it out of the response from your notepad, right? Notepad++, maybe, was it? Or no, was it? You can copy it back again. 

It should be down in your AI studio. 

Yes, because you send your cycle 0, and then cycle 0 response comes back. In there, it should have artifacts that are enclosed. 

You cut those out, the ones that you like, because you've selected the response. 

You cut those out, and you put those in the actual artifacts, or you're creating new artifacts, and then you take the whole response, like what Gemini said to you, oh, this is what your blah, blah, blah, blah, and you just paste that in here. So you're creating an audit trail, almost, Yep, that basically yeah, so yep, so copy the whole thing and actually don't use this button Don't do that that way because it automatically doesn't mark down if you do it this way you see the hook Yes, click that and then copy it. Yes. Yes now put that in notepad plus plus No, I would do notepad plus plus in the middle ground. It's your live. Yes. 

It's much easier It will be I will create an interface for you. But for now, I would use notepad plus plus Not no no in your response one. You're dumping it into response one over and over again because it's your response one It's your current response one. 

This is a working document. 

You never say this is ephemeral copy copy You know control a and control V to select all and paste over you don't need the old one anymore. 

Yes Control a and then control V. Yeah, there you go. Yep. Yep So now the only thing is did this actually encapsulate things in artifacts for you or no? Yeah, I don't think so either No, no, no. We are looking at it now. You can go... 

So I don't read it in here. It's so much easier to read the responses in Notepad++. I don't read it in here. Yeah. I don't know why. It's easier. 

It's much easier. It did not. So that would be part of what you now know. Because it's like you see the future. You're literally seeing the future. Let me explain. 

Hindsight is 20 -20. You now know what your cycle zero will produce. You didn't know that. Okay, do you see my screen? Do you see what that is? 

Can you tell me what that is? 

Yeah, can you? 

Yeah, basically, it's almost like a Rorschach test. 

Okay, I'm going to, I'm going to, you currently are in a state of experiential blindness, and I have the antidote. I'm going to cure you. Okay, are you ready? Are you looking at the screen? What is that? Well, you can clearly, now you can see the snake, right? 

You didn't have that experience. That split second of experience, you didn't have it. Now you have it. That's all it took. That one split second of experience. Okay. 

Okay. Okay. Yeah. Now you have the experience. Yes, sir. You're welcome. 

You're welcome. Okay. Yep. So you're, you're good to go. The only thing you would need to do is go. Now you, this is good to go to your interaction schema. 

I'm going to give you the one for the artifact. Yes. That's right. After cutting out the artifacts and putting them in my actual repo. Yes. Because you're growing the repo. 

So they would be in the tags. They would be. Again, this is, we've learned we need to give it the instruction about the artifact tags or else it won't do it. I've already written that in my prompt. I can share that with you. And you've already got an interaction schema section. 

You already have it. 

It should be at the very top. 

Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so this is my prompt. You would look at the interaction schema section, which is my main artifact three. So that's going to be right below my cycle overview. So you could write in your cycle overview, cycle zero, project initialization, just if you wanted to start building your cycle overview. 

But this is basically what you want to write. 

So I will give you the top two. It looks like that's all you need are these two, one that describes artifacts, And then one that describes that they are the sources of truth. 

Just two basically sentences, three total, four maybe max total. 

So I'll just send you that. And those can be yours. 

I would change them just a smidge. 

You'll see why. Because I referenced some Artifact 106 or something. 

You can just sort of, you know, like tweak it slightly for your use case. 

But that can be your Artifact 1 and 2. 

And then just send your, just add those two and send your Cycle 0 again. Let's just see. Let's just see. And then you can also ask for something as well. You could ask for a list of modules, you could ask for a design of some kind, and it'll come back as an artifact. That would be up, so that's gonna be, you can think of this like your system message, your system instructions in like a project, a chat GPT project. 

So you would be putting, let me see your screen again. 

Cause you would be putting those near the top. 

Let me get my share working again. 

Yes. 

Yep. 

So project plan, right up interaction schema a bit further. Okay. 

So actually, so you don't have one yet. 

So, um, oh wait, no, zero zero. So a zero and then project plan. What do I have it called? Hold on one second. One second. I see. 

I can fix it for you. Ah, because what you have called Interaction Schema, I have called Artifact Schema. And then if you change, yeah, old, that's old. If you just, no, no, I got an easier way to do it. If you just undo that, and then highlight Interaction Schema together, copy it, and then do a Control F. Oh, it's already, Control F is already open in the top right. Paste that in there, and then click the down arrow. 

See, this is helpful because if there's 50, you're learning. That's okay, but if there were 50, you're learning how to do it quick. So click the down arrow right there. I'm so sorry, the bracket to the left further. It's still in that section. Left a little bit more, just a smidge. 

A little bit more, a little bit more, a little bit, that one. This is replacing that. I didn't know, I didn't know you didn't know. I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know, sorry. Okay, yeah, that's what we're doing in this instance, yeah. That's right, and then, because you're gonna have a real interaction schema now. 

Yep, there's some but, there it is. and now you can actually put a real one in here build one out Yep, build one out for yourself. 

I'm gonna it'll be a little experiment for yourself a little Home homework homework. 

I would put it in between project plan and files list. 

You've already changed it No, you need to now create a new artifact It's not even an artifact because an artifact so start in the artifact schema section and look because that's a list I would do right below project plan. 

I would make a new line No, no, no. 

That is where it will go. 

But before you do it there, up even further. Because it's a self -refer... Even further. The line number three or four? You see, that's the self -referential list. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

It takes a minute. It takes a minute. Our interaction schema. Because that's how the AI and you will be interacting. Yep. Now you have a name for your tag. 

Copy that. You can copy the whole line. Yep. 

See? 

See, see, see? See, see, see? It's just tags and tags and tags, man. Tags within tags within tags within tags. Ugh. I... 

Yeah. Yeah, down one more. Nope, one more. There's a closing, the closing tag. No, no, no, you're under project plan. You gotta put an extra space, but yeah, below that, because you're still, no, you're riding inside the project plan right there. 

Now you're outside of the project plan. 

That's right. 

You were about to, weren't you? Yeah. Yes. 

Yeah. Paste that. 

There you go. 

Perfect. Perfect. Whatever it's doing. Yeah. Oh, is there a artifact at the tip at the, at the end of it? 

Yeah. 

Now in here, put those number one and number two. 

You've done it. 

You've created, you've created the, see, this was me doing, I did all this manually, bro. 

I built, you know, I fit over three freaking years, bro. 

So right, right there. And yeah, including the flattened repo as well. See, cause it says files. And in fact, we need to update that tag. 

We need, We need to, well, we need to update that tag. 

Remember we deleted it? You can call it flattenedrepo . markdown if you want, instead of files. Everything's in perfect order. 

I don't see, there's nothing wrong. 

Oh, I see that. 

I couldn't see, you're correct. 

But everything's good. 

Everything largely is good. I see that. 

I see that. 

I see that. I see that. Yep. Now, and right there, press enter and you can put what I gave you and then you can clean it. It's just barely like, don't reference 106 or whatever. Just I'll put a number one. 

Yeah, there you go. And then our documents. Yeah. 

Yep. 

That's it. That's literally the only change. Everything else is fine. So now I would just, now that, now that you have, you can think of something to ask if you want to add another sentence or two to the end of your cycle zero to please start with the word, please, not because it's polite, but because in, in English, what often follows the word please is a command. So that's what Sam Altman gets wrong when he says, stop being polite to the model. You're causing more tokens or whatever. 

No, it's not that you're being polite. 

It's simply that in parlance, English parlance, please do something. That's what comes after please. So it's trained to... You can say, you can just... Because we're giving it a whole shitload of context, aren't we? Where's the ask, dude? 

The AI is going to just say, where's the ask? What do you want me to do here? please oh okay please do this oh everything makes sense now here's where the ask is okay so please is useful for that purpose yeah please create some initial art of documentation artifacts for us to get started um precisely yep now that you're enhanced with some hindsight well you can just say directive colon is same shit. Initial planning artifacts so we can get started. 

Yeah. 

To help get started. 

Yeah. And then if you want to make a mention about help me solve the blank page problem, there's no reason not to say that. That's called metacognition. Metacognition is thinking about thinking. And that is the training data that is missing right now. And so you will be adding metacognition into your AI by simply writing this. 

It becomes your training data. Help me solve the blank page problem, exclamation point. Yep. 

Cause it's going to know you're talking about you. 

You're, you're the person having this problem. 

Metacognition level status. Okay. Uh, yeah, go ahead and remove the response. 

Yep. 

Yep. Yep. And remove the, uh, tag as well. Just so it's just not. Yep. Yeah. 

And you can copy it and then you're good to go. It honestly, I think it's valuable. Um, no, uh, actually yes as well. Um, yes. because you selected the response that you liked. Yep. 

And now's a good time. Yeah. Yeah. I'll get the docs working. No, that's it. You're going to get more organized and you're seeing how, what truly, what helps when you learn to use AI is it helps you cut through the fluff, cut through the extra garbage that is human garbage. 

Because we've been reading our own books, writing our own books with our own, you know, as good at English as maybe the dude's dyslexic. The dude's writing a book, nothing wrong with dyslexia, but now we have to read it. Right. So now the AI is going to write everything for us. That's good. We just have to validate it. 

It's seriously, this is, Peak future, bro. 

This is Star Trek level status. Did it wrap it as an artifact? 

That's what I want to do. 

I think so. It did. I saw it. Yep. So you would copy this out. Don't you see how messy it looks in here? 

I don't even know. Copy this out in our same process. Right there, the... Yep. Markdown. Copy as markdown. 

Put it in Notepad. And then, yeah. Now it should be clean and... Yeah. What do we have? How's it look? 

Oh, what you can do, what you can do, just do, see where the three backticks are? Just add three more backticks. Up at the top on line 19. Yeah, just add three more, or delete those. That's all, yeah. It's just that? 

Yep. There you go, see? Yes, sir. So you, read that, yeah, read through that. That you're building the picture of what's missing. You see how, you see? 

You see how the hallucinations tell you what's missing? I told you. It's easy. It's so easy, dude. This is so easy. Especially with the structure. 

Yes. Uh, yeah. Yeah, however you want to do it. Each one. Yes. 

And it's task -based. 

Hold on. It's task -based. And task can be like, I did the beacon course, and then I did the in -game course. That's the same task. So I just started at cycle 30 when I started to make in -game. I just said, now it's time to make in -game. 

You see what I'm saying? 

Yeah. Because it's the same task. It's the same task. I just started building new artifacts. Yeah. Yes. 

Every project gets simpler, bro. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. every time you restart a project structure yes sir because you had to take the lessons learned yet you haven't seen nothing yet yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's gonna be a fun hopefully i can build it soon before you have to worry about that, yeah. I'm gonna make it just a button eventually, dude, don't worry. 

Use this prompt, use this prompt. Cycle one, yeah. In cycle one, write it out in cycle one. Write it all out, bro, that's the gold. That's the golden information. Put it, say, now that, put in the response zero. 

Say, I've thought about what you've given me, I've thought about what I want, here's now what I think. Literally, put that's metacognition, that's the missing piece. then the AI will go to work for you, bro. But if it doesn't know what you want, truly, because you never truly told it, yep, it's the missing piece. That's a good question. Rarely do I do the alteration what we just did. 

That's very rare. Sometimes if it's easier or more beneficial, I will do that. But honestly, like 95 % of the time, I will not do that. I will just make a new cycle one, a cycle two, because my process makes it easy of where I should put this information. If you fall out of the process, you start editing cycles, you start realizing, oh, I've got this file. Where should I put it? 

Where does it go? Oh, God, I don't know where to put it. Should it go in this place? Should it go here? My process sort of alleviates all that. Once you realize where things should go, it's just like you put this here, you fall 

the next cycle. Oh, well, I now, I, I, okay. I now, it's the same thing with the now seeing the future. I now know what, where I'm at with the cycle. I know what this will produce. I can produce, just write a cycle one. 

I like, oh, especially, let me say it like this. The reason why I do the 95, it's 95, is because you just give feedback. It's all feedback. It's one big feedback loop, both for you and for it. You're giving it the feedback, and it kind of breaks down if you're just editing the same cycle. You're not quite giving it a full feedback, if that makes sense. 

If you could just continue through the cycle process, then you are truly giving it feedback, and that's the virtuous cycle when you're giving non -hallucinogenic feedback. You're the human in the loop, eliminating that hallucination. You'll be surprised how far you can get with just that little virtuous cycle. You're getting close to chain of thought. You're getting close to chain of thought reasoning. which is what cycle is doing. 

So the cycles are doing chain of thought. And so all I'm going to say is that sometimes you need to let it respond and then take its response and then process that which you didn't have before. So you can't, there are some steps you can't skip, right? Do you know about the program called Life? I forget the guy who wrote it, Carl Haraway or something, but Game of Life, basically the guy made on a grid a few simple rules the square is filled in if it's alive and this square is not filled in if it's dead and if it has Two neighbors then the third one will become alive as if reproduction and if there's just one alone it will die as if to starvation or whatever and just simple rules like three of those rules and then if depending on the initial starting conditions, you get these massive, amazing structures that come out of it. 

And you can even get like these living things that seem like organisms that can like produce objects and shoot out and travel and they can move and things like that. And it's called the Game of Life. And it's a very interesting, deep dive on Wikipedia. But the moral of the story of the Game of Life is that some calculations, you cannot get to the, you have to literally run the calculation. You just got to run it to see what the result will be. There's no skipping of the steps. 

So that's kind of what I feel is going on here. There are some of that you can consolidate. And I have done that when I did the beacon. And then when I did the end game, it was like 30 cycles to 10 cycles, because I knew where I was going wrong. And I knew I already had the cycles written. I could literally reference my own words, how I wrote it the last time. 

Now's the time to do the Excel document. How did I ask for it last time? Yeah, it's refining. Yes, sir. Yes. Me too, me too. 

It'll help you in dividends in the future, man. This is not just for work. This is amazing. Okay, take care, man. All right, bye.
