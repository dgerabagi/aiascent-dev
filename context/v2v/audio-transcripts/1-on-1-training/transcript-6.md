It's right here, right? 

Data curation environment. 

And I see, yeah, you have the new version installed. 

Cool. Okay. So this is the previous one. I kind of was going through and trying to create a simple one. So, I mean, honestly, it's going to be tough until I actually start implementing all the stuff in there and might reorganize it. But this is just the basics. 

So artifacts. project documents, but that doesn't include resources. So these are like possibly like things that I've created just to help get the project together that may be referenced or maybe not. These are resources based off of things that we want the AI to use as a learning resource to pull information, to build training upon, et cetera, et cetera. And then I have UKI templates, which is we would fill with all of our base templates, our references, training material, anything we have to do, follow along with, writing styles, etc. Right. 

So that's the basic. I was kind of messing around, but that's like the basic. 

And then this would be the product template. 

And then you just simply copy paste and then like browse and say this would be the MC doc. 

Right on. 

And then it has everything in there. Yep. Well, the biggest thing would be keeping like these all, at least the UKI, these are always going to be kind of dynamic to the project. 

These should be static. UKI templates also can, we can implement cause then project restart is like, okay, where are we going to put framework and stuff? They could probably be going under somewhere under UKI templates. Yeah. 

And we may even, we may even break it out beyond project template. 

There may be like lesson template. 

And like different project templates at over time. Yeah. 

Yeah. Yeah. 

So based off of what they're trying to design. 

Yeah. 

No, that's good. That's good. 

That's good. That'll work. 

Definitely. Um, we want, uh, we want to start, uh, getting whatever you need if you want to start working on gathering up the NC doc content. So I have it. Okay. Cool. Uh, well I don't have any inappropriate folders, but I have a bunch of cheap, you know, that's the thing was, If you just put them all understand more like what do you think is the best way sure for it to grab right? 

I would say let's start with everything that you're bringing in as a in a reference folder and just call it reference for now and then from there we can if we feel like something is like Fundamentally different then we'll branch it out but but I think initially as we're coming in just as the as initial like Level the playing field or all the it's like this all the facts on the ground, right? 

So here are all the facts on the ground of the current state of the project. 

And we ultimately, pie in the sky goal, we want it to look like this. So now let's start making all the planning artifacts that are going to get us there. 

And then from those planning artifacts, We'll get will glean some Organizational traits actually you'll see there's a thing that worried me, so I had like they're all Yeah, this is good. 

This is good. 

You're doing good. 

This is what we want. Yeah, no, but Before I was organizing it was based off the actual module that was in to kind of keep track Sure is we're gonna have a lot of resources in here. Yeah Oh, I see what you've done. Actually. 

Oh, okay. 

Okay. So I see. Okay. This is much better. 

So delete everything in reference documents and instead bring everything as a project in the project files folder, I believe, as I see what you're doing. 

And then that way we'll keep your structure, but then we're still getting like everything, like I said. So put that. 

Yep. 

So now we're on the right. Go out at some directories. I want now I got to sit on the right. Yes. This is just my old stuff. Oh, so I saw you were... 

Okay, okay, go ahead. 

Yeah, this is what I just currently have, but the left side is where I was trying to redesign the folder structure for the VS Code. 

Okay, what I'm... 

Unless you think it's good to break them up into the different lessons within the project. 

I do think it's fine, especially if this is the Module 1 resources that will be going for the NC... Yeah, for the NC Dock that we're doing. 

On the right, then that's the metadata that you've already sort of organized that we can gain from if you keep that directory structure when you drag it over to the left. That was my mistake. I didn't understand you had them sort of organized in. folders. And that all we need to do now is just sort of move all of those files into your VS Code directory. Right. 

Well, this is the old directory I had, but I think it got too complicated. Oh, OK. So that's why I was trying to create a new one. So this is the old one that we created. with the flattened repo and everything. 

Got it. Thank you. And this is the new one. So I was trying to simplify it where you just have a template folder. 

Yeah. 

Where basically all you're going to do is when you have a new project, you copy and paste this folder and then rename it. And then it has everything. It should have everything in here. I don't really have any templates in here right now, but project I could use. 

Actually, I could, for example, I could use this is the combined technical writing training prompts I already give. Yeah. 

Yeah, I think that's the split we need, just the UKI templates and then all the resource documents. 

And then the resource documents, obviously, CUI, not CUI. And then non -resource, you can drop all your module 1, module 2, module 3, project docs, resources, just literally just knowledge dump it all into. Yeah, well, I kind of did that, but I did all in one. That's OK. 

That's OK. 

Honestly, it'll probably be just fine actually now that I think about it a second time. 

It'll actually probably be I'm probably over complicating it It's probably just fine this way because we'll build it out over time and it's gonna pick and choose What it needs for any given? Yeah, and that's why I'm saying it might as I'm going through and I'm noticing it then I might say hey You know, it's picking too many other references I don't need. Oh, I don't think I don't think it will I think we're gonna be giving it the guiding principles in terms of like we're we've are where you me and Alex we're spelling out what's going in module 1 module 2 module 3 and it will adhere to that and then so it'll pull from everything you've concocted wherever you have put it and it will Organize it. 

Okay. 

Yeah I mean, that's kind of all the resources and then going back to project documents, but that would be more these things here that are like things I've created and just like, you know, for instance, what was the new one? 

Actually, let me pull like in here would be, we could be the KSA, the ELOs. Let me get the updated from the channel one, throw that in there. Sure. 

Yeah. 

Where's the NC doc, project NC doc. Files data map and love that. Yeah, the thing I've found that causes issues is when you give like maybe two lists of casettes in KSAs in your in your list and you're not paying attention to that That's where it might pull from one or the other or might update one or not the one you're thinking other than that Other than having like duplicate information That's all that's been what I've seen that kind of trips it up. Yeah, I'll just throw this in here because this has them all and So that would be like a project document, but we could also, if we want, well, we're going to have to, we could set it up. 

project documents. 

Okay. Okay, so go ahead and if this is, um, we can close this, close this project because you won't, it's, it's basically VS code that's new. Uh, it shows the changelog now. Um, you can just exit this because, um, I have another way to open the workspace or you, unless you know a way to do it, you want to do it your way. Are you talking about opening the new? Yeah. 

Yeah, this will work too. 

This will work just fine. 

Yep. So then now, what we can do first is check. I'm going to delete this one though. 

You don't have to. 

You can actually. It is garbage. Go ahead if you want. It'll refresh. It just takes a second. If you click refresh, it might show up. 

Refresh Explorer. Let's try this again. Delete. Are you sure you want to delete items? 

Yes. Failed to delete items. 

Oh, okay. Okay, then just do it in the Explorer manually. Yeah, I didn't. Doing those things is a bit more difficult. No, no, I'm sorry, no, no, no. Over on the left, no, on the far left, it's the top tab on the activity bar, they call that. 

Yep, you can just right click there and it's gonna work here. It's probably just a permissions issue. You probably need elevated permissions to delete a file and my extension doesn't have it. There we go. Oh, there we go. Yeah, now you can go back. 

Yeah, now you can go back to the other. The bottom one, the spiral. So there you're just going to check. Now you can check the box on the left and then you basically won't have to worry about that. I've even cleaned that up and made that better. That's going to check everything that you've added. 

Ah, so okay. So check the sizes. Okay. 

So it looks like there's only one file that's going to cause you a problem, which is this top one. It's just too damn big. it's pushing you over the limit, because if you see at the very bottom right of the selected items, yep, you're at 1 .22, and basically our hard cutoff for AI Studio is one million. Okay, so maybe it would be better to probably break some of these up? No, not quite, because we only need a few hundred thousand tokens free for us at a given time. 

So let's click on just the top one, that NIST one. Can you click on it? It doesn't display PDFs in here. Okay, so you know what? We might not need to bring in the NIST stuff. Uh, the, the more like the, the cookie cutter, like the whole NIST thing itself, unless like we're actually needing to reference specific, uh, like this, uh. 

It references it in our training. 

Like actually like one item, like we need to know this X dot X dot X in the NIST guidelines or whatever. Uh, well, it's from some of the ELOs, it's referencing these instructions and pulling information out of the instructions. A lot of these, the JP2, JP312 is a big one. Yeah, it's a lot of going along with... we can, we can, well, when we flatten it, it's going to make it smaller. Nope. 

Nope, nope, nope. 

So that would be, um, a different making it small quote unquote would be a, uh, rag process. 

You would have to create an embedding, which is definitely doable. And it would be literally in the, uh, wheelhouse of the on the fly tooling. I'll just take this out for now. Yes, that would be what I recommend for now. And then guess what? Whenever you do need to drill down into that, um, uh, task where you actually require, you know, you require that document. 

You can just de -select and re -select the things you also don't, you know, you don't need for that task. Right. In this list. Yeah. Gotcha. Yep. 

But for now, that was it. That's it. 

So just with that one de -select now, if we look, it says 543. Oh, you even made a couple more. 

So that's yeah, that's perfectly fine. 

And you honestly, 80 ,000 tokens is a hell of a lot. So we so you know, you can even if you're up at 900 ,000, you could still work with that just just for the just for reference. 

Right. But yeah, so now you've got a great selection of content to work with. Now over here on the right, you can draft your language. And if I would preempt something, let's just go ahead and maybe let's do it in a notepad. I've had a colleague lose data in between because you know it takes 5 -10 minutes to write something in here tab switch back and forth and they lost what they wrote in this particular window let's just do it in a notepad just what we know I don't want you to lose anything in this in this in this meeting yeah it's just the same thing it's just we're just going to be writing so you had this before oh yeah that's right we didn't we the next the tab over every time yeah every time you install a new notepad 

So we have this. 

This is what you gave me. 

Okay. Okay. 

Okay. 

This was the previous one that kind of helped update. 

We actually kind of use this for designing a new ELO. Okay. So I think the best thing to do would be if this document does, okay. The best thing to do would be to just basically give a 30 ,000 foot view of what the task is and then give the line item a list item of the modules and what the modules and the labs are going to consist of. 

I believe those two items in this project plan are the perfect two items to put in the project plan. 

And we may have them both right in this document or may just need slight modifications. Yeah, this was more... Or is it old? Also update the master artifact list to include these new documents. So it's probably going to reference documents that are no longer in there. Yeah, so maybe the high level, we can take its high level language and then when it's talking... 

Based on your request, I just started creating cybersecurity training. Oh, there is a WordRap button. 

It is right under the PN plugins in the top. Yep, right down, left one. 

That one. 

Yeah. 

Now, whatever size it is, you'll be able to read. 

So it's based on your request to get started though, but this was like halfway through. That's okay, so check it out. 

Yeah, so see the number one is the high level and then the number two... 

the design level document. So all you would probably need to do is just scroll down and just edit this document and delete the, where it gets too specific, just straight up delete only the parts where it's like this file, this folder, just delete those, which I don't see yet. 

And the modules should be fine. Um, there's some, there's some document names right there. Yeah. 

I see. 

It's documents. Well, wait a minute. 

Quick question. 

Are those documents? is still in your directory, just in a different directory? It's in a different directory. Yeah, then maybe just delete the path, but leave the filename. Because if those filenames are in your... it's perfect. Well, the thing is too, is we have a created document. 

I'd rather just kind of start from scratch a little bit, because we have the document now that has basically the output of that structure it gave us. Um, which would be referenced here under project. Sure. Uh, okay. Then if that's the case, I have a good project template under, uh, project documents. That's right here. 

Okay. 

Then maybe then let's do one thing. 

Let's split your, a notepad plus plus right. 

Click on that new one, that new, uh, one tab at the tab. 

It says new one. 

Yep. 

And then where are we at? Let's see. Move document at the bottom at the second to last at the bottom, and then move, move to other view. And then now you can max, now you can. 

That should be a way you can look at that one and then write a new document. 

It doesn't have the original request in here. It just has... Do you want the original? request? I can maybe try to find that prompt. 

Weird. 

Why is this not? It would be a couple of weeks ago. Yeah. This was the response I gave. So what are we supposed to be giving here? We're basically giving it the directions. 

Yep. We're basically getting the starting point. We are saying to the AI, look, here are all these documents. My plan is I'm going to be making training for NC DOC, blah, blah, blah. I'm just going to go ahead and start. You totally can. 

Yeah, because this is going to be... My only fear, yeah. It's going to take longer to try to recreate or... I understand. No, believe me, I understand. I've written many, many papers. 

It's a struggle. The struggle is real. I'm with you. So if I want to reference the document in here? You totally can. Just do it by document name and I would do it in, just to be crystal clear, is putting tilde quotes, like a tildes. 

I mean, yeah, honestly, just the telling it what it's doing and then giving it the modules are basically the two things to get started. 

that's going to be able to pull them efficiently out of those names. 

You know what? I think it will be. I think you're right on both accounts. It is less efficient, but it also will be because I've done the same thing. What I've done is I had a project scope and it was just a project scope, like a raw text. And then I actually made a artifact to become project scope. 

And then in that project scope, I just referenced, I said, see artifact, whatever, and just moved on. Life was fine. So you're essentially doing the same thing. 

You're referencing the Excel document as a tag in your project scope. 

I think it'll be just fine. Yeah, I'll just throw them in here. I don't want to take too long. Yeah, also, yeah. No reason. 

I believe it'll still be more efficient if it's right there in front of it, but I've seen it both ways, and I think this is better ultimately. 

Generate initial artifact prompts we could are there any initial? Documents that you know you'll want like in terms of planning artifacts like We can let it yeah, we can I was just wondering you can one final second You can click generate initial artifacts prompts at the bottom, and then it'll we want to just check check on the okay Yeah, so I can see so there's just one thing yep Go ahead and click Flatten Context as well, because it did not create this file, which it did just now. 

All you'll need to do, and you only have to do it this one time for the initial cycle, is select all in this file in the flattened repo. 

Oh, and also, first, let's scroll down through here and make sure everything looks fine. 

Let's go on the right, and you can click in the flattened repo on the on the right on that uh what do they call that the file navig file navigator i think that what your mouse is yep click on the actual screen part at the top it's like highlighted the part that's highlight yes if you click there and you drag it you can actually drag it nicely quickly through the whole file from top to bottom versus if you did it another way there's no way to do it so click and drag down and yeah we're doing it so we're just looking we're looking for any like raunchy 

nasty, broken symbols. Yeah. 

Yeah. 

Yeah. Text is good. Even if it's like one letter at a time, who cares? It doesn't, doesn't even that's fine. That's fine. That's actual, it's content. 

It's like, yeah. 

Encrypted. Yeah. 

Hashed garbage. Yeah. Gotcha. Yep. 

Okay. 

No, it looks like it looks like we're Gucci. Um, which is good. Okay. So just copy everything in there. And again, you're only going to have to do this one time. This is just the initial. 

I didn't remember to fix this. Now go into your prompts file. It's the fourth tab. Prompts . md. Yeah, you can open it there as well. 

This one? Nope, that one. Now here, if you look in the artifact schema right at the top, you're going to be dropping this, what you just copied into M7, which is the flattened repo. So that'll be basically the very bottom. It should be empty. 

Yep, there it is. 

You can just put it right above that line. 

Right above. Yeah, because that's the ending tag. If you see that's a slash in front of the M. So above it is it. Yeah. So just push enter and right there. Just paste it. 

Just fine. Life is good. You're done. 

You're done. 

You're done. 

Now copy this whole thing. 

And now you can send this to, uh, uh, uh, AI studio. 

I think so. 

Look now that's a massive 41 ,000 lines. Yeah. Yeah. It's in there. Yeah. Yeah. 

Yeah. You're good. Okay. 

Is that right down at the bottom? 

It's fine. 

File structure. 

I believe it's fine. 

I do believe it's fine. 

Yes, it's just fine because OK, yeah, because those are all the template artifacts above it. that I put in from my, yeah, yep. All right, are we just saving this? Yeah, you can, and then copy it all out. Oh, the whole thing, okay. Yeah, and then now go to your AI studio, and now it's time to let it cook. 

Oh, so now we're just putting this in an AI? Yeah. What, we're doing Gemini? 

Yeah, Gemini probably can't take it, AI studio. 

Oh, AI. Gemini has harder token limits than this one. 

Over on the right, just do a nano, click on nano banana, change it to 2 .5 pro. 

And then, yep, that's already done. Just do the temperature to 0 .7. And then if you want to clone, right click this tab and clone it, duplicate it. You want to do two or three replications. How many do you want to do, two, three, four? Yeah, that's fine. 

Okay. And then just, yeah, double check just the temperature and then send it off. Give it a man, really? 

Nope, that's okay. 

That's okay. A lot of it will come after when we see what the results are. That'll help us get into the state of flow. And then also one thing that is important is we wanna also show it what the end product will look like. Obviously we don't have this end product, we're making it. But if we have another end product that is able to be added as just its own artifact, as its own document, and saying, look, this is what, you know, like if I were to like give my introduction to Beacon class, I don't know, I actually, maybe that would be in line or not. 

But yeah, so we're making lessons. 

It's going to be in Confluence, right? And then, okay, then nevermind, I'm over complicating it. Yeah, it's not being saved yet. 

It's fine. If it's just Confluence and Markdown, then it'll produce, then all you got to do is ask for it in Markdown. And then it's literally a copy paste job into Confluence. We need this in markdown. Nope. Oh, yes. 

So go ahead and put your mouse over on the top. There's the ellipsis and then copy as markdown. You'll do this three times. Now go to the tool, our extension, our VS code. Yeah. And then go to the, so you've got two parallel co -pilot tabs. 

Um, we just, we're just going to need one over on the left and close this co -pilot chat on the right. That's going to give you more window. Yeah. More really. more screen real estate. All right, where are we going now? 

Sure, the tabs on VS Code DC Parallel Copilot, you've got two of those tabs open. Yeah, probably close that one. Yeah. Okay, in here, now see the blue? That's where you're going to be putting your responses, but also since you're doing three replications, let's just change responses in the top right from four to three. I see what you're saying. 

Yep. 

Okay, now - My response is here. 

Yep. It'll auto -tab, so it just auto -tabbed for you. So now you can just copy the next one. That was one of the new additions is auto -tabbing. There you go. Okay, now we click parse all at the top and then we click sort on the right. 

And it shows us that the third response was the longest and it gave us one extra file. 

Click on response three. That's right, that's right. And then so, yeah, so read the summary. training platform project, establish comprehensive set foundational planning documentation artifacts, blah, blah, blah, clear blueprint. Yep. So course of action, create the master artifacts, vision goals, scouting plan, testing guide, repo guide roadmap. 

So let's go through the vision and goals and then the roadmap first, because if those aren't aligned, nothing else is important. So scroll up on the left and then click on, actually we can just, uh, so, okay. Yeah. Scroll up on the left and then click on, um, I'm sorry. Um, let's do this as well. Click the spiral. 

That'll give us more screen real estate. Yep. Now scroll up in the, uh, yeah. Cool. Cool. Perfect there. 

So let's click on the second file, the project vision and goals. It's the red, see the red circles, the red Xs. Yeah. The red X means that project doesn't exist in your, so it's a new file. Yeah. See, and you hover over, you get the full file name. 

Yep. I guess I truncated a little too, a little too aggressively. Yeah. So here, Vision, NTDoc, training platform. I don't know if it's a training platform. It's just a, it's just a, it's just a set of modules. 

So we, ah, aha. Oh my God. It knows what PCTE is. so that'll be so let's say put that in your cycle context so let's click up there uh that's amazing uh watch yeah uh in the cycle context uh con uh yeah up there in the uh it's a text window yep so right here you can say uh just say this training will be for the pcte and just period um because uh Are you trying to comment? Are you adding? Yeah, preface that sentence. It'll make sense after you preface that sentence. 

So go to the front of the sentence and I'm going to put why I'm saying that. Yeah, so in the project vision artifact, 

You reference this training as a platform. 

We're not making a platform, we're making a training. And the platform we're making the training for is the PCTE. That's gonna help align things overall. Yeah, perfect. Okay, and then so we can keep reading. Project will be developed to phases or... 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, also, so are we making, you're just making the lessons, lesson content, correct? 

So let's say, That as well. 

This is going to solve the other problem I was facilitating on earlier. At the end of your sentence, write this. The final deliverables will be output in Markdown. The expected final output deliverables will be in Markdown. That's fine. Get it out first. 

Will be in Markdown format. That's one of the things. You have to tell it what it is you want the end product to even look like, or else you'll just be kind of grasping at straws, which is a state of being, actually. Sometimes that's the way to go, is when you don't know what the end result should be. You have to just kind of grasp at straws, and then you can build a vision. Okay, so that's good. 

That's what we want there, and now it knows what the end product should look like. that's why I was trying to go for a platform, because it kind of didn't really know what the end result was gonna be. So that's good. And then we were, so it's all about the training. 

So we're here for the training. 

So then now let's look at the roadmap, the file, the last file on the list. Oh yeah, just click on it. The check mark will do something next. Yeah, just click on it to view it. Yeah, let's see what, core UI to see UI development. So that's going to align this drastically. 

So I don't think we need to say anything more. I think let's say with that notion, please review and revise our artifacts. Back in the cycle context? Yep, precisely. So with that in mind or with that notion, please update our documentation artifacts. And then before we move on, but then we're done with that. 

So we could literally just send that off again, but let's just check another artifact. Let's just check another response. Let's just be a little scientific -y and see, click on response two, because it's almost the same. It's six files as well. Yep. So let's check its vision. 

Oh, this one might be more aligned. This is calling it a training curriculum project and not a platform. This might be more in line with what we want and we might not. So let's just check this one out. Check out the Vision and Goals, the second document. Yeah, we will do the GitHub. 

That's important. That helps you really compare different results later. 

Okay. 

So here, training curriculum is to create the, it's again, it's going for a platform. Okay. Okay. 

Platform scaffolding. 

Let me just read. 

Yeah. User authentication. See, see, yeah, that's where it's getting confused. Okay. So then we can go, go to response three. I just wanted to confirm. 

Now you just want to click select this response over a ride a little bit. What that does is that expresses your intent that this is the response that we're going to be going with. You can also see at the top right it says baseline. 

You can click that and then it's going to give you an error because you haven't initialized yet. So go ahead and click baseline and then down there you can click initialize and then Nick's initialized. Now you can click baseline again. You can now create a baseline it says. Okay so now you're baselined which If you were to test multiple responses and you didn't like what you just tested, you could click Restore right next to it to go right back to this baseline. But now you can click Select All, which is right next to what's highlighted to the right. 

So that's what the checkboxes on the left do. You say, I want this file in my repo. Now you click Accept Selected. Now it turns red. 

That's just because it's a Similarity it's compared to what it was. 

It's 0 % similar because it's brand new, but that's fine So now you can click the spiral on the left now We can open our file tree up again. And now those files will be in our source artifacts. So click that It's not in there. You can click and we'll drag it in there. Okay it's in there right there. 

Source up a bit. Yeah, it puts it in there, but we can select them all and drag them in. If you, if you want, it's no big deal. It doesn't matter where they are. Is this going to be the automatically created this artifact folder? It did. 

But I think that if you move them, it'll just treat it just fine. But again, I think it's arbitrary where, where it is. Um, so do you technically don't have to create an artifact folder in the beginning? No. It will definitely do that for you. It's programmed to do that. 

And now I don't like, what I would love it to do is to do the one that you wanted it to. That would be, that's going to be like refinement on my part. It just puts it in Sork Artifacts, but you're free to move it. It's, it's, it's the next time you do flatten. Oh, that's fine. 

I keep it here. 

If we don't need to create it then. Yeah, I agree. 

I agree. 

It's, it's perfectly fine right there. Um, and it'll, and it won't break anything. Uh, and largely it's, it's yeah. 

It's tagged with artifacts, which is what's more important, really. 

Yep, so we got those files, and then it's going to basically fix them. So now go back to your Parallel Copilot tab. Yep, now we can, oh, okay, so now you just need to new cycle, let's put the title, new cycle, let's just name it Refine Project, colon, we're not making a platform, we're making training curriculum, or semicolon, colon, whatever. comma q c r c u r r Curriculum. Yeah. 

Okay. Now we can click. So let's do it. Let's, uh, over on the right, do you see the cloud with the arrow up? It's the third button, the third little icon. Yep. 

Save cycle history. So this is just, uh, my personal process is, um, I saved this and I do it outside of this directory. So it doesn't get automatically at actually, I think I just updated it. So yeah. 

just so you have it saved so you don't lose your hair if you lose your cycles. But I have made it more robust. I haven't lost my cycle since I fixed it. 

Now you've got the new version. But yeah, just do that once right before now. 

Now you're going to just click Generate Prompt because you've got your cycle one, you've got your new files. 

Now just over on the top left, you're going to click Generate Prompt MD. Up a bit more. Yep. 

So now this time you don't have to do any other copying. Now it's going to do it for you. Now now scroll up to the top. 

You should see your new cycle one if you hold a control and press home It'll oh cool. 

Yep. 

See so now it's here It's all updated everything put everything right in the right spot where it needs to be Now all you've got to do is copy and paste it into your into your AI studio This is what you're hoping to have like a plug -in to have it do it automatically. That's right And it will it I if you actually open the settings I'm working on that part now I just need, that's right, what's his face, needs to give us an API key, and then absolutely, this will be literally just, you click, instead of, when you click generate prompt, they'll just come into the responses. 

Right. 

Yeah. 

And as many as you asked for. 

Yeah. 

and it will even give you a cost so you can estimate your cost whatever yeah so yeah so now delete this is the manual but this is also free so anything else would be an API cost okay so am I just doing a whole new chat for this you can either do that or you can delete the three messages on the right I if you do if you do a new chat it'll be you just reset your temperature oh yeah I haven't used Google AI studio very much. I'm trying to understood just posting it back down in here But what am I asking you that this are it's gonna just go through the cycles and basically that update I just did it's gonna redo it all so do you see your? Token count at the top. It's at five hundred fifty six. 

We're five hundred fifty six thousand We're gonna need to delete the prompt you've sent. 

Oh, okay. Here's an idea Oh, you've actually given me a faster way to do it instead of deleting the top one edit the top one So you see the edit button right there? It's a less, it's less, so mouse where you're just mouse was again. And then the, the, the, that, um, now, now, now, yes, I will. That's going to be less keystrokes overall. Uh, it's a, it's up a bit. 

Yeah. It's that window up a bit. It's moves. I hate, I hate it. Yeah. There it is. 

Control a, uh, to delete. 

Yep. And then this is less keystrokes. I promise you than any other option. Um, it says user. Yeah, there it is. You got to select in their user. 

Oh, there you go. It wasn't, like, propagating. There we go. Now the double -check mark. 

Double -check or the actually, yeah, double -check to save this. 

Edit. Think slow. Yeah, I see that. Maybe this isn't faster if this is the performance of the edit functionality. Jeez, Google. 

Let's see if it does it here. Yeah, it's very tweaking out. It's not like this. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's just best to delete. Right on. 

Experiment failed. It did finally look like it updated this one, but. Yeah, you can tell if it says cycle one. 

God dang it. I don't know what it's doing now. Yeah, I've used AI Studio since the beginning and boy, oh boy, was it different. This is better. This is good. What it's doing now is an improvement, sadly. 

I'm just gonna delete this. Yeah, yeah, we're done with it. And in fact, they're saved in our cycles now, which is something I've never had. Now that we've got our cycles, every response I've ever had, and I've done it before, I've gone back two cycles and it loaded a file. Just because I remembered I had it back there. 

I'm like, oh yeah. Yep, delete it again. So there's three. 

There's your message, and then it does a thinking step, and then it does its response. 

Yep, there's the thinking. And actually for you, for you, yeah, it doesn't save anything at all because of your settings. 

So you can probably just do a new chat, but it's still, you have to do your temperature one way or the other. You're gonna have to change some settings. Oh, wait, I didn't change the temperature. 

It's OK. 

It's only a little difference in the efficacy. I've looked at some statistics. 

The performance goes up marginally, like overall at 0 .7. And then it starts to go back down at 0 .6, 0 .5. 

But they're all largely the same. Yeah, see, it didn't know what our, and that's exactly, that's amazing. It tried to make a platform because I'm giving it all these code templates, which You can take my extension, you can write a book with it, you don't have to make code with it. 

Cool, yeah. And then telling it we just want them in Markdown is like, oh, now I know what it's supposed to look like. All right. You might even, hell, depending on how good you're, if you've got all the documents, literally, this is it. It's A plus B equals C. If you've got all the right resource documents that it's gonna need in your request and you ask for it, you're gonna get it in the output. Then it's just a matter of, let's do module 1, let's do module 2, let's do module 3. 

If they're too big, then you break it up. 

Let's do module 1 .1, let's do module 1 .2. I think this is a good example. 

I'm past this point, obviously, in the NCDoc phase, but I'm just learning it. I think it'd be better. if we like went, this would be good or great in the beginning. 

And then you're going from there and be like, okay, well now I want to, I don't want it to build out all of the modules at once. I think it'd be too broad. And then, you know, I think if you focused on one modules, you know, Hey, this is, this is the ELOs I'm trying to accomplish. And this one, you know, you know, referencing back to the drives again, is this done? Yeah, that's good. No, you're right. 

That's exactly the process. And I always start high level first because you never know what you're going to get. You don't know what the current model can do. 

And then any part you just drill into, you can refine. Yeah. 

Okay. So now you just need to click the check mark, which is just to the left of the cycle title. And in the future, it'll be highlighted for you as you get through the workflow. Just to the right, a little bitty bit. You're almost there. 

Yeah. 

In the future, as you go through, it'll be highlighted just like the blue. It's just whatever, yeah, whatever reason. Yeah, I was gonna say, I mean, everything seems to be working good. It's just trying to navigate. There's a lot going on. There are, and it'll get more fluid, and you're getting more into the, Workflow now there was the initialization that you're done with now now It's this rinse and repeat that paste in the responses click the parse and you won't even need to do the sword again You just click parcel. 

Oh, where is that over here? Yeah, they should do Feel like if you are doing everything down here the parcel button should be like I can like I can be like right around here Or me. Yeah, I can. Yeah, I'm with you. I'm with you. Yeah, this one. 

Yeah, because this looks like it's part of... I think you're right. 

I think you're right. 

It doesn't look like a butt. This looks like a... You know what I mean? Yeah, I think you're right. I think maybe over by sort or maybe sort should be over on the left as well. Because if you're doing this, you're adding it in. 

You put all this stuff in. Or maybe on parts all should value be down here. Like, you know, I just put in all the information maybe like right up here. trying to keep you within the cycle, because the parse all is supposed to go through your responses, right? No, I agree completely. Everything that's, since parse all is affecting the windows below and not the cycles, it should be with the windows below. 

What are these two percentages? Ah, yes. 

No, it's saying compared to response one. 

Yes, so the percentages, now they're, no, no, no, they're telling you compared to the original file now, because now you have those files in your repo. And so you can see at a glance that the new incoming number three there, the scaffolding plan is 70 % different. Yep. So this is, and now you can see the original over on the right was 800 tokens. And this new one is 692. 

So this is smaller. 

Yeah. It's been changed probably because it's not making a whole code project anymore. Um, yeah. So now see, now it's planning out your modules. See, see that plan? This one's 70%. 

Is this the original then? No, no, no. The originals are, you would just need to open them. And so you could right click on this. The originals are just open the spiral and then the source folder. Oh, gotcha. 

Okay. And you can see the lessons are all markdown files. You're going to get your lesson one. You're going to get your lesson two. It's good that it's putting them in this creation phase. Your key concepts in its own markdown. 

It's putting your overview in its own markdown. That'll allow the editing over time. Let's say one part is wrong. You just say, hey, this marked out the overview needs correction. It won't go and rewrite the whole lesson just to just to update the overview. 

And then once you've got all your thing, all your ducks in a row, then you say, OK, now make the final. 

version of lesson one. Now you've got one big -ass markdown file you copy and paste into Confluence. Bada bing, bada boom. Now it just tweaks it. Can you edit these files right in your... No, no. 

You can after you accept it. So the process would be, say you like this but you want to tweak it. This is the one you want to go with. 

Because again, you're the human in the loop. 

It's not doing all the work for you. 

It's generating the file, and then you're doing exactly what you want to do, which is tweak it. 

So in order to do that, all you've got to do is click select this response, and then baseline at the top right. And actually, the baseline should be moved down as well, almost. that. Things should be co -located. Now you can click select all, see how it's lit up correctly. Not yet, it's not there yet. 

So the baseline is just as a commit. Oh, gotcha. Yep, so now select all. Now accept. Yep, see now it's cycle context would be the next thing you do, but not yet because you want to make changes. So now you can go now your files are in there. 

So now you can go to the originals. I could technically do it. Yeah, actually, actually, this is you've just revealed something that I've always hated. But the way you've done it doesn't do it the way I've always hated. I hate the one the little bitty inline like it shows just one little diff. 

I always want to see the exact file line by line. 

So this is magnificent. I would love this is what I want mine to look like. I want this to have I want my I'll do that. That'll be my next version. That's why I was going to ask because this is good because you can see it's hard to know what was different. Look, you've shown me the solution. 

I love it. Thank you so much. I've been trying to do this the hard way. I believe since it exists in VS Code, I can leverage it. I just didn't know. 

Do it this way. This is it. You're just seeing exactly what's changed. But I could technically make, should be able to make, Yeah, see, I can make changes in here. So if I didn't like some wording in here, instead of trying to get wasting cycles to try to change certain wordings, I can just go in here and do it myself. Right, right. 

Yeah, minor tweaks? Yeah, but for the large scale... Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like minor things, like it keeps referencing, you know, maybe it has names wrong. keeps calling something Yeah, and when you correct it, yep, and when you correct it in these source documents, it's good moving forward. That's right Yep, it'll be just like that's how it was when you you know, exactly. 

Yeah, so wait and then you just commit these Yep, so actually no it will do that on the next baseline now cancel. So now actually click on the spiral. So Click on the sort folder. Yep. So close. Yeah, so you see how they say M That means that they've been modified since the last time you clicked baseline. 

Okay, where's the baseline? 

Over on the right, the button. 

Oh, here again. 

So actually, yeah, you could, I would close the, because I know how VS Code is with modified files. You cut, you've got two modified files that you need to get off of your open active tabs. One of them is that one, Prompt MD. What you did in the PromptMD was you cut. You can just, yeah, don't save. 

It's fine. 

It's always generated. It doesn't matter. Yep. 

And then the second one is that, that one. Yeah. It's just the left one. You can close that as well. Yep. But it's the, cause it's got the dot. 

It's got, yeah. 

Go ahead and don't save. Yeah. Don't save. 

Now click baseline. If you don't, it'll. Yeah. Cause it says you have it open. 

That's right. 

And then we, we hate now. Now you've basically done that. You've committed them all at once. That's what baseline is doing for you. Because you're happy with that now. Yeah, now you can make your small changes if you want in here, but your way is great 

too I will try to integrate your way now that I've seen it I just like that one because one if it the old stuff had some stuff that was taking out, but that was good Yeah, I want to put that back in there. Yeah, absolutely. It's important to see it. I want to surface that kind of stuff I think this is a great. I think you know you've done some crazy shit. You haven't seen what I made We should yeah I'll have to show you what I mean there. 

Concentrate on doing like an individual module. And honestly, we can just do like that's exactly module five. Lesson five is a very simple static content for after actions. We can experiment building. What I worry about now is because I've just been using chat GPT and you know, when I have a file structure and I've been just using that and it gives me consistent formatting and flow, which is good. But I want to experiment and use this for like lesson five. 

And what I can do is just get open source resources ready for lesson five, figure out what I need for that. That's the problem too, is usually, so just for like, you know, so you can get your wheels spinning, like what I'll usually do is like I say, hey, these are the ELOs I am trying to build training on. Find me open source trainings and documentations and list them. that might help in a system. Then I kind of go through these and say, yeah, this is, you know, and I give it specific ones. I'm like, use like MITRE framework as an example, use NIST, use DoD documentations, use stuff from . 

orgs, . 

edu. 

I try to like keep it away from . com stuff, grab those resources that it finds, and then I ask it to build some training based on those resources. 

So it's a two -step process because I don't want it to 

building a lesson yet until I have some good resources to look at. Yeah, and AI studio does have the ability to do Google searches and reference and retrieve. Right. Yeah. So keep that. Yeah. 

But that's very good. 

No, that's a good idea. I didn't think about that, about using it to find some OSINT training sources. That's a good idea. Yeah, I've been using it. We've been using it to pull actual cyber reports from like MITRE. Oh, and it's so fresh too, isn't it? 

It's always like so recent. Yeah. So, which is good because I'll say, hey, try to find out some sort of Intel intelligence report, open source report that was based on a Navy ship. You know go through or a PT activity that has targeted maybe in general and then I'll pull those reports Of course, I look at them. Sometimes they're accurate. Sometimes it's not there's a thing I've also been having issues as it gives references and it says in accordance with whatever whatever But then when I go to the reference and try to do like a control F and find where it's referencing It's not actually in there. 

So that's like kind of an error issue and The documentation might be right, but then when it's trying to pull from, it's like, I don't know, you know, I don't know exactly where it was referencing or where it was saying it, you know, it within this documentation. So I'll have to go ahead and remove that. Yep. That's another issue too. So now I've been having better prompts where I say. what I've been doing and I take them out I say go ahead and anytime you reference or using some sort of because before it wouldn't give the training it would just pull it would just take that the material and just build training I'd say reference put a reference at the end of every um the material that you know if you're referencing any of these documentations but then I go in there and I double check it I don't keep the references in there a lot because then it just clogs up and it's like every other sentence it's just 

reference, but it allows me to go in and double check to make sure those references are accurate. And this is with chat GPT mostly. 

Yeah. 

Have you tried deep research? No. So the it's it, the, the problem with it is it's wordy. 

It would make you like a large report. 

However, it's citation and sourcing and references is pretty good. Um, only, uh, more it's less often. then more often is when I, you know, have that situation where you just explain where you open it up and there's no reference to it. So, give that a shot. One time, if you just open up Gemini . Google, click Deep Research and run it in parallel with whatever you're doing in the same, when you're doing like, when you want open source citations and stuff, Deep Research I think is pretty good at that. 

Yeah, okay. I think what, let's shoot for like sometime next week or maybe even, I'm getting kind of bombarded with assessment stuff right now, but let's look at doing an actual module. I think this is like a key thing. The only thing I kind of just would suggest is the GUI itself is kind of, You know, just joint it. You're right. It's like, okay, you got to click here and then up here. 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, the buttons very close together. You're right. And then in a particular order, maybe that you'll usually, because I did like how you showed the highlight and that was fucking pretty cool. 

Like, okay, cool. 

But it was just like here, here, here, here, you know, so. No, you're right. That's absolutely true. 

And there's another issue I noticed as you were doing it. When you tab away and tab back, the highlight goes away. 

So I'm gonna have to make sure that that doesn't... It probably loses track of where you were in the... It's a persistence thing. 

It's a typical, yeah. 

Yeah. I need to make sure it's saved somewhere. Yeah, I do. I like the concept. Everything you've done is pretty cool. I think it'd be a lot cooler once... 

Yeah, click on that spiral. You know what you should do? You should just have like an auto... So, you know... 

We were, I guess that would be from the other response too, like an auto copy button. 

I don't know, like instead of, I did have like issues, you know, going in control A, control C, you could just have, you know, copy a clipboard button. So over on the right I do, but it's only for the individual file. You see right below sort, there's that tiny little clipboard button. But what you're looking for, that would just be for the file. What you want is for the whole prompt file. I could totally do that. 

Next to generate prompt, there could also just be a little copy prompt button. Easy peasy. But also click the spiral. 

I think that would help eliminate copy -paste issues or I don't know. 

No, you're right. 

I'm all about reducing number of keystrokes. 

And yeah, going from three to one is exactly that. Open the spiral. I want to show you the settings because that is what's coming next. So up at the top right. Yep. So I've got a little changelog there, but you see that local API URL, the free mode and the local LLM mode at the top? 

Yeah. 

That's coming next. So basically, I've got a coding model on my local, so I can just build out all the functionality so that when we, as a company, have an official API key, we've got to do is scroll up and drop it in in that little URL and Bob's your uncle Bob's your uncle you just because you change the radio button from the free mode for the AI studio mode to the LLM mode and then it you don't you don't paste in responses anymore they just stream in yep exactly So that's on UKI proper. How much are these API keys going to cost? So it's actually per token. So every single token you send and every single token it sends you back is priced. 

And actually my little system has a little pricing, a total estimation cost right there. Sometimes it's zero. I think you've got to get it ready to write. So I think just write ASDF in the cycle context. You minimized it, which is, yeah, you can minimize the cycle. Yeah. 

Over on the left. Uh, I I've tricked myself. Yep. I'm like, wait, where did it go? Yeah. Click that. 

There it goes. Uh, enter something in cycle context. I think it's just because there's a, there's a zero it's dividing by zero. And now that I'm thinking about it, maybe, maybe not. Um, okay. It's not definitely not doing well. 

And then now right in the new cycle, uh, just put something in new cycle. Oh, and the cycle title because it's, it's, it's trick. It's yes. Yeah, I think, yeah. The only thing I think I see is Asda go in there and do it. sure what you're doing and you're just running cycles repeatedly. 

Yeah, that's why I'll have the cost up there. 

And also, that's why local models are so valuable, is the cost is zero. 

Right. Okay, so it's important that we mature our AI solution here. I think a great solution, too, with just kind of thinking out loud, As we're moving forward, like once we get it to help reduce costs, right, if we build a baseline for static content and lab, one of the questions, you know, when you go in there, it's like, okay, what are you building this for? And then it's like a checkmark, okay, static content, and it automatically just loads up all the appropriate templates, stuff like you need, you know, that master file for. static content, and then you could do labs, because labs are going to have not only the content, but then you're going to have instructor guides, et cetera, et cetera, for at least the content side. I'm thinking, so as you do this, I really need to fix this pricing. 

It's actually not important because your records, what you create, you're going to create something that we can then reverse count the cost, what it would have cost to create this with APIs. So we're going to get that metric, actually, by you doing this. When you're done, you're going to say, well, it would have cost X to make module 5. We can do an AAR with your JSON file, and I can do that. I can make that data. Yeah, at least within the context. 

Yeah, but on the first round, everything is refined, and then that gives us a number, a price point. You know, hey, $500 per lesson, right? So that's the price, and then that's what the user, the content user, a developer gets assigned in his API allocation. is the $500 to generate the course and you manage it yourself. You see your cause. You see, Oh, I'll just use one cycle for this one. 

No big deal. And this one, I need more cycles. I'll up the responses and I'll get four responses. Yeah. Yeah, totally. We just got to make sure at that point, if it's upon that, that the people that are using it get really good proper training. 

That's right. I agree. Cause you, you know what I mean? You start screwing up and you're like, Oh, I wasted 20 cycles. Cause of experience. That's right. 

Yeah. And experience. Yeah. You see it, man. That's right. 

That's the future is this, these skills, knowing how to work with AI because the power gain is immense. 

So it's the difference. 

It's almost like an Intel intelligence. It's like an IQ test for people. Roundabout roundabout because you genuinely you can you can be looking for the same product project you you and one other person But you just have the better words because you've learned the right words to use the egg with the AI that that's it That's IQ. That's you. You know, I think we need to make like, you know focus on you have a lot of the technical stuff, but how to make it a Simplify it, you know, and obviously every rendition every time you go through it, you know, you discover some stuff today It'll make it that a little bit more efficient. 

Yeah, so literally like the intro thing is like you can say, you know I guess what my mind is like I go in there and I have everything set up and I know how to use it and But it's like, okay, I want a new project. 

So it automatically copies over the appropriate, you know, what kind of project is this for, you know, total, you know, you can have it basically three ways. 

You could have, hey, I, I don't have anything right now. 

I am trying to create an overall course for static content and labs, like an outline, like kind of what we did today. 

Start with that. And then that then feeds into, okay, well, I have everything set up. 

I have all the ELOs lined up. 

I have kind of like what I know, what I want my lessons like. Let's start building the content. Click this box. create. This is a static content. These are the ELOs based off, we're giving some of the information and it automatically takes in all those templates and starts building out the thing. 

So maybe the first one is, hey, based off of this, it goes and searches open source and it gives you a wide variety of open source stuff and you can kind of go through and spend a day You know what I mean? And then from there, it's like, oh, these are accurate. Go ahead and create a training using the template of, you know, we use for confluence, you know, based off of this. And then, you know, obviously there's more that goes into this because I like to have real world or hypothetical scenarios related to the customer. Training may be different, but, you know, as far as the outline, I think that like, I think this is heading in the right direction. Yeah, you know compared to like well, it's been almost a month last time we kind of chatted so You know kudos on you man, like that's on some good shit. 

I think you don't even know man. Just gotta make it You don't even know I've made my own PCT. Yeah. Yeah that was so what I the way so what I did was once I had the version of my Extension I needed to test it. I needed to beta test it. So I started a project to beta test it So it's the first project I've made with my own extension And I call it a virtual cyber proving ground. 

And it's actually a PCT environment, you log in, it's got a range, spins up in Docker, it's multiplayer, there's a chat lobby. So you create a team, and then you can spin up a scenario of multiple scenarios. The first scenario I've made, it's a 10 minute or so long scenario where you've got to sort of play like cognitive defense, cyber defense for your UAV fleet, the engineers hacking into your UAVs. You've got to remote in and change their encryption, their certificate, or you've got to change the frequency that they're connected to. And you can also brute force and attack, hack into, it's a team mission. 

You're actually writing SL commands in a terminal. 

You connect to the drones and you fix them, or you brute force the enemy drones And it's AI integrated So you can highlight the word SSH and you get a little tooltip pop -up says, you know, you can ask Jane I've modeled it like ender's game from battle at battle school So you can it'll tell you contextual what SSH is so like you just highlight SSH and ask It'll tell you in this mission. You'll use as SSH is this and you'll use it for this Yeah Yeah, everything every single text you can highlight and ask the AI on you can create Intel chips that get shared with your team. In other words, like it's like a little sticky note that you can create you highlight anything you can create an Intel chip, it'll go to Jane Jane will process it and she'll turn it into something contextual for the lesson. So like when you find the drone manifest that has all the drone IP addresses, with the drone names. You can highlight that whole thing and then turn it into an Intel chip and now your other teammates don't have to go find the drone manifest. They can just click on the Intel chip on the right table. 

Yeah, dude. Yeah, dude. 

Yeah, dude. So yeah, no shit, no shit. And then at the end, after action report, we'll be able to discern like the skill bases of the users because it's multiplayer. 

You get points for doing who hacked what, whatever. 

But also you get two terminals and we can determine who used two terminals. Who did multitasking? Who did the same task on two terminals? 

Who did different tasks on two different terminals? 

Versus who just used one terminal? How fast did you type? Because I have this system now, I can just talk to the AI with my extension. and say, hey, now we want to be able to measure their typing speed. Hey, now we want to be able to measure their multitasking abilities. Here's the system, how can we measure it? 

Oh, the AI's got a PhD in psychology, so it can help me come up with some very good metrics, and we've already got the whole system in front of it. So yeah, dude, that'll be my next demo day. 

Yeah, so that's what I did the past week, and then I got to a stopping point there, and then I turned around over the weekend to make all the changes to the extension that I found and discovered during that beta test cycle. Yeah. Yep. Sweet, man. Yeah. After an evening, 30 minutes, I'd love to show. 

No one's seen it yet. No one's seen my virtual cyber proving ground yet. 

So I'm anxious to show it to someone. 

So I don't know who. Yeah. I'll take a look at it. If you want to. Yeah. I mean, it's on my other computer. 

I'd have to switch. Yeah, let's plan out, because I've got to get rolling on a couple of other things here. 

Yeah, anytime on Discord, because Discord's on my personal. 

Just message me, and then I can share screen. Yeah, I think, again, make sure you're showing how to make it relatable within our stuff. So I think if we can get at least, you know, we can spend an hour or so whenever we meet next, and then work on Lesson 5, and I'll have to do some prep work to start. What I'll do is I'll gather the open source resources. 

We can skip that step right now that I would want from it and then just create a file structure. Basically, I don't know if we'd have to create a whole new database based on each module, how that would work, or you just create a folder and say, hey, we're working strictly on this. Maybe that's something you got to think of, but I'll gather resources and then what we'll do is we'll kind of work together on just showing proof of concept right yeah hey but yeah I'm gonna tell you a Brian's not gonna like it because we're basically showing a way to create a lot of training just from AI but you know dr. Scott Wells is basically on board so going back to yeah there's a lot of human interaction that needs to be involved in this process so I just keep that in mind Otherwise, you might get a lukewarm response to it. 

But I think if we can show, hey, I provided the resources and then have it reference what you've got to do as an instructor going in, as a content creator. 

The fear with all this, my extension solves, which is the ad hoc interaction with AI. Company, I know I I understand I'm just saying some people are still rebellious against it. That's you know, just keep that in mind I know I know so I wouldn't get a get offended. 

No, I definitely working smarter not harder Yeah a hundred percent a I can pop is a million times smarter than I am as far as like there's no way I could produce the content I produced without AI. Yeah, you know to me I So but using it smartly, right? So yeah, a power token can drill your leg if you're not. Yeah, yeah, so that's all you know. I totally understand and I'm on board with what you what you're doing and you know. Yeah, just keep pushing I guess and then let's do let's focus next one will focus on. 

So what as you're kind of going through like before next one, just let me to tell me what you need for me as far as like I said, I'm going to get all the open source references. I'll have the yellows I'll have. Anything else? I guess, I don't know, kind of like what I do when I go through the writing style content updates. And then we can just go from scratch. I'm not going to use the existing. 

Yeah, I was good. I was thinking that. I want to use my existing chat GPT input. I want to test Gemini and start from scratch saying, hey, I want to build a lesson on module, you know, a lesson. whatever this lesson that's based on these LOs and open source resources, this is the template I want to use, and let it figure that out. And what I like also, if possible, I don't want to give you more work, but if you think of it this way, if we had like two examples of the NC DOC content, one is your original approach that you were going to do anyway, as if I didn't exist, And then another one that, you know, the same modules through this process. 

So where the two, they didn't touch each other. The only thing that touches each other is this initial reference documentation that you may have used in the both. Yeah. References and ELS. Yeah, no, we can do that. I'll mess around with chat GPT. 

That might help alleviate some concerns. What I'll do is I was going to work on lesson four, but I'll move over to lesson five. Uh, Intel Threat, let me see. I'm just looking to see what has a lower amount of ELOs right now. It might not be necessary, I mean... No, it's just work content for me. I can knock out less than 5 a lot quicker. 

Yeah, there's only like 10.. . 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.. . 

8. Again, I'm trying to do small scale. I don't want to do a lesson that's 20 ELOs because it's going to be long as hell. I'm just, you know, especially for demo purposes. And not only that, the moment you have one done, it becomes an example for the rest. Yeah, I'm just going to use... uh yeah because but here's the thing this one has a lot of like here's the elos to me 

regular expressions for Splunk, develop regular expressions for Splunk automated tasks, identify how regular, this is based off of introduction of threat hunting and advanced analytics, create basic Sigma rules, identify, so basically after you have developed, you found a threat, it's how do you, Update your signatures and your automations within second onion elastic and stuff to stay on top of those guys You know me. Yeah, so yeah, it shouldn't be too hard. It's gonna be more technical than it is Yeah. Oh, yeah, man. So like oh so for example as you're going through you're gonna come up with a template like each Section is gonna need its image. So you're gonna have it make an image prompts for each section, right? 

Yeah. Yeah, these are the yellows for section 5 So it's not a whole lot, but just so you can get your brain thinking, because these, here's the thing. These are a lot easier to teach because it's just, that's it, right? 

As opposed to like introduction to CTI, where you got to kind of more tell a story. So let's give it this one because this might be difficult because I'm expecting it to give me examples on how to's. 

And I write that in my direction. 

Like if it's an ELO that requires you to create something, make sure to, Process that out and it easy to flow how to And then also give a conceptual idea of it and then also put it in an example of why this is important for them as a going to a Navy ship So the thing is to keep in mind, but those are different, you know, I go to the next training those requirements are going to change and 

right? 

Like a different whatever, so. Yeah. 

Yeah. 

Well, and also we can do it on the existing one too, actually. I don't know if you would rather do that, but here's the thing. Actually, this might be easier. 

Trib already did. This one's here, the yellows for, those are going to probably be clickable links to a Confluence page, but this one is more less, Technical and more let's just like the concept of ideas. Yeah. Yeah All that is basically gonna be almost even like in the pre -training You see how those two lessons are different like that first one's gonna be just really strict technical stuff Yep, where the other one is it's really like okay explain cyber threat intelligence. 

Well, there's probably a million different ways You could explain it. 

You know what I mean? 

Yeah, so that's really putting the AI to work like and then the consistency is what I can you know how it explains it in 6 .1 .1 I want to make sure it stays along that line with 6 .1 .2 and 6 .2 .1 you know and then so it looks like it's not one smooth training almost definitely yeah the way you'll get that is this holistic approach that's where people lack that as they do piecemeal and then the AI doesn't know what was in step you know module one versus module two And then you just get repetition. 

But this approach, even when you're working on module one, because module two is in context, it won't be repeating it. It'll know. Yeah. 

And most of these will be combined. Like this one, we combined it, like the first three, it's like one. And just because it's one paragraph can cover multiple ELOs, depending on what it is. All right. So also it's figuring out how to combine 

not each one needs its own individual training, they can be put in together, right? 

So... to automate Splunk tasks, but also what will be the Regex Splunk tasks on the ship. 

That, it won't know. Maybe you'll make a lit, maybe you'll make some artifacts that just outline some of those tasks that, yeah. And that can't come from anywhere else. And then once you've got it outlined as an artifact, then every reference will be in that line. You'll get that sort of, yeah. Something to keep in mind if you want to bring up Splunk and like Plastic, they're really good. 

They have like their online libraries and their official documentations. I mean, they have a lot of it, but I've been downloading a lot of it just to have and it's a great way like instead of always having to try like, hey, I basically have the whole Splunk how -to from Splunk. Granted, it's probably fucking large as hell, but... 

It's a great resource so you don't have to continuously go in and try to find other resources or anything elastic. Elastic is really nice because it's either Splunk or Elastic. Actually, if I find documentations, I just have a quick download button right there. I can download it and put it as a reference. Some Splunk stuff didn't have that and it wouldn't go over copy well in PDF. So I had to either do screenshots or 

actually downloaded a plugin that automatically screenshots the whole webpage and pieces it together, which is nice. 

Those are like limited cases. So when I was at the training over the week, one of the students, he was really interested in some of the AI stuff. And over the past week, he took my extension and he made a Slack bot that he trained it on some JQR stuff. so it can help his team, they can ask it questions on JQRs. But what he did was, what I was talking about before, which was like that big file that you had, if we had an embedding, a RAG, that on -the -fly tooling, that's what he made. He has a local LLM, it's an embedding model, and then he has just a local Google model, and those are the two models that he needed, and so he's got his own little Slack bot, now his team can ask questions to it, And he's taught it with all the, you know, rag or whatever with the PDF. 

And so that's, so that's what I did at Palo is I downloaded all the publicly facing Palo Alto PDFs on their website. It was like 52 different product PDF documents. And I just appended them one after another after another. And then I just embedded them all. And then out came an AI that just knew all the Palo Alto products and where to click and what to do and the difference between XDR Android and XDR official. I'm saying like these spunk ones. 

I would go through I could just get the master thing and say hey use this as a reference and use this Examples that has a lot of good shit in there. 

But yeah, um, hey, this was a good I know it's been about a month. There's a great update There's devil and then you've been definitely killing it as far as you know since last time we used it But yeah, let's get something that 

week and then we'll work on, we'll do, how about this? 

We'll kind of work on one that's already existing. 

We'll just do less than one with the CTI stuff and see how well it comes out compared to what we have. 

And maybe it might surprise us and change up some content. So, yeah man. Let me know, just keep hitting me up, anything you need from me. I just posted a picture. I don't know why. It re -imaged it. 

Yeah, that picture there is like this plugin you can put in. 

It will automatically just screenshot a whole page and stitch it together, which is pretty cool. So if you're having a hard time getting all the information from the reference, you could just use that plugin. 

And then, like I said, it'll copy the whole webpage, which is pretty cool. I'm sending a couple of screenshots I got already that I had lying around. Oh, shit. Right? That's pretty cool. And then there's a login page somewhere. 

I got saved. There it is. That's pretty neat. That's pretty cool, man. I could imagine us making those scenarios. Are you just hosting that locally? Yeah. 

And it's using, so Docker, and actually we did the maths. I could host of 10, 50 people concurrent on just one laptop. Then I could just use the second laptop and double that. So I could do 10 different scenarios. Huh. Full. 

Yeah. That's pretty cool. That's right. That's right. Because that was one way. Oh yeah, well the problem is it's not hundreds, eventually it'll be thousands and tens of thousands. 

Well, the problem is we're supposed to be using PCTE because that's what the government invested a billion dollars into maintaining. And the problem is, I don't know when you came on board, but we did use actively use PCTE before where you just focused on Bravo. But the problem is we could only get an update like once a month and it was broken half the time. So the government does come out, you know, we're using Bravo, but they say, hey, we have to use PCTE and we got to use PCTE. You know what I mean? Yeah. 

Yeah, but yeah, no that was again that I that was just I chose that it was more about testing the extension and we can cut it here. I Made that because that's what Eric was trying to make. He showed me his project He was actually using an agentic coding tool and he was trying to make like a training platform Similar to similar to this so to show him I made this and I will show it to him and I can even I can just hand it over to him and Because all my cycles and all my code, I just hand it over to him, and now he's just running with it, and he's developing for free. Now he just follows my process. That's exactly what you wanted, Eric, right there. There you go. 

And the transfer is what's key. It's just instant transfer. We could talk all day on it, I swear to God. I hear you, man. I've been trying to do better at clocking in on my time because I get stuck on things and then I'm like, shit, I start falling behind on certain things. So I'm trying to use the block scheduling as much as possible to get my life somewhat organized because things are starting to compound with NCDoc stuff. 

Yeah, man. Yeah, let's get back to get we'll schedule something for next week. I do have a couple of appointments next week, so I'll just touch base with you. We'll try to shoot for like another Monday and we'll go from there. Yeah. And if we if we push it, we just push it to the next week. 

It's no big deal. Yeah, sounds good. Just as you're coming up with stuff and knowing that we're kind of moving actually into the static content now with let me like if something comes up like, hey, just keep in mind X, Y, Z, you should, you know, have this ready, you know, so I can kind of get all those things together. So I just put, I'm going to be pulling open source projects, resources, ELOs, and we already have all that stuff for that project, which will make it kind of, will make it easy. So, and then we'll go into, I'll start kind of thinking to what I would be asking for cycles, right? And I'll just kind of reference what I'm kind of doing with chat GPT So that should make it kind of easier as far as like I'm gonna be asking. 

Okay. Yeah, here's a good idea. Here's a good idea The guy I was telling you about he's like, you know One of the one of the students he was doing something similar using chat GPT and using this and he got into a point where he came up with the solution in his chat GPT, but then he was struggling to bring that solution, the context of that solution back into AI studio. And I suggested to him, which is probably going to be very useful for you, is whenever you're trying to move back and forth, in my extension, there's the ephemeral context section. Yeah. So you could literally take the chat GPT response, like whatever has the whole response and drop it in that ephemeral context section, and then refer to that in your cycle context, say in the ephemeral, I put that chat GPT that solved the problem, and then blah, blah, blah, it'll only be there in that cycle. 

And then moving forward, it won't be cluttering your context. Right? Yeah. Just a way to use that because he didn't think about it until and I didn't, you know, Well, I suggested that to him, and he's like, that's perfect. That's exactly how he could get the context back in. Yeah. 

All right, man. Love it. Sounds good. I'll let you go, my friend. Thanks again. I enjoy sharing. 

And yeah, in the evening at any time, hit me up. And then when you're not busy, and I'll just click through this VCPG thing that I'm messing around with. Sounds good. Cool. See you, bud. See you.
