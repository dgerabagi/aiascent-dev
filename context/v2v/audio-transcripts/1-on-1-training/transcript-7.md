Good. 

How are y 'all? Heck yeah. Now's the time, man. I think, yeah, that's really cool. You remind me of myself and my roommate. His name is Matt. He now works, you know, cybersecurity. 

He's actually deployed some AI solutions. So like getting an enterprise, an actual API that it can actually use so its employees can actually start making LLM calls that are like actually paid for by the company and not just like oh, I'm just helping do my work in a chat GPT window So API API, are you familiar with that that term? 

Cool? 

No problem. Good good No, it's it's important that we are clear and you ask quite don't feel like you think it's a stupid question I just need I just need to know where you're at to get you up. You know what I mean? If I talk over you it's not very helpful. 

That's fine. 

That's good. 

Okay, you won't need it Yeah, you won't need it. The beauty of this process is you get to, I envy you, you get to learn everything with AI. I had to, when I was 18, 18, 19, 20, I wanted to make my own Lineage 2 game server, it was my favorite game. And I had to learn literally everything, how to set up a server, everything from scratch by just reading documentation, reading forms of other people trying to set it up. And believe me, setting up things back then, 12 years ago was not, anything like it is now. 

And so you with AI, you're going to get not only like in every having a professor in your pocket, every answer you want, but also on demand the best answer possible. That's what's the best answer possible. And if it's ever wrong, so is a professor sometimes. What's your point? But then also it's literally the only time you're asking a question is It's when you're actually learning, you need to learn something. And so when it gives you something, it's not working, you're still learning. 

That's what the problem, most people will stop at that point. They'll feel like they've failed or something when the actual learning is in the continuation of the process, right? So just sort of setting a baseline. Okay, so y 'all can see my screen. So kind of the, this is a proof of the product. So from just prompting, let me just reopen this. 

What is A . I . Synth? A . I . Synth is a business simulation game where you take on the role of a founder in a fast -paced, high -stakes world of artificial intelligence. 

You manage every aspect of your startup from groundbreaking research, account acquisition, building out massive compute infrastructure, launching world -changing AI projects. Some of the cycles, what I've done, older cycles, just like a changelog, right? But cycles are the key to how I am able to build such a thing and not just get limited by say like, oh, my fuck, okay. The first project I made was a Slack bot. That's what I believe y 'all are gonna wanna make. 

It was only about a thousand lines of code. I could even open the file. It's a Python file and I can share it with you. You can literally take it and then run with it and even go further with it because back then we didn't have local models. We didn't have local thinking models like we have now. You can get, on your GPU, you can install the OpenAI open source model. 

Finally, they're truly open. They've been closed AI until they finally open opened release the open source model But I believe you're it'll fit on yours and that can be your AI answering questions for you So it's all you so that solves like sort of a Cooee problem. You see what I'm saying? You're not sending API calls to External it's all on your it's the Cooee is on the same device that that that your PDF is on you see I'm saying so So you're installing your own weight, your own actual AI model. So I have actually that software up over on my server that's running the game you're looking at. I'm remoted in and I have, this is a tool called LM Studio, which is just a fantastic tool. 

I recommend you download it if you want to install your own AI. There's obviously your own AI won't be as good as what Google can produce, right? 

I just thought of something. 

Hold on. Where's my desk? 

Oh, there it is. I think I can also turn on the thing. 

That one? 

Say hi to you. 

Hi. 

Okay. All right. So this one is the, OSS is the open AI one. It would fit on your 16 gigabyte. Then they made it that way. I believe they made it to fit on 16 gigabytes. 

So you're good to go there. I've been trying to get it running. I haven't been able to get it running. I haven't tried too hard because I've just been using Quinn, which is a Chinese model. I do not recommend you using a Chinese model, but the Chinese models are better. So for me, for my game, I'm making a game. 

I'm learning. I could care less about it. I'm not under threat by the Chinese model because it's a big race. It's a big race. China's not gonna the the dangers in 30 years when everyone's been Using the Chinese model and it's so integrated and it's so much better now that the moment They don't want us to use it. We won't use it in some you see what I'm saying? 

Because it's their model they have that they have the they have whatever backdoor they have in there to make it not so then they just were crippled instantly because we were absolutely using all business as usual, which is using the cheapest, most efficient thing. So that's the long term. So I don't care for myself. I'm going to try to make, you know, use it for non work related things. So, but for you, for your project, I would definitely go with either Gemma three, 12 billion, which is the Google model. 

It's not bad. It's just not a thinking model. And this one is yeah. Gemma three, Gemma three, the 12 billion. That would fit on 16 gigabytes. So you can just download those two models and fiddle with them This one will be much easier for you. 

It's it's uh to just use um, but this one might be I don't know I don't know i'm hearing I haven't used it. It's it's uh, What makes it special over this one is it's got more features. It's got two specific things Really the two things that truly matter whether or not it's a good model or not. Uh still it matters as well If it's a bad model, it's got the features who cares If the other model without the features are still better But the features are thinking it can it which is another in other words the chain of thought it prompts itself before it answers you so like it thinks on your question first just all it's doing is just Given a little thought block and it writes in there first so it can plan accordingly and then it you know And then it'll respond to you. So just like a human if you think before you speak the answer usually comes out better So that's the one feature And then the other feature is mixture of experts. And what that is, is that allows you to have a much bigger model, but you only activate certain experts. 

They call them experts. There are expert data sets. So for example, this one right here, coin three, 30 billion. A3B. That 30B is the 30 billion parameter. So it's 30 billion parameters, which is a lot of parameters. 

But only 3 billion are active at any given time. And so what's going on behind the scenes there is it's got a bunch of expert data sets, but only a certain some of them are active at any given time based off the question, which makes sense, right? You don't always need The rocket scientist to chime in, right? Maybe. So it's a good solution. It's a great solution. 

It's fantastic. And so this is a fantastic model. 

Quint 30 billion, but it's a Chinese model. 

This would be, in my opinion, second best given your hardware. And then this is probably maybe a bit more spicy, maybe a bit harder to set up, but maybe, maybe, maybe better because it's got those features that Google does not offer. So, okay. Just that's, now that's just all there is to the LLM. Just use LLM Studio and get those couple, get this one and that one. And this is a small one actually. 

So this one is, this one is, what is special about this one? It's smaller. It's really small. It's basically, it's pretty smart and it's pretty small. It's smart for its size. 

So there are, so that would be a third good one to get. 

There are, over time, and you can literally just not worry about it, because over time, you'll discover there may be sub -workloads, maybe a smaller local, maybe. 

just discover these over time But yeah, just knowing it's a good smaller model is enough just knowing it exists So if you ever think you need one, yeah, you know, which one to go to is all but it's not important for yeah hard to say Definitely just okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm trying to give you what you would care about but generally it would be like cost so like The smaller models can run on smaller machines. They can be cheaper. 

They're more efficient. But also, then the tradeoff is they're not, you might be asking a question that the smaller model cannot handle. So then in that case, you need to upgrade to the larger one. But with cost being a driving factor, which isn't, see, that's not our case. That's why I'm not really saying it's not too important to you guys, because cost isn't too important to you guys, but the answer to your question is cost. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

And then there's also, I've got this other one. This is the audio. It's called Kokoro TTS server. It's actually just Kokoro FastAPI. It's a Docker container. So you can just search this one down. 

This is to give your AI a voice. Yeah, exactly. And it's actually ridiculously low overhead. It's so ridiculously low overhead, the moment you do it, you'll be shitting yourself, why didn't I do this sooner? It's so easy to do because you because everything is just text already and then all you do is say read that because it's already it's already generated You just read that and it's it's actually really good at reading. You don't like it just goes part III right here It says III which I could just change the III to three if I wanted to You know, no big deal. 

I don't have to have Roman numerals, right? So yeah, so That's that that's that that's the virtue. That's that. Okay. So how is this built? So now here's the foot. 

That's the flip side That's that's the local and it's nice to have your own local because it's fancy and local. However, this is the thing local is not as good as foundational and the foundation was like the chat GPT -7 and whatever is the latest and then so those are going to be the smartest things available and those are going to be the ones that you want to use when you're working and When you do, you want the smartest AI you can possibly get your hands on at working on your problems. And so how is this game built? This game is more than just a simulation. It's an experiment. AI Ascent was built in approximately 110 days by a human curator working in partnership with Gemini 2 .5 Pro. 

The project contains over 600 ,000 tokens of code and 350 ,000 tokens of documentation and was developed for a total cost of $0, as all work was done in Google's AI Studio. is a living testament to the vibe coding to virtuosity development pathway showcasing what's possible when human vision is amplified by artificial intelligence. And while this says the interactive report viewer is coming soon, it's actually already made. And so is actually, oh, I don't know if spectator mode is made, but remember that PVP battle I showed you, that battle I showed you? Well, actually, I made PVP mode. So once two people, it's multiplayer, once two people have that game AI, you can challenge each other, and then one person is the red, 

And one person is the blue and you both watch the same game in parallel, so I've made that as well. I've actually so Just and then that's kind of when I stopped making the game and started making the report viewer. Which is this one more Which is basically? the printing press 2 .0 So I don't know why it's not working in Chrome, but you know what it doesn't matter if I'm gonna look at that How weird is that? Okay. It's not initializing because I would have to close my browser and ain't nobody got time for that. 

But the React should have loaded actually. 

I don't know why the React also isn't loading. But I think I can close my browser and reopen it. I think I changed the setting. So I'll just do that. Yeah. Life is good. 

Yeah. Okay. But why did I want to go here? Oh yeah. So the AI would actually talk. I don't know why. 

Okay. 

That's the difference. 

Okay. 

Clear that. Yeah. So ask me anything uniquely about American solution. What's unique about the proposed, the solution proposed in this report? Oh, let's see what's wrong. Now it's fixable. 

Okay, so it loaded the embedding model to read the database. Let's just try again. Let's see what's from here. Just a little troubleshooting. That's good to see it as well. That might be it. 

And then let's try this as well. Okay, so also this way. So let's try to fix this with AI. So you'll see a bit of the process. So what I'm going to do first is I have my game project here. Yep, this is the AI Ascent game. 

And so I have my extension, the one that I will be sharing with you guys. And so I haven't used it for my game yet. So fix the, fix the, fix Ascentia. She is not, she is not responding. Let me actually, I can actually do it this way. Yeah, that's fine. 

Generate, oh, first, oh yeah. So, I, I, technically the first step is, this is the second step. The first step is to curate your data. First you have to curate your data, and then you can ask questions about it. So I, I, I, let me do that first. So let me clear this out. 

So the list of sample documents, I was, I was test, I was making it, ingest . pdfs in Excel. So all I'm going to do is select my source directory, because that has all of my code in it. I don't need any of these other files. I will take some of these infrastructure -related files, such as the config files, the webpack files, and the package . json, the README. 

These are all very good files to have in my context. 

But there are some that I do not want and I do not need. 

Now over here you can see that the token size. So this file is only 641 tokens thereabouts and that the token count is important because you can't send more than a million to Gemini. So you see I'm over 2 .56 million but I also have a bunch of files that are just actually not code related. This is just a text file that actually you can see it's actually my prompt from some other project's state. So I actually That's in my repo somewhere, so I don't need that. Same thing here. 

It's another prompt. I don't need that. This is a WAV file. I don't need that in my prompt. Settings JSON file. It's just a bunch of zeros. 

I actually don't even know what this file is for. But it's there and I'm gonna yes and it changes over time and in fact just last night For the first time another model has been released and no one knows who's it is, but it's probably Elon's and it's got 2 million token count It's got secret names. It's on the Arena web arena right now people are speculating. It's Elon's because when they ask it it says it's XAI. So yeah, it is his yeah Yeah, I'm trying to solve the problem, and I'm going to solve that problem. The AI is not responding to us right now. 

And so, yeah, this is my code. This is the code for my game. And the game has a problem, just as if your project would have a problem, right? Your code project. See? It doesn't matter that it's a game that I've created. 

Yes, I've created this extension. Precisely, yes. That is, yeah. And I wasn't clear. It's hard to be clear. Yes, that is my intent. 

Yes, thank you. Yep. Yes, every prompt is training. That's what people don't comprehend. Yes, actually. every prop so and let's look at that and you'll see that soon when we go back when I click here You'll see what happens So we're getting that's step three. 

So that's step three any questions about step zero right now You don't you don't you don't need to man. You don't it's literally like a human Talking to a human that just knows answers don't worry about that that you know, don't there's nothing to know about it anymore That was my first fear That's what I started getting into AI three years ago. So I knew nothing about it up until that point, because goodness gracious, machine learning, talk about like the ultimate, like hardest thing to comprehend. Then generative AI comes along. And then I hear two things. One, people are starting companies with it. 

And two, people are writing code with it. I'm like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That's different. Oh, and so the third one, someone started a crypto with it. So I was like, okay, okay. Okay. 

So something is here. This is different So I asked this one simple question If it can write what's the most valuable thing text that can be written if this thing can write text the answer was code Simply because code kids objective anything else is subjective like an essay a novel. It's all subjective I can find you some one who will critique that whatever that novel but Code, it's functional, it either sets out, it does the thing it's supposed to do or it does not. And so it's like verifiable. And that's the errors that you get back, the console logs. And so there you're going to see me get that console log that I get, put it in, and then the AI is going to churn on that, the content, the context, which is all the code files. 

I don't know, I don't fuck it, I don't read code. I know English. That's the only language I know. I don't even know a pro, I couldn't write an if statement to save my life, right? Okay? The AI will handle that part. 

It's my job to have the taste and the gumption to like push through and see the project to completion. So what all I'm doing now is I'm just using the date. So my extension is two windows. It's this left window. which is an evolution of just the file of the Explorer, right? You see you don't have the token count, so you're blind to the most important metric, okay? 

And then so over here you have it, and then you can also sort by token count so you can see what is the largest file, because there's not only, there's not just input token limit, but there's output token limit as well. The AI can only output so much in a cycle, in a response before it cuts off. And that number for Gemini 2 .5 Pro is 65 ,000. And so simply put, if you try to ask the AI to output a whole file and you don't know that the file is larger than 65 ,000, you'll be just struggling, struggling, struggling trying to get it to output the file when what you should be doing is refactoring that file and splitting it up into multiple separate files so that the AI doesn't have to repeat the whole file every time you just need to make a simple change to some part of it because that part is in that part's file now. It's been organized. You'll see that soon. 

Once I click this button, I have an artifact with the training. You said training. 

I have an artifact that I've already battle -tested in my projects to help refactor it. 

It's a refactoring template. And as a user, the first time I did a refactor, I just knew the file was getting too big. I didn't know all the details I just explained. I just knew the file was getting too big. Maybe that's why it can't output it anymore. And so I refactored it, but I didn't know how I should refactor it. 

Like, what metric, by which metric should I refactor it? I don't even know what the file really does. I just know it was for the products, like in my game. And so but the answer to that question is simply the token count just divided by token count So it's like they're all usable again. It's all just token count. Okay, so it's yeah at that so I Believe I've made my selection. 

I could take this one this one. Yep. My mate. Yeah, that's right And I'm and then it's once and done I don't I won't do this again because uh, it's done and this is just the and it's only because I haven't Like I said, this is the first time I've used my extension in my game. I've stopped developing my game, I've started developing the extension. So now, just to illustrate to you a bit of it, like I'm just going right back, so it's from scratch, literally. 

So I'm just, as if I, as if I just, as if you, anyone in the world, just dropped my extension into their VS Code, this would have been their first step. You guys will be just starting a project from scratch, so you would just be starting right here. You wouldn't even be doing this. That's why I called it step zero. Okay. But that's it. 

We're done. That's it. So you can see now it's 745 ,000 tokens, which is manageable. I can fit, it's under a million. There are a few big ones. 12 ,000 is still doable. 

You just have to make sure you, if it's going to output this file, you just got to make sure you double check it more carefully. it might It might say this portion is omitted It's the same for brevity and then so you got to make sure you put it back in or are you or you can you know? Go with another response that maybe did not do that is up in other words, okay? But you're going to see that soon, so I made that selection. I'm just going to say fix it since she is not responding That's just going to be here. I also want to put the errors that I'm getting So I'll copy this and I will say Here is the error I get when, from the welcome message, welcome message error. 

And I'm tagging right now. This is the key lesson right here, is tagging with this. So like, because like, think of it like as the AI, like I'm writing these words here, and I'm writing these words here, and I'm writing these words here, but how does it actually know, you know, beyond just the colon, actually, how would it know this, it starts here and stops here, you know what I mean? Without some sort of the limp. Yeah, because what and then not only that, you know without me being so specific What you know, it could be just what are these stage notes? Is this a novel? 

Is this someone's someone did someone you know, is this your inner monologue? What are these words and so you can tag things and give them meaning that the AI can then recognize So, okay, so there's just that's the welcome message error. There it ends and I can continue And I want to also give it that f12 error. I get let's see And then let's see here, test is clear. Okay, so I don't get any console logs, but that's a report as well. 

Okay, because then it can make console logs to help in the next cycle, it can produce console logs that'll help narrow it down. And that one's just a nothing. Okay, so this is me describing the current environment, the current state, the current cycle. Because it's one thing code to produce code, But then you have to see what the net result is and analyze that. So I don't critique the, I don't look at the code. I look at the end result and then I speak there, you know? 

And that's a bit of a distinction. Many of the developers will just hyper focus on the code when in actuality you can just describe the behavior of the state and it can look at the code and then generate logs and blah, blah, blah. Okay, so sending a message. Here's the response. when sending a message in the report viewer in the Ask Accenture. And then I'll say the last result, which was, and there's no console. 

And then we'll send it off. That's all there is to it. Sent no one above. I was monitored. 

the browser. 

I'll do it one more time and I'll look at the server as well. Monitoring browser console logs and saw nothing appear. Okay, and then let's look at the server. So let's trash that to see if anything is hit. This will tell me if anything's hitting LM studio, right? And then over here, this will tell me, aha, aha, aha. 

Here's actually maybe the evidence we were looking for. 

No models loaded. 

Please load model. It's supposed to load the model. That's frustrating. It's supposed to just auto load. That's why I thought sending it again would work. So it's just this one. 

Oh no, I deleted it. That's right. Okay. I just need to make a change. I just deleted it. I remember what I did, but now we're using this one. 

I think I'll be able to fix this myself. And I'll still send it off. Huh? Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. 

It should still be able to help. But I mean, the error, but you're right. I would still narrow it down had I not, because I literally just said to you, and then we'll send it off. But then I thought, oh, wait a minute. 

No, let's check the server logs as well. 

So it's just being methodical, right? And then the server logs were clear enough to me that I remembered, I literally, I was trying to clear, I was literally trying to clear off some space on here, literally. And I was like, oh, I now have a, I have a smarter model, a smarter version of it. And I just haven't changed. I literally just remembered I haven't changed. So first of all, it's not loading. 

So let me see if that's because this guy's, I doubt it. Let me first make sure I can get it to load. Let's see the GPU here. Interesting. Normally you see this. Oh, there we go. 

It's going into my memory. So there's a problem. Let's poke around in LM Studio to see what's going on. First, let's go to the hardware. So yes. Hold on. 

No, let's put on the limit, because I've got 24. So let's system limit offload. Now let's try to load it again. Updates. We'll update these things. 

These are just different things they need to run the models. I don't know what they do. 

In the old days, two years ago, you would have to do a lot of this shit. Shit, now it's, LM Studio manages it a lot. So whatever it is, you just, you might keep your stuff updated. 

It's large, like it detects your GPU. 

If my machine had two GPUs in here, it would just detect them and it would just, it's really nice. It's been really streamlined. See, here's all the models available. You could just click one and download it. You know, it was just one of these versions that I deleted, because I had the newer version now. But that should help. 

Let's go check out to see what that did. Let's try to run it again. See, it's supposed to be loading into my GPU. Dedicated GPU memory. So maybe that's setting. But it loaded. 

Wait a minute, wait a minute. But it did load. So let's talk to it. There it is. Clear. Okay, let's see. 

Wait a minute. Dude, that's in memory? That's fast, kind of, for memory. I'm confused. So the model is running. That's my version of Quint3, the 30 billion with the reactive parameters. 

And I just, LM Studio comes with its own little chat window. You can chat with the model you just spun up. And so that this is running on my, so I'm in my house in Princeton, Texas, and I have a house in Forney, Texas, and that house has my PC in it my gaming PC. I just upgraded to have a 3090 because it has 24 gigs of GPU, but it's not even it's not using it right now This is supposed to be literally maxed right now, and this this should be like but this is still I'm just I'm just not Okay, so it is so it is so that's the thing so That's fantastically fast for this being memory. I'm actually in shock because that's how fast the Google one works on the GPU. 

When this one goes on GPU, it works at, it goes about 90 tokens per second, three times faster. So I just got to figure out why is this not loading on? So that's not it though. Okay, okay. Sometimes you have to select which one to use, right? Yeah, sometimes this is the problem. 

The CUDA, right? 

CUDA's the right one. There's two CUDAs. Hold up, guys. Yeah, CUDA's the NVIDIA thing, and I have NVIDIA. So let's just do this, whatever this other CUDA is. then I'll try asking around. 

So weird. Oh, oh, also, oh, I thought before we talked, I was looking into some, I was actually trying to run this before we connected and I thought maybe there was some clue. I was starting, I saw there was something in here. I remember seeing something about my paging size. That's why I started clearing out some, there it is right there. 

This seems very suspicious. 

This could be the problem. It says, Paging file is too small for this operation to complete, and so I was just clearing out some space to increase the paging, which is right here, change, 36 on both. Sometimes this makes you ask to see if you restart. Well, let's see if it changed actually. 

Hello. 

Some notches. Set? 

Ah, that was that. 

Okay, stupid Windows. Yeah, see, it's going to ask me to restart. So I will be right back. Let me just do this. Talk amongst yourselves. Just go to the game and then just look at some of the report. 

Go through the report, I guess. But yeah, I'll be right back. I'll join the call. Another thing, uh, so I think, um, I want to also go through the report. Um, and then, and then also what I can do is literally start the project that you want in front of you, and then you can sort of start it as well in your own environment in front of yourselves using the extension. Uh, and then start, cause he, cause you want to do it with JQR. 

So you got to go, go, you curate your JQR lists and stuff and get your data in line so that your AI knows what the fuck it's talking about. Yeah. Yeah. So. Good question. That's all called data transformation and stuff. 

Ultimately, Markdown is ideal. Yep. Whatever it is, convert it into Markdown. That's all my artifacts are Markdown. It works. It works really well. 

And so you can turn an Excel into Markdown. You can turn a PDF into Markdown. You can turn anything into Markdown. For your reference material, call it an artifact. Yep, so all these are artifacts. Everything is an artifact, even an entire prompt can then be put as an artifact itself, and then can be an example process. 

Do it again, but like this, you see what I'm saying? That's the power of an artifact, actually, thinking of things in this way. And then you can just convert it into a Markdown, So all that knowledge, that data in a markdown artifact that you can then talk about. Artifact number five, right? Make sure reference artifact number five when you put this together, right? Like I'm just speaking to the AI. 

Okay, so I'm just getting everything spun up again. Wait a minute, am I an idiot? I am an idiot. I restarted my, I didn't need to disconnect. I'm confused, I'm confused. Anyway, we're good. 

Did I restart the wrong machine? I restarted the wrong machine. i'm an idiot i didn't need to that's virtual machines man okay there it is okay okay so let me think get this through this one through because this is actually restarting the server okay now i'm on the same page so i would have to restart okay i don't want to do all that in front of y 'all that's not that's too um unnecessary I think it's way more valuable to and this is but this is this is the running models you don't necessarily have to do that and in the beginning you know a lot of your stuff can be just oh help help actually this is really easy I can help you set this up it's not it's not difficult I'm just trying to I'm just trying to square circle here okay let's go over here and let's just do this for a minute kind of go through like this speedrun, this thing. So the report came about after I made the game. I was making the game, having fun, putting this thing together, because I've been making AI, like I said, code with AI for three years, learning processes, learning how, you know, making a mental model of the model so I know what it's good at, what it could do, what problems it can solve, what problems it struggles at solving, those kinds of things. 

I invented the idea of cycles. to not rely on the conversation history, because the conversation history was garbage. And then that kind of spurred from there. Then I got the idea to make artifacts as a source of truth to be like something that was English, because we were writing code. So we would have English as an artifact source of truth that I would explain what I wanted, and then it would write it in the artifact, and then I would read the artifact. If it made sense to me, if I thought it was what I was asking for, I would say, OK, go build it. 

And then critique the results, you know and because I in my mind my theory was if the art if the artifact artifact correctly Describes the thing then it'll go do the thing correctly so a bit of a some of the vernacular because a cognitive capital and just look at some of this, turn that off, okay. The cognitive capital is the collective intellectual capacity, skill, and problem -solving, actually, let's see, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, can you hear this? The only problem with this is it's reading this first, which is a bit repetitive, but bear with it. We're just gonna go through a couple of these in this manner, and then we'll do the rest more, I just thought of the easiest solution to my problem. Let me just go start downloading the same model again, and then we'll come back. 

Go ahead, Quinn, 333. I think it was that one. No, it was this one. It was this one, yeah. this little okay yeah we want full gpu offload download all right oh it's downloading okay the entire internet is your hard drive this skipped something no no it's not it didn't skip so the problem here that this is going on here is uh so the working with ai the you a hidden curriculum that the current workforce model is a revolving door. 

There is no AI trainer job position. They're all content writers, because content writers are a very notoriously low -paid, low -skilled position. And so that's the job title. But yeah, yes, yes. And no, so not at Google. 

So what they do is they outsource the work that they need to another company, GlobalLogic, and then GlobalLogic concocts the jobs, breaks down it, what it does is it creates micro -tasks. 

So it breaks down the job into smaller tasks and then contracts those out to other companies. 

One of which I worked at, because I trained Google, I trained Gemini, I worked on this product. Anytime that this kicks off a... 

Anytime it shows you like a Google Maps, that's, I don't know if it's gonna actually give me a map or not. 

I worked on that Maps API. 

So show me the route. Show me the route. Oh, Timba, oh, it's, oh, my bad. 

I'm not thinking. 

I was thinking of, I was, no, no, no, I was thinking, I know it's wrong. I'm silly. It's not in America. 

I was thinking of, 

Albuquerque. I was thinking Bugs Bunny. He doesn't say Timbuktu. He says, he says left turn in Albuquerque. Okay. Okay. 

So yeah. Okay. But without the AI remote, yeah, there we go. No way, dude. The Google demo, dude, that's hilarious, dude. No demo ever works, dude. 

Oh, that's hilarious. Get out of here. Get out of here, dude. That's so fucking funny. Oh my god, yeah, uh, whatever. Fuck them. 

Anyway, anyway, anyway. So, um, so the problem though is that, so it's all contracted out, and so it's a revolving door, it's low paid, you do the work until you find some other better job and you leave, like I did, um, but that, and therein lies a problem, because I got these skill sets from working with AI for three years. That was only when GPT -3, uh, the new one, you know, the new Gintrib AI came out. Everything changed after that. All the kinds of data sets you need to create are different. Before it was drawing bounding boxes around images of pedestrians and saying, that's a person, that's a stoplight, that's a dog, that's a cat. 

You don't need English, you don't need a master's degree to do that kind of work. But that was before generative AI. Generative AI came along, and then now you need actual data sets of thinking and criticizing, change of thought, reasoning. We never had to create those data sets, they don't exist. So you can't have an AI that can be a thinking machine. if you don't have a thinking data set explaining how thinking works. 

And like having an example of a good... That's what we did. We annotated. That's what I did. I annotated what I wrote the trajectories out. you know, pretend to be an AI, essentially, and write out the trajectories of what would be a good, like, Google API call to answer the user's question in, like, five, six, seven steps, right? 

Versus just like a normal Google search. 

And so, with it being a revolving door, you'll never stay there long enough to gain the skill set that makes you 100x that I'm sitting here demonstrating with all the shit that I'm creating when I can't even write a single if statement, okay? 

And then also this comes into play because it's a low -paid, low -gig work. 

But the reality is then that adds financial stress, which decreases an individual's focus, reasoning abilities, or otherwise their cognitive capacity. And then so you have someone who's cognitively degraded, who's cognitively taxed due to the financial precarity of the position. training the AI that the rest of the world is using, the rest of the country is using, you can see how that's actually a recipe for disaster. And so the term, the concept that we need is this. Yeah, the data supply chain is what that falls under. 

The data supply chain. 

If you're outsourcing the person who's training your AI to some third world country, do they actually even care about the success or failure of the United States? Probably not. They're probably even closer, geographically speaking, to China. And China has much more influence on there. And we don't pay them. We pay them 50 bucks a month. 

So China shows up, a foreign intelligence service, gives them 60. Oh, that's my monthly salary. Sure, you can take a few screenshots of my computer, I don't mind. This is the solution. Where are we at? Okay. 

So any questions thus far? Yeah. Yes. That's down here, part five. Yeah. Yeah. 

Yeah. Cool. No, that's good. And I'm glad you're interested in that part. It's a really interesting, and I almost never get to that part of the story because it takes a while to get there, but yeah. So part one is the product, which I can gloss over because you've seen sort of the game. 

I haven't played the game in front of you. I did not make Angry Birds. I played the game in front of Cameron. He knows it's a bit and I barely played it in front of Cameron. Yeah, it's a it's a whole thing I made a whole thing. It's multiplayer. 

It's got a leaderboards. I could keep going. I could just keep going with it So the proof of the hundred and I did it in 110 days. Um, so that's kind of the Go down this way. So the hook is the artifact in your hands. 

The ascent report is tied to the game and The average productivity gains are measured like 20%. 

No, we're talking the citizen architect is 10 ,000 % gains. One person can do literally what you needed an entire team to do. Again, the revolutionary lead. 

We're in a choice right now. 

We're going to, because by Google's own admission, they expect a billion data labelers in the future because yes, that's how much data we're going to need to label in the future. And so if Google would love to have it where they keep paying the labelers next to nothing and reap all the rewards, whereas I'm offering a solution where we actually empower people and actually let people use the power to solve their own problems locally, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Citizen Architect is the path to do that, right? I'm proof. that some one person who cannot fucking code can do this. So yeah, they're tied together. 

The origin story, 120 days, literally, so March 25th is when Gemini 2 .5 Pro was released. I fiddled with the model for six days, and then I came up with the idea for the game on the sixth day, and then I spent three days planning out all the documentation. until I felt ready. So it's very simple. Here's the game I want to make. Let's make it like this other game. 

Do you know this game? Oh, you know this game? It's called Startup Company? Great. Okay, you know about it. Great. 

It's from 2017. Of course you would know about it. Great. Okay. I'm going to make a game just like that, but instead of making software products, we're just making AI products. So like Chatbot, Imagebot, blah, blah, blah, blah. 

Now let's make all the features from that game that we're going to need. So like they have components, they have HR systems, blah, blah, blah. So make a list of all the systems, make a list of all the components. Now make an artifact that describes each blah, blah, blah. Planned it all out. I spent three days. 

I watched YouTube videos. I found a YouTube video to help plan it out. This is how I got started. I found a YouTube video of someone playing the game. And that was like, there are many of them. I found one that had a decent coverage of the game, and I used that transcript. 

I just there you go There's my there's my one of my artifacts is this YouTube transcript. He's gonna use all the right language from that I reverse engineered my artifacts and created my own game So and I and I used a simple YouTube tutorial to make so you'll see the same game world right but Whereas he made an actual like a Pokemon little thing where like you walk in over here and it starts a Pokemon battle. I made an AI company right out of the whole thing. So all the pieces of the thing, I'm a one person studio. It's a paradigm shift in labor. One dude with AI with a vision can do everything that the entire team would do. 

This is what 100, this is what one million tokens looks like. This game, you're looking at it all up, it's about a million tokens. That's another thing is using the first AI models, they only had 1 ,000 tokens. So you can only get, stick, fit in them 1 ,000 tokens and have them crunch on those 1 ,000 tokens. Now they can crunch on a million tokens. So this is what's possible with the million tokens. 

It's kind of like NASA back in the day. How did NASA, you know, what was the hard drive? How many megabytes was the hard drive that got NASA to the moon, right? It was just a few, Megabytes, but all the software needed it was on that hard drive right because that's what the state of technology was Well now we measure state of technology and token count in my opinion. So this is this is this is a I Was so happy to make this image because for three years. This is how I felt when I was making my slack bot and 

I had this in my mind, but the image generation didn't exist three years ago. But I had this in mind. 

I felt like I was a kid again. 

I felt like I was sitting on like the matrix, the floor. And I was playing with Legos, but they were digital Legos. And I was combining the digital Legos to make my Slack bot. Because I was getting like this library, that library, Python, all these things, putting it all together. And then I had to build the actual website to deliver the Slack bot itself. Not to digress, this was my first project. 

You could try it, you could just add it to your Slack. It's probably, yeah, it's probably, yeah. Oh, it'll still, oh, they changed the process. So you have to request to install an unapproved app. Okay, who cares? But anyway, this was my project three years ago. 

This is what you'll be essentially copying and making into your own version. So you can see an example of it working. So I just created an example channel. What is this demonstrating up here? Example team channel. I mean I invite the bot and then I just say anything to it And then it will help you get it set up because it's I trained it that way thinking happy to assist you By using the set system message week, and then that's how you can train it in this channel All you do is type set system message and so for example You could say something like this channel includes experts in the field of AI the conversations often involve advanced AI and this is all this three years old but and then so this channel will be for an enablement team. 

So like what I was doing at Palo Alto Networks. This enablement team creates training content on technical products that the company builds. And so I'm talking with the AI, this was three years ago, talking with the AI to help set it up. This is revolutionary stuff at the time. This was prophetic. 

This was visionary stuff. Now it's just because it didn't exist at the time. I was putting it together. Excellent to summarize. So it gave me a set system message. It gave me a system message now I could write for this channel. 

I just copied and pasted. This channel dedicated enablement team focused on creating technical content. Should adopt informed persona ready to answer questions about instructional design. And so I'm just doing it correctly. Now it's set. The channel system message has been set. 

So I'll literally give you the Python script. You can take it and use it as one of your artifacts. Yeah, that's what I created. It could also be, you could also invite it to your own channel, any channel. You can, you absolutely see. So guess what? 

All you would need to do, I turned DMs off. I decided to turn DMs off at the time. So you could make a different architecture design decision for your project. No problem there, dude. 

That's one of your cycles. 

You're going to spend some cycles. 

Now let's make it so the users can DM the bot. 

Okay, let's go. See what I'm saying? So there you go. You're getting there. You're starting to see it. So you can start with mine as a blueprint, you see, and then make it for your use case. 

And this is only a part of it, so there's two pieces of it. See, can you explain playbooks to a new XOR at CSE? So as a new customer success engineer, trying to learn XOR, boom, bada bing, bada boom. Now the user has a fucking, dude, this was revolutionary shit, okay? And all I did was set it up right in front of them. of you okay and then um the premium feature so the premium feature was the knowledge base i i did rag before i even knew it so here it is what is cortex xim cortex xim was a product that was came out literally two months after. 

It was all secret hush hush at Palo Alto until one month, January 21 or whatever. And that was the training cutoff time was December of 2020 or whatever for the AI. So literally, literally hush hush secret product launch a month after the AI training data cutoff date. Because, oh, well, yes, yes. Yeah, you're sharp. Yeah, go ahead. 

You're sharp. 

Go ahead. You tell me what's going on. Yep. Yeah, that's right. Precisely. Yes, it is. 

It's fucking crazy. It's crazy for that to exist today. Never mind I made this three years ago. And it fell on deaf ears, bro. The capability is literally at your fingertips. It's whatever data you bring, whatever data you curate, whatever data you curate. 

See the step I was showing you, all the checking? It's not just checking files. You can go get Excel files. You can go get your JQRs, drop them in a folder, and then use VS Code on that folder as a repo. And then just select that file for your JQR. And then when you ask your AI to make you to, you have a question on, well, I don't know what the fuck you do with JQRs, but I use them in my work and they're annoying. 

And I, every time I just download the XLS and I just have it in my, as an artifact. And I, you know, make my list of JQRs that way. And it's fucking, I just spot check it after. Yep. So yeah, it's exactly what happens in here. 

So I don't need to explain anymore. 

You got it. So yeah, you I'll just it's 1000. It's 1000 line. I made it with I made it with three years ago. So the AI could only be so big, right? It could only take so many tokens. 

It's a tiny fucking script. It's a tiny fucking project. And I was able to do it. So yeah, with the net AI now, it's it'll be a joke. Absolute joke. Especially when you have Yeah. 

I'm done. I'm rambling. I'm transitioning back. I'm transitioning back to where we were. Yes, they are. 

It's public. 

No, it's on the internet. You go download them. 

No, that's another thing. 

That's beautiful. That's a beautiful question. That comes from you playing with the AI, and that's what you will build as a mental model of the model. So you will simply know, and you're playing with it when you're making your project. When you have a DNS problem and it's answering you and solving, you'll get an, oh yeah, dude, yeah, you'll have categories of knowledge. that you'll, in your own mind, you'll know intuitively, oh yeah, the AI's got this, but I'll need to bring this to the table. 

Great question. Great, great, great, yeah. So it's great at troubleshooting DNS and handling those kinds of problems, especially when you do the legwork and actually bring the right DNS data to the table. right, from out of your DNS system. Like for example, I use Namecheap to host this server you're looking at in front of you at aisin . game that you can visit. 

I'm hosting it all locally. 

The only thing that's not local is the thing I can't do by myself, which is the DNS. 

And so I have an artifact for my game. Oh yeah, I've restarted, which is fine. I haven't restarted this thing in ages. So, I have an artifact in my game that captured all that DNS information. There you go. I have an artifact that has all the information from my local LLM, so it knows what URL to use, so I never have to bring it back to the, I brought it once. 

I've curated that data. It's in an artifact. I would do it, oh, this is great. This is the answer to your question. Here's the barometer. Here's the validation check. 

Hallucinations, hallucinations. First, start with no data. Easy peasy, breezy beautiful. Start with no data. And then ask it for whatever the fuck you want, because you don't know. Maybe it can do. 

Yeah. And then no, no, not even that. Not even that. Not even that. Yes. Yes, that is a pro. 

But I'm going I'm going I'm going I'm I'm I'm zooming out even further than that to do it even quicker, faster, better, stronger. Listen, you just ask it for the result for the product that you want. And then you look at it because, you know, let me give an example yeah and then you see what it's meant that's what shows you what it's missing the yes with the knowledge it has that you don't need to bring yes yes good good yes you can clearly see because it's got a bunch of wrong fucking jq ours ah oh I'll just go okay I'll just go get the jq ours I and then boom ask the same question with that artifact at the bottom added see what happens All right, and let me go back to my Slack bot because that's actually how I came up with the idea for it in the first place. The origin of the idea was, I asked it, because I was working at Palo Alto, my job was to create training curriculum for XOR. And so I asked the latest and greatest AI, do you know what XOR is? 

Yes, it's a security orchestration automation. Oh great, okay, so it knows what XOR is. Do my job, make me a playbook training. And then it was horrible, it was terrible. And then I thought about it and then I just opened up the publicly facing XOR admin guide and I did a control F. for the word playbook and any paragraph or paragraph above or below or whatever section that mentioned the word playbook I just copied it and put it into a text document and then and then asked the same question make me a training on playbooks and then it was almost perfectly usable I was like what the fuck if I could somehow automate this process somehow and so I just went to YouTube and I and I and I found one video in particular from this genius dude 74 lines of code where it's a bringing up because he has a great diagram. 

It's a bird, this bird, this. So he created, this is rag. I don't know if he even knows this is rag because I didn't know it was rag and I watched the video. But we made this, he made this, where in 74 lines, it will take a PDF, extract the content, split it into chunks, number the chunks, turn them into embeddings, which are just vectors, like this. I'm going to turn something into an embedding right here, just so you can visually see what a vector or string it all is. This is a sentence that is purposely misspelled to break words up. 

Yeah, see? They're almost all not broken up. That's the only one. First, I just wrote a sentence. The first step is to see which So it's 66 characters up here, but down here it's only 17 tokens, and each color is one of the tokens. So this is a token, space is is a token, space a is a token, so on and so forth. 

And then each token has an ID, and so each of the 17 tokens is now just represented as a number. So that's all that this, this is actually just 851. So if we ever, if any repetition, if we had any repeated words in here, word, word, word, word, three of them, they're all gonna be identical, 2195, 2195, 2195. It's just, that's it, this is symbolic, that's all it is. Yep, and this is a vector, this is an embedding, that's all it is. Easy peasy. 

And so where were we else? We were somewhere. Yes, that's where we were. That's right. So that's what an embedding is. So it turns each chunk, which is 1 ,000 characters, into an embedding, which is a string like that. 

And this is an embedding model. And nowadays, you can have a local model do this. It's very, very easy. I have an IBM one. And so you can do this. You don't need to make any money. 

This doesn't cost anything anymore. You can do this locally. Create these embeddings. And you create a semantic index. And then that gets put into a knowledge base file, which is just a . index file and then a . 

json file. And then now, once you have this, the user asks a question. 

The question itself gets turned into another embedding. 

And then that embedding, now you have an embedding that you can compare the numbers against the other numbers, and in a process called a semantic search. The library is Facebook AI Semantic Search. It's phenomenal. What it's doing is it finds which chunks are the most semantically similar to the user's question, and then, you know, you select the top seven, and then it'll just add those. Just like I said, append them to the question, to the user's question. So the user asks the question, and then the knowledge base gets Picked out the few pieces because the book is too damn big. 

Book's too big for the AI's context. Even a million tokens is too much sometimes. This is not enough. And so you have a knowledge base. Rank the results. Generate. 

Answer. Get the answer. That's what's going on. He did it in 74 lines. I took that. I wrote it up. 

I copied what he wrote. I wrote it down. as he wrote it and then I took that and then XR first off I had already made my slack bot I already made the version one that you saw where you could do the system message and then I because I knew my second step now I have the bot now I want to do the PDF so then I had this I wrote the 74 lines and I brought that to the equation see I have, now I see, I data curated this solution. Now how, and I have no idea how to do it in Slackbot. I don't know how I'm going to do it with Slackbot. I don't know. 

And so I, we started working on it and ended up with a solution. It worked. And so all you do is you type slash file upload and it pops up that little modal that, if I open a new, it'll refresh, refresh. But whatever, you saw, it pops up the modal. And I didn't even know the word modal. I didn't know the word model, and so I'm learning the vocabulary. 

Now, making models is no big deal. I make models all the time. I made many models for my video game, for my AISN game. No big deal. I know what to ask for. That's the learning in the moment. 

That's the in -situ learning. And that's the origin of the idea for the Slackbot, and all the way through, 74 lines or whatever. 

And so you'll just take my, just like I took his 74 lines, you're gonna take my 1 ,000 and run with it, okay? 

yeah yeah right on so okay so that's i literally felt like this i was so this was my favorite one to make i genuinely genuinely feel like this you will too uh very soon um the how live coding to virtuosity virtuosity simply means it's like maestro like someone like an artist a piano a piano player makes it look easy right their finger like it looks to them easy right what they're but that's because of all the years of practice you haven't you have not seen um that's the same thing here uh case in point um this is an example of this was literally the first image that i made this was the first image that i made for this report and then after making over a thousand images i then came back and realized i need like the cover page i need any words like i can do words i didn't even realize i could do words i could do words that don't misspell Now I made the cover page, right? Way different, right? Versus the, what do the gloves mean? Like, I don't know, like this one doesn't have gloves. Does that mean anything? 

What does it mean? That's the thing. Oh, the artistry, like me, you know, what is the artist trying to convey? You can convey so much. I learned this over time. This is one of my favorites. 

Over time, you know, oh, well, it's a cover, you know? Even starting to get the text to be like, this is all AI. I didn't put this. This is AI generated, bro. Maybe like, look, I just found a typo. No, it's not a typo. 

It's correct. Earn and learn. That's correct. 

See? 

Good to go. Maybe like, I have to do maybe some little tiny edits. It's really minuscule. I mean, this is beautiful. Look at the fuck. Look at all the detail. 

Look at all the content, context. You know, this is the ThreadingPress 2 .0. The way I did this, I don't need to go through the way I did everything, but images are great. 

If you ever need to make images, I can show you how to do that. 

Yeah. 

the brilliant, the trillion, billion worker opportunity. Anyway, so this is the plan. This is the plan. You guys are going to be on this side of the equation. 

You guys are going to be the DC. 

I'm skipping. 

I'm skipping, but let's skip. This is a good skip. I'm going to turn you guys into the dcia you're going to be you you already are in this state you're already the intelligence analyst that's what you're here for um but then i have learned the skills to be the data curator i've made a fucking tool to data curate to carry data and then you will be able to use it to be a fucking dcia data curator intelligence analyst And just fucking know every answer to every fucking pro - Like you said, this guy knows every fucking - Cause I - Cause I - Cause I did - I use AI to research all that shit, dude. I didn't know any of these words. I didn't know any of this shit. 

You know, I just fucking read the responses. I actually sat to fucking read it. It's not too much for me to read. Okay? So, uh, yeah. So that's the plan there. 

Uh, uh... We were over here... Um... Vibe Coding Virtuosity... Uh, yeah, that's a good switch. Okay, so, yeah. 

Good stuff. Good stuff. We're about right here. Yep. Yep. Same stuff. 

AI's the producer, you're the strategist. Yep. Yes. In any direction. You're right. Mm -hmm. 

I didn't mention this, I delivered this into strategic partner training. I delivered the bot actually in a training course. So I have a GIF of it. Is this the GIF? Okay, I have a GIF of it where I went through every single question, I recorded every single question that every single user asked. But you can see, this was Rob, this was one of the SMEs at Palo Alto Networks. 

He was ex -military, whatever, he was one of the really important people at the company. And so he was in there testing it, you know, can you give me an overview of XIM? And again, XIM is a product that the real AI knew nothing of, so any answer it comes up with could only have come up with it because I had that PDF solution. Only way. And so here it is, exact, correct. I was sitting four seats away when he asked this question, and I was looking at his face when he asked it, And he turned and he looked at me with like the thumb, like the kid on the computer with the thumbs up. 

Dude, it was that. It was that kid on the computer with the thumbs up. It was that meme. Yeah, dude, legit. He's like, okay. And he asked another follow -up question. 

Because I trained it to always suggest follow -up questions for the user. And then he just literally just copied one. 

That's what I wanted. 

He just copied one and just was exactly. And then asked another question later. So yeah, exactly. So I delivered strategic partner. 

I forget who was in the room. 

IBM, SB6, Deloitte, some Mexican telcos were all represented. They were all interested in using XIM. They all purchased it and they were in there for two years. And I literally, I don't wanna digress, but I literally turned the training around, dude. A month before, it was a disaster, specifically the labs. And I came in and I made the labs, but then I also made the bot. 

I delivered this bot as a sole contributor, icing on the cake, this is what you do, this is what you get when you add David to the project, right? Like what the fuck like this? Yeah, and then I ended up losing my job. Uh, uh, there's no fault. Yeah Yeah, dude, so crazy dude in a reduction in force. They cut half the team the other half. 

Uh, uh, they just finished cutting actually, uh, one of my colleagues just got let go the one who survived the first round got let go just a few months ago, so Yeah, um, not good. Not good. But uh, anyway, so back to This uh, yeah the innovative starting point make it cool You don't know how or what or why. What you do have, though, is you have human taste. You have taste. You can say, I don't like this. 

Make it different. You don't know the right language yet. That's where this comes in. You start to learn the design vocabulary. You start to have a more structured interaction. And then now, even after you've built one or two things, you can even have a hole in the mindset of what you're going to need to build because this is the third time you've done an authentication system. 

Yeah. So Citizen, this is the end state. Let's just listen to this one, I guess. Looks like I might have fixed it. Yeah, I fixed it. Yeah. 

Okay, so we can blitz through this because it's not too relevant, but it's relevant to me. It was a lived experience for me. It affected me actually. I sometimes get choked up going through this section, but it's not a good work environment. It's not good to be building a piece of the future. And you can't even be a part of that. 

So it really sucks. And so the problem, though, so it actually becomes a problem, though, because it actually is institutionalized garbage in, garbage out. And when you have that bad system of untrained people who just act, okay, oh, let me, let me, this is how it's so bad. I can, I got the, okay. The first, when I started, the task was only 1 ,000 tokens max, because the AI could only take 1 ,000 tokens. Like, that's 4 ,000 characters. 

That's a conceivable thing, but now the AIs are a million tokens. Now the task's 1 ,000, 40 ,000, 40 ,000 lines, or was it say 40 ,000 tokens? But you only have three hours to do the task. And the training, by the way, I was a senior reviewer, right? So some of the argument might be, oh, well, they have like a review process to weed through the bad responses. Yeah, dude, you're talking to that senior reviewer. 

I know the system. 

Guess what training I got? 

I got basic English grammar training to be a senior reviewer. It was like, what the fuck? Where's my training on how, like, what is chain of thought reasoning and all the actual, like, actual thing that I would have to be professionalized? I would be machine learning terminology. They can't have that, then they would have to pay me more. So it's institutionalized garbage in, garbage out, okay? 

And the daily quota just goes up. They keep squeezing, since making it a nonsensical system. It's architecture of self -sabotage in AI development pipeline. This is why the AIs get stupider over time. I don't know if you've noticed that with chatGBT. That's because that's what's happening, okay? 

And you can, so the reinforcement learning with human feedback is the post -training. So the AIs, unless you do very good post -training, right? If you do a bad job, you can make them stupider. Let me give an example. Have you heard of MechaHitler? MechaHitler? 

It was it was a it was a yes. Yes. Yes. 

Yes. Yes. 

Yeah, that's what happens. Yeah. Yeah. 

Because they started fucking because they were feeding it garbage. 

They were they were they were that they were that was reinforcement. That was post training. They were that was post training. Oh, me test. Oh, yeah. That yeah, that's discord. 

That's happened sometimes. Is it better now? Yeah, it's probably just a No, that's that was me normal. That's me normal. No, no. So anyway, this is what's going on. 

We're courting disaster because the higher the technology gets, the more people rely on it. And that when it does have a catastrophic failure, the more exposed and the worse that the harder the fall. OK, so this is just a prediction of mine that China will win the AI race because of the fissured workplace and the institutionalized garbage in and garbage out. This is me, this is my theory, and this is because I lived through it, I did it, and I found the glass ceiling, okay? The negative feedback loop. 

I was literally rubber stamping the responses, dude, I could care less, I could care fucking less. OK, and I'm smart and I believe in all this stuff and I love AI. But I got to the point where I could care fucking less. And I bet I'm not the only one who could care fucking less. OK, I just want to get my paycheck and go home because I don't get paid enough to care. And I'm an American. 

Never mind the foreigners doing this job. OK. OK. It's a whole it's a whole. And again, you can't you. So anyway. 

Yeah. Then you look at China. What is China doing? So then I thought then. So I started using deep think. No, no, no. 

Deep research, because Google's released deep research. 

And that's how I came up with the fissured workplace. 

I didn't know it was this bad. 

I thought I was just the only idiot who tried to get a promotion and only got himself more work to become a senior reviewer. No, actually, there was a whole, it's a whole, like, there's a union. I joined the union. I'm working with the leadership there. So you guys are the top. I'm working with the bottom. 

I'm grassroots. 

I'm trying to, you know, so, but that's not the topic. I thought with deep research, after doing some research on American companies and exposing some of that, because there's now a class action lawsuit that started in May. on the supplier for Meta and OpenAI. They're at scale. They're in a lawsuit right now for the exact same reason, misclassification of labor. That's the complaint. And wage theft is the complaint, which is, yeah, checks out. 

Yeah, that's my lived experience, yeah. So it's hopefully, hopefully, hopefully, hopefully America can right itself. the system. But I don't think so, man. Google is the strongest, the most rich company in the world. I think they're going to get everything that they want. 

But what is China doing? That inflection was annoying, but who cares? Interesting. So I've never changed it while I was playing. 

Hold up. 

There we go. Okay, it's fixed. Let me just connect the dots here. What was that? 

Let's do it this way. 

Have you all seen this? 

Yeah. 

Yeah. Yep. Yep. This is the poorest region in China. Never have they done any investment of any kind here. It's the poorest because look at all the fucking mountains. 

So they are alleviating their poorest region. They're about to make it the richest region. All right, what the fuck? What? I can do that. I could do that if I had a bunch of people listening. 

Because they see the power. They're going to make an undeniable case. They've already done it. They're already using it. It already is. It already is. 

It already is over there. They already have the base made. And they've already got workers working there, training AI, promoting themselves, getting AI training, and becoming a profession. Over here, we're trying to keep the prices low, OK? And then also, why are they doing this? the big ass two, the two, two, two, two of them. 

I don't know if you've seen that. Cause that's where they're building, that's where they're building their data centers. Okay. Okay. In the desert, in the fucking desert. Okay. 

Like we're like, oh, projects guys wake up. Okay. All right. All right. So inline sourcing, so poverty alleviation, secure data pipelines, not outsourced, data annotation as poverty alleviation, insulating the supply chain. professionalization of the workforce. 

You get certifications. They've been, they professionalized it five and a half years ago in that document when it came out. And they actually, in China, it's an actual, yeah, right there. Administrative Human Resources and Social Security in China, officially added data annotator and related titles like AI trainer to the national. That's what I am, you know, but it doesn't really, I don't have, there's no position like that in America, okay? There's a false dichotomy in America of what it is. 

They're content writers. There's the gray beards, yeah, you go ahead, in America. So I would say, I would say, because I didn't get to interact with them, the Google engineers, I had to get it filtered through a non -technical person, which is, but they are taking the datasets created by the teams making the datasets and then they are embedding them and using them as fine -tuning. Kind of what I've showed you. Kind of what I do. Yeah, larger scale. 

Yeah, exactly. Larger scale because AI, if it has not seen the problem, it hallucinates. If there's no training data, it hallucinates. And so, but my argument is even if Google gets their wish, their way, I think the deluge of data is going to be so much. Do you know the story of the ATM machine when that came about? So, so the ATM machine, the automatic teller machine, you know, back in the day, that was one of the first machines that, you know, like of automation that took a job and nevermind like tractors and shit. 

This is like, like a worker, like a, like a office worker. Uh, and so there was a big fear that, Oh, all the tellers are going to lose their jobs. Oh no, no, no. Well, what happened once they started deploying them, the demand for banking services went up and then they wanted banks and all this stuff. cities instead of just in the main cities and all the towns. And so there was a big influx in the need of tellers, actually, because yeah, you'd still have your ATM, but then you'd still have your tellers. 

So the demand rose, and that was an encounter for it. I argue the demand is going to rise for curation of datasets. Case in point, I always use this example. The hairstylist is going to have glasses that has a camera that records every moment in every day, and then they're going to stream live on Twitch, and there's going to be a viewer of two. One is them, and two is their AI. They'll train their AI that this is the right clipper to use, that's the wrong clipper to use, and then after that, when their apprentice shows up and puts on the glasses, the AI will see what they're about to cut. 

Uh -uh, that's the wrong clipper, because it's got the training data. But you can't do that before. You can't do that. put the car before the horse. So you have to, yeah, you gotta first have the hours of cutting hair, and then you gotta annotate it, and then you gotta feed it to an LLM. First you gotta have an LLM, right? 

See? To even think to do something, with the stupid data haircuts, right? So yeah, it's just all of a sudden, valueless data becomes hyper -valuable. That's what I said, internet is your hard drive. Everything needs to be reinvented, mix -matched, you know? Do it like this, but like that. 

I want to make a startup company, but for AI. 

Everything, the whole world is reinvented now. You guys are going to get the toolkit to do it. But this is an example of what it is. One side builds a ladder, the other side builds a labyrinth. Because I wasn't able to get promotion. I wasn't able to get recognized. 

Clearly, I'm recognizable. Clearly, I'm recognizable. I could not get recognized, even in the lion's den. I found the glass ceiling. I was screaming at the top. I'm showing them what I'm building. 

They don't give a fuck. I stopped showing them. I stopped telling them. I stopped sharing with them my secrets and shit. Now I'm doing it for myself. You see what I'm saying? 

Like, it's not good. If I was at Google getting the full -time and fucking all the benefits, the six -time salary that my research has shown, because, okay, this is how I did it. This is how I figured it out. I was doing the job. I was there doing the job, using AI to do the job. And I thought, I was like, wait a minute, what job, if this was a job, what was this job title be? 

Can you define this work?" And it said, yeah, this would be an AI quality analyst. This is blah, blah, blah, the job range, pay range, 120, 150, benefit, blah, blah, blah, found equivalence positions at Google. Meanwhile, I'm over here 21 an hour as a content writer with a master's in cybersecurity, like by its own admission. by its own admission you know based off the actual work being done clear misclass labor misclassification so that they can make money in the split so that global logic can make money in the split between what Google pays and what they pay me so yeah so this is what's happening bro so people like me never get to grow mentally because they're so cognitively taxed I got lucky I got out of it I got the job. I got the job at UKI to be here with you guys. 

So, yeah. So that's why it matters. That's why I'm screaming at the top of my lungs. That's why I stopped making a game and started making other shit. Yeah. This is my favorite, the open source Trojan horse. 

Open source Trojan horse. And I did all, you know, I did my, oh, I didn't get to tell this part. So I keep getting sidetracked. So deep research, Google, I use it to do the, fissured workplace and all that. And then I think, I have the thought, your English is pretty good, your research is pretty good, but how's your Mandarin? I want you to go do research on Chinese domains. 

Tell me about how China's doing their AI. 

I sent deep, I turned deep research into an OSINT tool instantly. 

And it started feeding me all this shit, like here's the companies that Deep Seek uses, and here's where they get their talent from, and here's who's using it, the police and the hospitals that they're using it for, and you know, like, dude. And here's their plan, and here's how they spell it in fucking Chinese and shit. Like, yeah dude, their whole doctrine. So, so, good question, good question. At that point, I didn't check this. This, I gut checked it. 

It checks out with what I... Oh, and also, I opened these documents. So here's this. This is translated by Stanford, right? So I can read the documentation. I have the sources where they got the research from, the deep research tool. 

I kept track of it and did my citations and everything. But a lot of it is, the tool is actually really good. And also what I do is I do parallel processing. So I'll do the same query multiple times and one of the trajectories may go off the rails and the other ones don't. And so that's the one that I use. That's the research paper I use. 

So in the moment when I get the research back, I'm reading the results and I'm going through them then. But I also, I don't just have one result. I have four, I have five, I have six identical conversations where I opened one conversation and I sent the same prompt multiple times. And that's part of my process. It's part of my validation process. And it's one of the key leverages that you'll see that I built into my tool. 

It's built into the tool, so you'll just get to use it. And you'll see the power as you do it. You'll see. To answer your question, that's how. But when you see it, you'll know. Because I diff it as well. 

I use WinMerge to diff things. 

I don't have it set up to demo it, but yeah. 

I could, but it's not real. It's more relevant in the shit when we're making it, not right now. Um, okay. So yeah. So they're making, yeah. they're making a huge fusion with the military, right? 

Of course they are, why wouldn't they? So they stole our H -100s and they went to deep -seek, where's the, yeah, they went to deep -seek and then they're being installed in this desert. 

This is the company that stole them. 

Oh, and NVIDIA doesn't have a backdoor. That's cognitive security in a nutshell. 

You can tell NVIDIA is not thinking cognitive with cognitive security because China just stole their GPUs and now they're going to use them against us. 

So one more thing. Good question. To your question, how do you know? Because it is Chinese. 

I understand that completely. 

Remember, it was a lived experience for me. I went through the entire U . 

S. freaking like training thing and like know what it is. And me of all like I'm a precocious guy. 

I'm a smart guy. 

I can make my way to the top. But there it's actually a glass ceiling. versus what the research told me about China's model fucking checks out, dude. Checks out. And even if it's not true, it's what we should do. Yeah, so I have that edge. 

It's a lived experience for me. I actually trained Gemini. Okay, just repeat that one. What, six seconds? Whatever. Sometimes it repeats. I didn't go back and perfect this report. 

I was building the entire thing from scratch, including the report viewer. Yes. Let's get down here now. So now that, yeah, China exists. Got it, okay. A quick and easy understanding of data poisoning is if you have any training data where the AI is responding angrily, that poisons the shit out of your model. 

That is data poisoning. An example of how easy it is to poison your data. Just a few examples of AI responding angrily in your data set can make it happen out in the wild. And that is where you get in the news. Yeah, yeah, let's do this one too. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, so this image actually this was one of the first images I made for one of the first reports that I made I Like the way I really like just the way it came out just because it was one of the first ones I made but I liked it almost looks like he's like, you know wearing war painting or something. 

It looks pretty cool. Anyway, let's just move on to just repeating. Yeah, this is a good one Okay, it's the new one. I'm just learning how to skip it while it's playing. Maybe I'll pause it next time. 

This is an important one. Let's go to this one. I think I just need to click this. It automatically does it. This is an important one here. Nice. 

You played yourself, and you played us. This is one of my favorite pictures, actually. I love the way it came out. The data annotation jobs that, you know, create the cognitive capital because you're learning how to work with an AI. We're transferring those jobs overseas, and so go with it, all the sensemaking. That's the idea there, I think. 

Ah, part five. Okay, UBA. 

The second one, this one. 

There was one of these. I don't mean to detract. There was one of these that was a really good article. I was trying to find it. This is worth just going through nice and slow. This is the last chapter. 

It's worth it. It's where all the, like, how we can, how we need to reconceptualize things. And I'll be right back while it's playing. My wife wants to talk to me right back. 

Sorry, I'm back. 

Did something happen with this thing? Oh, sorry. Probably. Oh, wait a minute. No, no, no, no. 

I was just seeing if maybe it was my headset. 

What were you saying? I'm gonna make it stop. I'm not, sorry to interrupt. Jesus, it's annoying. Okay, sorry about that. Yeah, yes, dude. 

I didn't do it that time. That time I didn't do it. Okay, no, okay, no, yes. You're right, you're seeing the vision. You're absolutely right. You're right, anything. 

The cycles, the cycles and the artifacts. I'm not touching it. It's just started. My hand's not even on the keyboard and mouse right now. I'm gonna need to refresh this thing. It's going crazy, okay. 

Yeah. No, that's it. That's really it. It's the cycles and the artifacts, the process, the methodology, that's it. And then the practice in that, because you need to, what does practice in that look like? That's you reading the AI's response and then discerning the differences, the good responses versus the bad ones. 

There are different ways you do that. It's all in validation. Easiest way to do that is with a code, because you can take the code, put it in your project, and do you get TypeScript errors? No. Yes, that's a validation step in and of itself, but you can be an idiot and do that. Yeah, almost. 

No one would listen to you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm here at, and you, what do I hear a voice? Why is my other, oh, then my audio for my YouTube is playing. Yeah, that's his voice. There it is. 

My audio is going crazy, dude. 

Something, my audio, man. 

Yeah, my audio, dude. Everything is playing, I don't know. 

Okay, so, yes, all good comments. 

And yes, I mean, seriously, I, all my, okay, yes, I did work at Palo Alto Networks, but it was only for a year. Like, I had just gotten my master's in cybersecurity, or my bachelor's in cloud computing. I had literally just gotten it. Clearly, I'm a very technical person, because I've always played with computers. My mom worked for Dell. 

But I've never had the credentials or the job title to qualify for it. 

So at Palo Alto Networks, I was just hired to be a customer success engineer. But in the class of 18, I was the top student. 

And I was actually hired to be a tech. 

I was actually offered a position on the team that put the academy together. And so that thus began my teaching and enablement. in cybersecurity journey. So I got really, really, really lucky to get that opportunity. And I tried really, really, really hard, because that's what I do. And I tried to reach the top. 

And I did a good job. And I got to be that position. And then Apollo, they let me go. I got my master's in cybersecurity in three months out of spite, I was pissed off. And then after that, I was I got the position barely at Google, because the requirement is a master's contract position. 

And then Did the same thing there, got to the top, realized it's an actual glass door, holy shit, found a real job, paying job at UKI. 

Got really lucky with that position in that interview that they heard me and they were listening. And so they offered me a position and I learned true coding as an engineer in my title, making these labs for you guys. And they really gave me that opportunity. I'd never had engineer before. title before. And so, yes, I did it. 

I learned all of it. I could not have done it without AI. Yes, I bullshit my way right up in there, but you fake it until you make it. You know? Yeah, man. Yeah. 

So let's see if she's going to give us grief this time. The pathway. Let's see. Oh, so no, no, no, no, no, no. This is a table. This is a table. 

We'll just look at it. Yeah, maybe that's why it got wonky. Yeah. Let's see. Let's see how it goes. Let's see. 

Let's see. Let's see. 

Okay, the typical output of a Sage 1 .5 coder would be labeled data points, simple annotations. 

This was the, I was joking with Cameron, half joking, half serious, when I said even the gooners will grow because a lot of people are going to make a lot of raunchy stuff with this AI. A lot of, you know, hey, what drove the internet was the porn industry or the VHS tapes, right? So yeah, whatever. But my argument is.. a lot of people say that's such a waste. Dude, on Reddit, dude, there's one guy in particular, it's so funny. 

When there's those weird -ass gooners making their posts. Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, there's this one guy who always shows up and he just reams on these gooners. And he's like, you guys are so filthy, sick individuals. You're wasting the AI. 

You're ruining the AI for all of us, all this stuff. And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, dude. Even the gooners will grow because they're going to make so many waifu pictures that they can't keep track of which ones. And then they're going to have to start labeling their data sets, labeling data. They're going to start gaining the skill set, dude. Even the gooners will grow. 

And then eventually, they'll become stage two. Maybe they'll make a website to ship. Yeah, maybe they'll give her a waifu, give her a voice, bro. You see where I'm going with this? It's not crazy. It's not crazy, all right? 

Even the gooners will grow, okay? Yeah, even the gooners will grow. But I'm not going to make that a slide. And in fact, I swear to you, dude, this was funny. It's so easy to poison a data set. Holy shit, I said that to the AI when I was making this and shit. 

Trying to frame how I want my arguments. You don't get this from just asking AI to make a training on AI. You do not get this. This is a lot of work of me working on to produce this language. One of the phrases I said, even the Gooners will grow, and I gave my Gooner speech to the AI, and dude, it started putting like titles as fucking Gooner, putting Gooner as the title and shit, and fucking Gooner all over the place, and I'm like, no dude, you can't, I was talking to you, dude, you cannot say Gooner, you cannot say Gooner in my fucking report. okay? 

You can't say that. So I just had to end up taking it out, dude. But I just thought about that's data poisoning, bro, in a nutshell. One fucking bit about Gooners and then the AI just keeps throwing Gooner in my fucking responses, dude. 

So it is, it is, it is actually, yeah, yeah. 

I didn't think of it until I explained it to you that way. But yeah, so stage two is the AI apprentice, the data technician. Their core skills are structured prompting, use of data annotation tools, basic quality checks, identifying simple inconsistencies. Their mindset is, is this correct? 

Like you asked already, you already asked that question, how do you verify that stuff, right? 

So their typical output is clean datasets, verified annotations, and basic quality reports. So reports of a basic quality. Stage three, journeyman developer, the data steward. These are, this is, The core skills are system design for data pipelines. I make scripts to help me make my prompt, to package the, before I made my extension, right, I started making simple scripts because copying and pasting the same file into the next conversation was too tedious. I started making, first I just started using a text file, that in and of itself was stage one tool. 

And then I started making scripts that would combine for me the multiple files I started saving. I started having to save things in multiple files as projects grew, and then instead of copying and pasting five files manually, I made a script that would just combine them, and so on and so forth. How does the data fit into the larger system? That's the approach, the mindset. All output is well -structured, validated, documented data sets, and some data governance frameworks. At a stage four, citizen architect. 

Strategic oversight of data ecosystem, complex systems, orchestration, cog sec principles, adversarial data testing, synthetic data generation, all the good stuff. Data should exist and why? Like that's asking that question like you sort of did ask that actually. Like does it need to know about DNS? That's the mindset. 

You will learn that with this process when you get up to here. You will just know. You will know the AIs are capable in that realm, but this is the realm that you're going to need to start curating data for. You're just going to know this intuitively. And you do it as you, yeah, you will. You'll figure it out. 

It's actually a fun learning experience. Building your own mental model of the model. The outputs are robust, secure, high -quality, AI -ready knowledge bases and with resilient data pipelines. Yep. Valuable career path. Yep. 

Human firewall. Ultimate security layers. Human. We'll get to that. Yeah. These are the initiatives. 

So we'll get there. Duty. I never heard that one yet. That's funny. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, basically that. 

Once you got your shit curated, ask any fucking sentence, any question. And again, the power of this is you can pivot. You can ask for literally anything. Like, I had my whole project, my data curation environment, the prompt that I was using to make it, right? So I had the prompt, my artifacts, and my code, and then I just pivoted with the same prompt. I said, We're making a white paper now. 

We're making a white paper on this extension, and the benefits that this extension can bring to a corporate environment, to corporate work, working and making things like the labs I design, and anyone making anything, like you say, literally anything. And so I made an artifact that outlined how the white paper should be. I worked on that. I made a rough draft of the white paper, and then I made the actual white paper. And then I took the white paper itself, and then I sanded it. make three different image prompts for each section of the white paper. 

And then I took each one of those image prompts, one at a time, and made them. So then the white paper had this white paper. Literally, it's one tab away. It's this one. I made this in an evening, a few days ago during while I was up there in Maryland, right? In the evening while I was working on other shit, I put this thing together, right? 

for Eric, who is the bald guy. But I don't know how much he's going to absorb, right? But I put that together in an evening that in and of itself is a point. So this is all about the extension that I made. How amazing is this? My own Parallel Copilot panel described in this white paper and envisioned in this image. 

It's actually quite remarkable. The fact that you can actually just pick and select, check, I want this file, I want this file. Quite remarkable. My cycle navigator, apparently I made a knowledge graph and I didn't know it. So that's what my cycle navigator is and capturing the cycle, the curated content, the user intent and the AI solution. So all the craziness of working in the corporate world goes through this extension and can become amazing knowledge assets for teams because you've curated the data asset. 

You can share it by the way. The extension, you can share the selection of data you've selected and you can share all your cycles. so it's a seamless so this guy like I love this picture because this dude figured out the whole like fragmented chaotic workflow or maybe that's been his job for the past five years and now the new person coming in has to pay up and figure this all out. No, no, no, no, here, he's already picked them all up, and all you've got to do is just ask your question. So you're going to do this. 

Your Slack bot will be doing this in the back end. You'll have curated your knowledge base. You'll have made your delivery system. And then the users will just literally just ask the question. And then also, you can go back through the cycles and discuss and describe. Y 'all are too young to care about how to do work. 

Like, I've been working for as long as you. Anyway, okay. So, conclusion. 

I love this picture. 

Because actually, David Deutsch gave a TED Talk. The title of the TED Talk, in the TED Talk, he described this image, actually. And the title of the TED Talk was Pond Scum Who Dream of Distant Quasars. And in the TED Talk, he explained what is the most, dense piece of knowledge in the universe. So it might be a spaceship flowing through with like a database of all the knowledge that it's accumulated so far. I was like, that's an interesting thought. 

Well, look at that, oh my God, look at the AI produced, getting to the point. 

Anyway, so anyway, yeah, that's funny. Okay, so back to this, I paused it because we're in a graph and I'll go through it myself. It's much better than the AI's voice on the graph. Dimensions, this is just prompt engineering versus context engineering. The core functions, let's just go through on the left, the prompt engineer would be crafting specific instructions for a one -off response. They would be asking, how can I phrase this question perfectly? 

They would be focused on single input -output pair, the prompt, and then what the response comes back. It's a low scalability, it's very brittle, and it requires manual tweaking. The key skills are being having language creativity, yes, thinking to ask for a report or ask for get a KPI, you know, being creative a little bit, some intuition, some trial and error, primary tools or text editors, and AI chat interfaces, versus the context engineer, the science of architecture, you would be designing in the core function is designing a dynamic information ecosystem for consistent performance. Your mindset is what does the AI need to know this answer perfectly, you're already kind of in line with the context engineering. The scope, the entire context window, that's the scope. 

And the entire context window is every word from your first input, your first word in your input, to its last word of the output. That's all considered one context because every word that came before the last word goes into the calculation of the creation of that last word. See, so it's painting the whole picture from the first word to the last, so that's how you conceptualize one big page. That includes the memory, that's what you brought in from your PDF, the documents, any tools, so like if it can go do a Google search, if you've programmed that for it, no big deal. You can have AI help you make the tool. Give it a calculator. 

You can do that, because AI can't count. 

AI can't do math. 

But if you give it a calculator, just like a human, it can. History, like a chat history. And your instructions, that's sort of the scope of the work. Is it scalable? Fuck yes. Key skills, systems thinking. 

data architecture, information retrieval, and security. The tools are the vector databases, knowledge graphs, RAG frameworks, all the spicy juicy stuff, data curation platforms, all the fun stuff. Okay, any questions before I click the autoplay? This is, this is, we're getting through it, but this is worth coming slow. Cool, cool, cool. Dude, I just thought, dude, imagine I had a professor like this, dude. 

Imagine I had a professor and this was the lesson. That would be so fucking cool, bro. You just stop and ask, you know, questions or whatever to him and then fucking go back to this fucking, that'd be crazy. I don't know. Anyway, I don't know. Whatever. 

Ooh, yes. That's my, that's my special sauce. Oh, my guy graph, okay. 100X Curator, Intelligence Analyst. Those are just the three over. Probably just a repeat of what you just, yep, all the repeat. 

Fair, principles, blah, blah, blah. Red teaming, all the same stuff, okay. I really like this image. I really like this image a lot. The way that, because it, okay, so the AI might not get the right order of things always. Like, see how he's facing this way? 

He's facing like that way, and the, you know, and then the shield is on this side now, right? It's like, yeah, it's just part of the, and now it's like over here. So it's like. So it could just pass. So it's silly, silly, silly. But this is the one that's, you know, it's interesting, you know? 

That's why I run so many images because, yeah. and you're the first two DCIA students. Yeah, so hold on. I want to stop. OK, so my extension, I made this report before I had the idea about my extension, right? Sure, I had the idea to automate my process. 

Sure, yeah, it sounds like a painstaking, insurmountable task. But I did not have the idea to make a VS Code extension, right? So I did not have those two. And so that's literally on the fly tooling. Creating literally the tool to do the thing that I'm doing, it's crazy. It's like I use my own prompt to make the tool. 

It was so surreal to make this extension with AI, dude. It was surreal. Anyway, this is what I wanted to emphasize on. Because my wife, she's got the bug. She sees the light. And she is doing her data science degrees and stuff. 

And she literally did this before I even made the report. So even before this report was made, she made her own quiz generator. It's fantastic. In and of itself could be like a product. All you do is you give it like a PDF or like a list or like your chapter notes or your chapter text from your textbook, and it'll make 200 multiple -choice questions for you on that and those topics. And it'll, you know, give you immediate feedback on right or wrong answers, why it was right or why it's wrong. 

And she's been passing everything next class. Next semester she just takes and adds, she updated the app to be able to have a list. of quizzes. Now she can add a second data set and just select which one she wants to generate the questions for. And the questions are all generated on the fly so she can just generate a new, a whole new 200. So that's literally stage three right there. 

You know, it's pretty cool. Okay, so this one, yeah. Let's see. 

Stage one. 

So this is a matrix detailing roles. skills, activities, and the function of AI across the stages, okay? 

So on the cognitive annotator, the learner's role is to be a critical analyst of problems and solutions, core activities are decomposing problems. 

You're basically learning how to work with AI, honestly. You're building your own mental, every single prompt, you have to read it and understand it so that you know it, and then you can use it later as your tool, as your toolkit, because in the future, you'll remember what the AI could have answered, because you've actually seen and thought about and responded to that. prompt before. That's what you're doing at this stage. 

It just takes time. 

Going to the range. You've got to go to the range. Pattern recognition, logical decomposition, attention to detail, bias detection, critical thinking. These are what you're going to be developing. And then the AI is a scaffolded solution space. It's that you're on the ground, you're playing with your digital Legos, that it's produced for you, that you can combine and get them to work in your code project. 

And again, it doesn't have to be code. You could be writing a book. You could use my whole tool and toolkit and not write a single line of code. You could be writing a book and you need to artifact out all your characters and all the scenes and the locations and artifact it all out. Artifact out a timeline, how you want your set, your book to flow. 

And then you start building out chapter by chapter. 

the book will pretty much write itself when you've got all these artifacts created. Okay, adaptive tool maker, stage two, that's when you start making tools, like a little script here and there to make your process be easier. I've abstracted a lot of that away, but you will still find things that you will probably benefit, like for example, let's do this, this is a good example. Nope, yeah, that's fine, who cares. I need 1650 ELO, 2650 ELO on my game AI, so let me just level up my game AI a little bit. Let me get my ELO to 2366. 

This is my game. This is, I'm leveling up my game AI. It's predictive aiming, it's advanced combat logic to get more. Okay, there we go, I broke the threshold. Enter the circuit. So now this is my, presumably, you know, ostensibly my AI. 

Oh, we got a pop, we got a lag. Where does the lag come from? I'm trying to think. It's been fixed for the longest time, but it's back at the moment I'm showing it to you. But anyway, so in order to create this, which is every single movement is when it moves is, oh, that's the lag. Okay. 

Okay. We're back in. The lag is gone. Okay. I had to close some shit, but we're still wonky. Can you hear me? 

Okay. Let me stop and share. Oh, hold on. I have to disconnect my monitor. Yeah, the lag is gone now. This is what you get when you buy the cheapo laptop. 

It's a super powerful laptop, but I bought the cheapest one. It's got 64 gigs of RAM. It's got 16 gig video card on a laptop, but it's Asus, it's Asus, it's Ryzen, it's not Nvidia, right? But it's still, it's good. Minus these little imperfections. Oh, I can see, can you see it now? 

I can see it in my window of my, I wanna see if you can. I'll stop streaming. Yeah, stopping the stream just killed Discord. Okay, now we're back. And the lag is gone, right? And now they're moving. 

But okay, so here's the deal, here's the lesson. Here's the point of on -the -fly tooling. When I wanted to make this, I had a vision in my mind of what I wanted, and it was this, all right? Because what is this? OpenAI, before they made Chat GPT, this game I followed history. In 2016, The team who made ChatGPT made an AI called OpenAI5 and it could be and it 

the world champion of Dota in 2016. For the first time, a human team in Dota was beaten by an AI team. Big, big, big deal. Kind of a big deal, actually. And then in 2017, the Google research paper, Attention is All You Need, came out. And we all know what OpenAI pivoted to after that. 

So I wanted to follow history. The first AI you make in this game is an AI that can play Dota. That's what I wanted. So when I got to this point and I got the Dota map and I got the little UI, the battle viewer, and I had the little blue and red little user icons. And then when I tried to get the AI, okay, now make a move, right? And then all they would do is they would just fucking like jiggle. 

They would jiggle or they would all like, go to the top and just do that. And this is nothing. This is what I wanted. I wanted this. I knew what I wanted. But I also knew that in the back of my mind, what are the necessary data points to achieve this at a bare minimum? 

I deconstructed the problem. They are XY coordinates for each one of these over every second or movement step, right? so that's the and over this x y or the y x right that's that for each of the 10 okay that's the bare minimum that's the bare minimum so i that's what i would and i know the ai that i knew the ai could not generate that yeah that's not a generatable you see i'm saying it would be guard it wouldn't it would not there's no training do you know what i mean do you see how i'm how i'm deciding that's not the model's capabilities, right? In your question, like, can it do DNS? I don't think it can make JSON log replays. 

And let me show you what they look like, case in point. It's actually interesting. They look sort of like a tape deck, as it would, like as if you stretch out a tape from a cassette tape. Maybe that's before your time. Okay, yeah, so the tape, it looks like the tape of the tape deck, which is remarkable, because it's a tape. It is a replay. 

So, oh, and it makes sense because it's under similar, this is a learning lesson. It's simply, the remarkable part is not too remarkable once you realize it's just because the two are under similar constraints. They're both a replay. Oh, so it makes sense, they sort of look alike. Okay, so if I just do a search for, supposed to be a, there we go. Trying to find a quick way to get to the replays. 

How do I, Jason, how do I, oh, can I do that? Yes, there we go, there we go. Okay, here's one of the replays. Here's one of the, I made, I ended up making 52 different replays. So I did this over a weekend, but we'll get to that. So I'm showing you the end product and then I'll tell you how I got to this. 

So this is what these replays look like. They're just long strings of time minus 89, like the Dota game, you have 90 seconds to start. And then slot 0 through slot 9, those are the 9 players. That's the one team, team A and team B. And then these are their XY coordinates. And then I also just, at that point, I went ahead and grabbed the kills and the net worth as just two additional data points to play with those data points. But I'm sure y 'all have played Dota or League of Legends or that, you know all the creeps and all that. 

There's so many data points. There's so, every creep movement, every creep attack, what its health was is, when it died, all those data points is in those logs, the replays that you can download. You can download those replays. And those are the replays that OpenAI trained their game bot on to even beat the players, right? And so that's what I did. 

I went and I downloaded all those, a bunch of replays from, you know, whatever it is, Dota Live Replay API, whatever it is, OpenDota API, OpenDota . 

com. where all the games that go on do get saved and put in here and you can go through and download and watch the replay in a very sophisticated system or I just made my own system replayer. See? And so that's what I did. But there are 200 megabyte files each replay. They're huge. 

They're big. And so I had to parse them down. I had to extract only, first I had to even find the data points in them. They're gobs of data. Where's the few data points I need? So that's this control F searching. 

I had the idea, aha, I need the X, Y, so maybe it's an X. I just did a control F for X. And then I put, it's a lot, so I put an X with a quotation mark and I found it, the X and the Ys. And I analyzed the lines and I realized how I could get to them. And I started using, I started making a script. to help me parse it, and then once I've made a script and a workflow to this 200 file down to two megabytes with just the data points that I needed for my replays, I then just repeated that 51 more times. I picked a bunch of different games and I labeled the games, whether or not the player wins or loses, whether they lost badly. 

And you can see the score, they got spanked, nine to 28, 10 to 44, or they lost big. So it's not so big of a loss spread. The loss spread is less or whatever the game was closer. close game and then whether or not it was a normal length game, a long game, it went long or it went short, or it was epic like it was over an hour long. And then so now with that, with the game now, depending on my ELO score and the threshold and the difference, I can then have my, I can now have an algorithm pick which replay it should play for the player based off the ELOs. And that's what you just watched. 

And apparently I just lost. 

Oh, I lost, but I did get, I did get replay data. 

Ah, this is annoying. 

Okay. Okay, we're back. We're back, baby. Okay. I did get replay data. So what does that mean? 

That means I can retrain my game AI agent. So I'm going to start. See, I got all the data I can accumulate. Tier four data. Start training. Ooh, I started a training run. 

I got a training loss curve. 

I'm training the game AI agent in my cluster A over here. 

Almost done. Okay. Trained. Now I can benchmark it. So I'll run an eval. Oh. 

That was quick. Actually, it's supposed to be a lot longer than that, but that's okay. 

We don't question it. 

What's going to happen over here? Oh, it just went up. The data quality score and the Elo ranking just went up. Now my game AI is a bit... because I trained it more. See? 

I simulated fucking... Yeah, I fucking simulated it all, dude. Okay, so... And then you can train LLM. You can't talk to it. I think I showed this to you in there. 

I'll show it to your roomie real quick. But there is just... And so I've got it. It will change the response, the quality of this response and the content. based off the level of my AI that I have in the game. So right now, it's got no features. 

It's a very basic LLM, so how does it respond when I say test? Test, okay, you said test, I said test. Test is good. You want to test more? I can say test. Tell me, tell, tell me a joke. 

Tell me a joke. Okay, here's a joke. Why did the chicken cross the road to get to the other side? Hehe, that's a good joke. You like? No, like a good joke. 

But it's a real AI, dude. You make your own little AI. And I even had an idea. Imagine you could make a URL for your players, where they could link to it. Because this is all live. Everything you're watching, reading, it's all on you. 

It could go to this website. But I could make a URL that you could share with someone else after you made an AI in here and trained it. And then it would be your AI, literally. You could share a chat interface. That'd be cool. OK, joke time. 

Why didn't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything. Aha, good joke, yes. OK, cool, cool, cool. So anyway. Yep, so that's that, that's that. 

Let's get back to here. And then we'll go in through these, Cursive Learner, Adaptive Toolmaker, On the Fly, Systems Thinking, Adaptive, you start using the AIs of that tool. component library. It's like, hey, do you know about this library or what library can we use to solve this problem? Yeah, I remember all that stuff. It gives you functions and snippets for the learner to assemble into their project. 

Then you become a recursive learner. That's an example of me. Once I got the bug of these images and I realized, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can do text and it's not gibberish, I figured out the trick. The trick is you just put it in quotations. You tell, okay, first the trick is you understand the system you're working with, which is there's a diffusion model that is smaller and like an autistic savant that knows how, where every rivet on the battleship should be, but it doesn't know that ships go in the ocean. It'll put it on the land. 

So like that, so like that, you know. And then there's the actual AI that you're talking with, like gemini . google . com, when you say make me a picture of a cat. Well, that Gemini will then make a tool call to the diffusion model with your request. And it's depending on how that Gemini wrote to the diffusion model is the image is going to come back. 

Did it put quotes? Did it put the words it wants the diffusion model to produce in quotes or not? Did you tell it to? Because they didn't fucking train it to. Maybe they have now, I don't know. But when I made all these, they didn't. 

That's what all the gibberish came from. But I figured it out. I figured it out by making hundreds of images. Wait a minute, why does this one have words? This one did not. Wait a minute, why are these spelled correctly? 

This thing can spell Kibana? Do you remember the training? That training with the one that it says Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash? That image was the first image I ever got in AI to produce. words spelled correctly. And it was Elasticsearch, Bogstash, and Kibana. 

And I was like, wow. And then now we're here. now. This is a nice. So I made 2 ,000 images That's the stage 3 recursive learner an engineer of one's own expertise Manda cognitive analysis of personal learning gaps building personalized learning accelerators Me making this making 2 ,000 images not because I needed 2 ,000. I could just make one for each page I wanted to I wanted to get perfection in these images the The key skills developed is advanced metacognition, recursive thinking, expertise modeling, self -regulated learning. 

The AI serves as a meta -tool used to construct personalized tools that enhance learners' cognitive capabilities. What I was using it for is I would have it, you know, so for example, Solarpunk, which you see in front of you, is the Solarpunk dichotomy to Cyberpunk. See, I never knew the term Solarpunk. Maybe you're just learning it. You probably knew Cyberpunk. We all know Cyberpunk. 

But I didn't know solarpunk. 

All I had to do is know that term that AI brought it to me throughout this process. I then learned solarpunk. I'm like, oh, well, that's easy. That makes sense. That's the term. So now I have an image system prompt. 

I have an artifact that describes how we're making a report and how pick through the motif, the theme of anywhere between like early cyberpunk without cyber cybernetics augmentations modifications that kind of stuff and solar pump is the hopeful visual for the future and anywhere in between that that that sort of scale that's my instruction to the AI now and that's how we get thematic and then I eventually made a section in my system prompt that really articulated and I had the AI help me write that part of the system prompt, because it sees the system prompt. It can update its own system prompt with my articulation. And it made a section to spell out how to make, because it's one thing to have this with colors and things, versus just like white. See? Like white, right? 

So then I started to get more consistency. I wanted to try to get more consistency in the titles so then I started making a section in my system prompt that contains like that grayish sort of that look sort of try to capture that sort of white gray kind of thing going on as you can see sort of it kind of this was before I sort of thematic -ing it out and this is after this gray and white it's gray and white see so yeah and I never and I didn't and I see gray and white and I have not gone back through and sort of standardized everything I don't need to. I'm on a newer project, right? You know, so okay, so we're getting ahead. Hold up, hold up. I skipped the UBA. 

That's where you wanted to know. We're almost there now. We're almost there to the UBA. Okay, so three slides away. Okay, so I think that's all. So let's finish this one. 

The DCIA, the step four. The learner's role is to be a master, practitioner, and mentor. The core activities are fluid, intuitive, Human AI collaboration. That is what it feels like. On -the -fly tooling. That is what I make. 

Designing complex systems. I'm going to make up my own PCTE, guys. That's the first project that I'm going to make with my own tool. I already have a plan. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm going to do it. So, key cognitive skills developed, true intuition, strategic foresight, effortless execution. 

The AI's role is to be a cognitive exoskeleton that augments the expert's intent, speed, and reach. 

It really does not read well. 

Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so that's sort of so this is kind of my idea The way it would work. We'll get to how it works But yeah, well and this is a good example This is also a good example of why to run multiple products because when I did this one I did four different research proposals on UBA and have it go try to find stuff and one of them was like Uh, start starting to like, um, Oh, AI credit. 

No, not UBA. 

It was on AI credits. Let me tell the story when we get to AI credits. Okay. So, uh, yeah. Um, yeah. So which may be next or soon. 

There was a moment where I was riding in my cycles and I was, and I was like, wait a minute. I literally wrote, wait a minute. I'm like, wouldn't the value of these AI credits go up over time? Like no matter what, like, because if you have a thousand credits today and you don't use them, you wait five years. You have thousand credits five years from now and now you got Gemini like 17. Those are thousand credits. 

are gonna make you a fucking, fucking, you wouldn't download a car. 

Fucking maybe you will with Gemini 7, maybe it's got a 3D printer, you can connect it to your fucking 3D printer, you know what I'm saying? 

Like, you know what I'm saying? So like, so those 1 ,000 credits are gonna go a lot farther because the same, you know, the AI today can maybe just source your email, but then the AI next year can maybe make you a web application, okay? And so, yeah, I've had this thought, I was like, wait a minute. So I'm like, wait a minute. Yeah. And so part of it is the AI, but a lot of it is the driver as well. 

I have to come up with these ideas and bring them, but I'm doing all this reading of this research, where do you think the ideas are coming from? Because I'm reading this good research that this AI is bringing to me. It's Bitcoin. I call it Bitcoin without the stress. And so here's a little graph. This part is a little wonky on the graph. 

This part makes this part larger. Sorry about that. But once you get over that, you can actually see what this is trying to say. You know, the first year, you can give someone 100 credits or $100. On the second year, that $100 is worth $97 because of inflation. But that credit, just one year later, is worth 167 credits, the equivalent. 

based off this math of Wright's Law and the drop in performance and the price of AI over time that we have measured so far. 

And so extrapolate that out 10 years, those 100 credits are worth 6 ,000 credits, while the $100 is now worth $73. 

We need to start this yesterday. 

So, okay, how can we start this? 

Kinda, now it's minutia. 

Let's see, let's skip. 

Yeah, now minutiae. 

Well, that's more minutiae. 

Ha ha ha 

Yeah, so you made it to the end almost no one literally y 'all are literally Literally, I think the only people now we have skipped a bit as I was going through I saw the Chinese China part. 

We actually did skip some of the real juice here, especially We did we skipped this we skipped intelligent eyes warfare we skipped we skipped the open -source drug and horse We skipped we skip this stuff, but I remembered that as it was talking I was like, ah, we didn't we didn't we clearly skip some of this stuff because we didn't capture that but that's okay. That's okay So so now that you've gotten the notion like any any idea any thoughts questions? What do you guys think of this? I mean dude, like what I do it everyone should be seeing this website dude, like everyone needs to learn this Yeah Cool. All right, so then let's do this. 

I will share the extension with you guys, and then I will start the project. Or hey, we've been going for hours, so let me know how y 'all, but that will be the next step. Whenever you're, dude, I am ready. At the moment, we're done here. All I'm gonna do is keep cooking. I'm gonna just make that thing I was talking to you about. 

It's actually gonna be pretty fucking cool, this thing. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. 

Okay, I was going to ask for a break or anything, but just showing you. 

Um, yes, I'm getting hungry too. The wife is hungry. Yep. Yep. 

Any day later on this afternoon. 

Tomorrow's fine. Yeah. 

Anything, dude. 

Again, like I said, I'm just on this because again, you saw the path, you know that I'm on that scale. I'm going up. 

I'm at a hundred. I'm going for a thousand next dude. Uh, okay. So, um, if you want to join, like you got to get started to, um, just showing you, I'd see I'm starting my next project. So I will. Do that do this in front of you, but with your idea and then you will just do it with me That's part of the scaffolding process That's the step one through four and I'm just saying it to you now so that you kind of get a picture of when we do get there You'll know what to do. 

But for now, I'll go ahead and get this file out to you both the current version of it I will demons you won't be using it, but I'll just demonstrate one tiny aspect of it Not on this window because I haven't started it over on this window over on this window. I have started it so it should be um yeah in my cycles so see this see this right here see it's all gone luckily luckily i have that this working um save and load stuff so well i thought i had it working so at least i got uh part of it oh hold on wait so okay i'm working on that so it's a process um i have it um in here i have to reconstruct it now see So I guess I'm gonna work on this, right? Actually, I'm kind of working on that right now. So this was a good test to see when it failed when I restarted this thing, to see that it failed. So now I can construct it to it and work on that. 

I've been waiting to, that's another thing you'll learn is I'll wait to observe a failure more so I can describe it more to the AI. Because if you actually are describing the error incorrectly, You actually get your you can really get yourself up shits creep because it starts making a lot of changes to your files On something that's not even really honestly and then you later realize all the problems over here. Fuck You know those so so i'm taking my time, but it was good for me. Anyway, yeah So, uh, what when when do you think is good for you guys? Um, okay. Sure. 

Uh, cool Um, then you don't need my extension if you want to start curating like anything you think you might need for jqrs You can just make a folder and start dropping shit in the folder And then when we get together, yep, no problem. Understood. No problem. Understood. I got you. Yep. 

So you know. Yeah. Yep. So then there you go. So then, yeah, that'll be the plan. And then we'll just, I'll get, we can start the Slack bot. 

Cause you don't need that. Cause again, that was the last piece of my Slack bot, right? I got everything up and working before that. And then I said, okay, now let's do the PDF thing. So you can do all of that. And then when, when it's ready, you, you can do that with test PDFs. 

The guy in the video was using the U S constitution. So he could ask questions on the U S constitution. You know, you can test it for anything. And then when you're ready, you just go get your, we'll make it. We'll make the, we'll make your knowledge base. Cool. 

Okay. Thanks for taking the attention. I think everyone needs to know. And the more people we can get on board over time, the better it starts with showing them the product. So yeah, you're on the right track. Cool. 

Cool. Well, nice to meet your friend, your roommate. See you guys. Perfect. Yep. I'll look for it. 

You too. Bye.
