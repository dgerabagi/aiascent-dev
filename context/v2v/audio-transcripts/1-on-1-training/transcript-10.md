that anything was done to this after the image was taken. The first time he mentioned it to me, he said, I've got this photograph. I wonder if you could copy it for me. I'm going up to Scotland to get it. Fitted with the story, it substantiates the narrative that's been told about it. The grain seems very smooth over the edges of the object. There's no sign that anything was done to this after the image was taken. 

At the RVF, saved this for 30 plus years. 

Yes. 

Even after retirement, he took it with him when he left the office in 2000. He's kind of a hero. 

He is a real hero. 

We would know so less about this story now if it wasn't for Craig doing what he did. 

This was a good photo. It was twofold, really. Firstly, it was daylight. But secondly, far more importantly, there were features of the ground. And what that meant, of course, is that one can triangulate, one can start to make detailed calculations about the distance of the object from the camera, the height above the ground, et cetera. Everyone was very impressed with this and said, no, it's a solid, structured, real craft. 

Where's the fuselage? Where are the engines? How does this thing fly? And what we were interested in trying to do from the images is to try and almost reverse engineer an idea about what kind of propulsion system was involved here. And that, we hoped, would give us a clue as to who was operating this. 

The last thing we wanted was an open discussion about these up -close and personal daylight images. of a huge unknown craft of some type with military aircraft in the background. Each and at a time when a military aircraft was seen, you would find out in an instant what aircraft it was, what squadron it came from, instantly be able to brief them. Whatever reason, the Ministry of Defense line on this is that craft was not traced, were not interviewed. 

The overwhelming consensus is that the military plane seen in the photo is a Harrier jump jet, but neither records nor a pilot's name has been found. 

So we've got three possible scenarios. One, hoax. Two, secret stealth military aircraft belonging to the United States or some other foreign power. Or three, which would fall into the category of other, which would imply originating from a non -human intelligence. 

during my posting on the UFO desk. I went to a briefing, a more general briefing about UAP, and this photo was brought out, and the briefer, who was in the intelligence community, said, this photo here, he said, and he started gesticulating, and he said, you know, it's not the United States. He said, it's not Russia. He pointed straight up. We looked at his finger, and we looked at the ceiling, and nothing further was said. 

Thirty -four years after their disappearance, A co -worker at the hotel, Richard Greave, has broken his silence. A few days after taking the photos, the witnesses and their co -workers were on a five -minute cigarette break when they had an unexpected visit. The lights stayed on, the window wiper stayed on, private glass in the back, driver in the front. He never got out of his car once, but the two people in the back did. So that was it. cigarette breaks over, go back inside, we need to speak to your friends. 

Richard and the other chefs watched through a nearby hotel window as the two strangers confronted their co -workers in the parking lot. Spooks, they were men in black, and they stood outside in the pissing rain, speaking for roughly 10 minutes. The men drove off, two witnesses came back inside. 

Came in the back door, ghost. Something happened, something, out the car. I heard the absolute crap out of them. Picture a UFO and the Americans are after us. The same chefs that left the same kitchen I was working in with them. 

According to their co -worker, Richard, two witnesses started to drink heavily, missed shifts, slept in their cars at work, and after four weeks, they vanished without a trace. 

Chefs don't just disappear out of the kitchen for 34 years and not have no other job. Do you hear what I'm saying? Just don't fuck off and not work ever again. Where are they? 

Washington, D . C. , filmmakers arrive at NASA headquarters for a press conference where the head of NASA will announce the results of their first year -long UAP study. 

The announcement was made during a news conference on findings from NASA's headquarters in Washington, D . 

C. 

We, NASA, have taken for the first time concrete action to seriously look into UAP. 

UAP are one of our planet's greatest mysteries. 

We looked at NASA's assets. 

They typically do not have the resolution needed for UAP events. 

They relied on unclassified data only. 

The NASA independent study team, based on our current findings and methodology, that we find no evidence to suggest that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin. Most events are explainable as planes, balloons, drones, satellites, aircraft, seeing the sun glinting off of them. 

weather phenomenon and instrument features. 

We don't know what these UAP are, but we're going to try to find out. You said at the beginning of the meeting that NASA will be transparent. Well, a month and a half ago, Mr. David Grush said under oath in Congress that the U . S. government is in possession of UAPs and extraterrestrial life. Do you believe what Mr. David Grush said or is he lying? 

if I recall having seen this on the nightly news, was that he had a friend that knew where a warehouse was that had FOs. 

locked up in a warehouse. 

I served at the NRO operations center on the director's briefing staff, which included the coordination of the presidential daily brief in supporting a variety of contingency operations, which I was the reserve intelligence division chief backup. 

For the first time in history, an intelligence officer with top level security clearances testified under oath. that the U . S. 

government has definitive proof that we're not alone. 

Mr. Rush? Chairman, Ranking Members, and Congressmen, my name is David Charles Rush. 

I was an intelligence officer for 14 years, both in the U . 

S. 

Mr. Rush, a decorated combat veteran, had been tasked by multiple agencies to look specifically into classified UAP evidence. 

I was my agency's co -lead in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and Transmedium Object Analysis, as well as reporting to the UAP Task Force. 

The Inspector General deemed his whistleblower claim both credible and urgent. 

Mr. Grush, in the last couple of years, have you had incidences that have caused you to be in fear for your life for addressing these issues? 

Yes, personally. Upon discovering a rogue UAP program, Mr. Brush felt going public was his only option. 

To put in perspective, if they were really not scared about this information coming out, why would someone be intimidated like that? 

Has the U . 

S. 

government become aware of actual evidence of extraterrestrial, otherwise unexplained forms of intelligence? 

I was informed in the course of my official duties of a multi -decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program. I made the decision, based on the data I collected, to report this information to my superior superiors and multiple inspectors general, and in effect becoming a whistleblower. 

What level of security clearance is required to fully access these programs? 

You know, TSSCI clearance and meets the eligibility criteria. The access adjudicative authority should be able to grant you access. Mr. Burchard, if you'll yield. 

So, just to be put a fine point on that. 

He knows all this information, but by law he can't tell it to us unless we're in a secure environment. 

It's something I can't discuss in a public setting. 

Mr. Grish, finally, do you believe that our government is in possession of UAPs? 

Absolutely, based on interviewing over 40 witnesses over four years. And where? I know the exact locations, and those locations were provided to the Inspector General, and some of which to the intelligence committees. 

I actually had the people with the first -hand knowledge provide a protected disclosure to the Inspector General. 

A former staff member for the Senate Armed Services Committee was present at meetings with current and former government and contractor personnel claiming first -hand knowledge of involvement in crash recovery operations, intelligence operations, and reverse engineering programs. 

They have or have had very high -level security clearances. They appear to be rational and believable. 

You're telling me People have come forward behind the scenes. 

claiming first -hand knowledge of non -human origins. 

That's correct, they have. We have, let's say sources, we have individuals, people, who have asserted not only that there have been crashes, but there have been crash retrievals, and that there is a crash retrieval effort that has spanned a significant period of time since the end of the Second World War. 

And so it does deserve to be looked at seriously, not dismissed. 

I just kept trying to keep an open mind. And I really believe it's all about the data. I'm very empirical. And I'm not going to, say, take a conclusive position on this until there is absolute conclusive proof. But at this point, together with some other sources, I started to think, oh my god, it's really true. 2020. 

Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Christopher Mellon engaged in confidential correspondence with a high -level government official with credible access, who described in considerable detail aspects of an alleged UAP recovery program. After he cleared it for release, Mellon provided an unredacted copy with names, including that of the gatekeeper of the program to select members of Congress. I was flabbergasted when I got this message. This is from somebody that I knew, a senior government official with appropriate access telling me that UAP have landed and been recovered and there is a formal government program and he had encountered it, discovered it, and was seeking to be read into it. And I are making huge progress getting into the crash retrieval program. 

So it's not just one individual, it's two who are involved in winning. He plans to meet with you at some point. The Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees would be 

It's not you, it's me, so the hell am I doing? 

is on display including you and i feel every day it's just the same stuck in the loop i need some variety i'm sick of this anxiety i'm sick of this society they make us feel alone we compare ourselves to others but we all got different mothers we were raised in different structures so we're different there's no one to judge with afflictions. I look at what's in front of us on the other things. I know that's something that could challenge me. For my classes, push through all the constants. Plus, I'm ambitious and I'm restless, yeah. 

Was an apprentice, but possessed a different engine. So I asked a lot of questions, and I learned a lot of things, and I worked on my direction, yeah. We don't hide or die. Through the rise of enchantment. We don't strive to make progress. We don't hide from the pride when we train. 

We don't rise of enchantment. We don't hide or die. Through the rise of enchantment. 

if they found out what we now know. Dealing with the recovered UAP crashed and did in Kingman Arizona 50s. Also know who recovers landed or crashed UAPs under what authorities. We know the management structure and the security control systems and ownership of the program. We know a still highly classified memo by the Secretary of the Air Force in the 50s is still in effect to maintain the cover. 

We also know who the Air Force gatekeeper is, and he names him. The gatekeeper is the individual who manages access to the program. And I know someone who spoke to the Air Force gatekeeper, and, um, The Air Force gatekeeper purportedly neither confirmed nor denied. Air Force Master Sergeant Jason Sands has secretly testified to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees. This is his first time going on camera to discuss the unclassified portion of those meetings. Could you and a handful of others prove to our government, our elected officials, that we are in possession of off -world vehicles? 

Yes. 

Master Sergeant Sands is willing to publicly testify under oath to Congress that he can produce the classified details needed to verify the following claims, provided he's given immunity. 

I'm a retired Air Force Master Sergeant. Part of my career in the 1990s, I worked three years at the Air... and the programs which included numerous sites around the United States and I was one of the red team members that would go out and do telecommunications assessments to check for intelligence leaks and counterintel type issues at those locations that were involved in the legacy program. 

The term legacy program means endeavors to collect, exploit, or revive -engineer technologies of unknown origin, or examine biological evidence of living or deceased non -human intelligence. 

Do you have the names of the programs? 

I gave it all to them. 

You have the names of the people involved with the programs? 

Yes. 

This definition appears verbatim in the UAP Disclosure Act authorized by Senators Schumer, Rounds, Rubio, and Gillibrand that passed the Senate in 2023. 

Why now? I feel like it is the time where I've seen the interest in the Congress. I've seen the interest with the UFO programs, and including Aero, the talk of that, standing up and everything. I kind of think in my head, is this the time to do this? Because I'd seen so many times that it failed. Decade after decade of, you know, somebody trying to come forward, pointing fingers at Congress, pointing fingers at everybody, pointing fingers at whoever else, and it just was very adversarial. 

I felt comfortable enough without getting shot to go walk on air and show them exactly what I told them in the interview. I would go out there and I would drive them right up to the gate. As long as I knew they had the authority to walk into that facility with me. This is the hangar I told you about. There's the radar over there. There's the weather station I was taken over. 

Here's where me and the commander went around the whole base. Show them all those kinds of things. And that's where we're kind of headed with all this. Get the fact that the technology, if you could separate that out, call that national security, that the technologies they're working on, that has some reason to stay classified. But the revelation that there's other life out there. that should be something for everybody. 

That's the way I feel. Staffers have confirmed the credentials of this witness to the filmmakers. He is who he says he is. 

He was stationed where he said he was, and he's confirmed actual names of classified programs. It's a concern that there's something locked up, classified, and that is not being opened. or is he lying? 

Whatever he said, where's the evidence, is my response. 

I can give you a specific cooperative and hostile witness list. 

And we could get that in the SCIF if we were allowed to get in a SCIF with you, would that be probably? 

I can't discuss that publicly, but I did provide that information both to the intel committees and the Inspector General. 

He also said he had another friend that said that he had parts Do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft? 

As I've stated publicly already in my News Nation interview, biologics came with some of these recoveries, yeah. 

Do you believe our government has made contact with intelligent extraterrestrials? 

Something I can't discuss in a public setting. at Nellis Test Range in Nevada in the winter of 1994. U . 

S. Air Force Master Sergeant Jason Sands was stationed at the nearby Nellis Air Base with the 67th Intelligence Group at the time. This previous week, the UFO came on the range, flew right by what we called the schoolhouse, because that's where we did the training, and it went down into the valley, continued on. So they have actual video of it, and that's what you see out there in the public, this Nellis Range UFO. The system that they use also uses a type of radar to lock on to aircraft as they come into view. So this is what recorded the UFO also. 

The public also leaked the names of those individuals. A lot of them were excited. Some didn't know what it was. Some were saying it was a UFO for sure. Other people were like, no, it had to be some kind of messed up looking helicopter. 

Other people were like, I just don't know. 

I just don't know. But everybody was excited about it. 

Days later, Sergeant Sands was part of a convoy overseeing a training exercise. He was in the lead vehicle heading toward the center of Nellis Range near Quartz Mountain. Cuts right through whatever you're wearing. First in the passenger seat and a young lady off to my right. There's this guy on my left, looks like he's wearing a uniform like ours. But I also notice his skin tone is very white to blue. 

Running funny too, it's like every step he takes, it looks like he's gonna fall over. Needs help, we need to stop. He must be suffering from hypothermia because he does have this bluish tint to his skin. 

I'm thinking, this guy needs medical help, I need to get my butt out of the car and you know, before he falls down and starts to die. 

And I'm thinking... 

In the distance, Sergeant Sands noticed a strange landed craft, resembling a helicopter, but he was more focused on the individual in need of help. 

And then as we slow down and we approach the part where he's only just a few feet away... Is it serious? It's always serious when credentials are compromised. That's how they get in. 

Now excuse me, I've got to shut the door. 

Make sure your form is perfect when doing weighted sit -ups to build your core strength. There's one more thing where data is money. 

Thank you. Thank you. 

Bye. you idiots.
