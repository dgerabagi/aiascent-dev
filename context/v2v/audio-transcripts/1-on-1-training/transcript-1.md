It's fine. It's fine. 

We'll do it live. 

Don't worry, don't worry. 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

We're going to do it live. 

You're going to do it live. Okay. Um, so then that's, but that is, that's why I realized I should have recorded it because that's essentially the end of lesson one. Now that I think of it is you've got the knowledge to put together your documentation file. You don't need to, you don't need to do any cleaning right now. That's not, that's not part of lesson one. 

I showed you so you know what's coming, so you know what to get accumulated. You know what you need to make your static content. The struggle is making it. So if you can accumulate now, if you can make your own SCC repo, both of you, make your own, make your own prompt file. I'll just share this exact starting point. And I'll even share, I'll try to, I'll dig into my, see this, I'll dig into my, I do have, I do, I save all my prompts. 

I just, I don't, I don't organize them because, I just save them and then I get them when I need them. Prompt to upscale in -game content. This is the one. 65 cycles, bro. 

Y 'all, it's not going to take y 'all 65. 

Yeah, yeah. But this is gold, though. This is gold. You're going to have this. This is going to be like your lab guide, because any freaking problem you're encountering, you probably are going to encounter, you know... Anyway, anyway, you can... 

This would be exactly, you know... This is, see, now I need, now we're doing in -game two. Here's the section titles. Look at how much of work it is with Cycle 60 for me, right? Because I've got all the context. I've got all the context already. 

And look, I'm making progress. Nice, all right, perfect. Now let's do this. Oh, I realized something. We need to, you know, we got the cores wrong, right? You got something. 

I was doing some images or something. Oh, I was making images at this point. See? Okay. So yeah. Okay. 

So I'll, that'll be my piece together lesson or resources. Mainly two, mainly two. The prompt I used for in -game and the prompt the final version of the prompt so it'll have all the cycles in it All you'll care about are the cycles. You won't really care about What the current files state is at because that's kind of the living document part. That's always changing That was the current files. I needed at cycle 65. 

Maybe it has nothing to do with the rest because I was making freaking images, right? Um, so but what you care about are the the knowledge will be within the cycles. So i'll accumulate that Um, you can even use it to help you come up with your own cycle zero prompts. I have a cycle zero in, you'll have to use a version. Each one will have a cycle zero in it as well. But you see, project scope. 

You see, interaction schema. You see, I've already got an interaction schema with seven different steps. You can take this. Internal versus learner facing dialogue. Maintain a strict separation between internal development or cycles. And, oh, and you know what? 

I had to write this for stupider AI. Smarter AI's don't need as much of this kind of steering. Okay. But so, and the way you will, you won't make an interaction schema initially, it should come naturally. And simply for that reason, I just explained, um, the AI you're using now is, is a smarter AI than the one I was using. then. 

This wouldn't hurt to have, but if the AI, what you would be not knowing is can the AI do it without this extra guidance or not? Because then at that point, this becomes extra baggage. The AI only has X amount of time to process your query. And so if you're throwing in extra baggage to it, it's going to spend time on that extra baggage versus a cleaner prompt. So, but it's, It's better to have it and not need it. So that will be what I do. 

You will get these two files. You can add them in to your repo as a document that you can then just click and review anytime. See, that's part of the lesson is recognizing that that should go in the documents. One of the first things I think we'll do, one of the first prompts is to start making some artifacts, which would be to try to Separate you thinking about which sections of this document you're gonna want to iterate on because you can start to separate this large document out into Smaller artifacts so that you can iterate on each and any one the AI will give you back the exact artifact in in These because that's how you deal with it It will deal with you and then you can copy and then you can diff whatever it gives you Oh, the only difference in the JSON was this. Easy peasy. We'll be doing the exact same diffing. 

And that's how you'll get 

that's how you'll rise above the wheat from the chaff. 

Because any old person using AI is taking the first response, aren't they? 

But we will have a methodical process where we will have this environment that allows us to pick the best responses and start from there. 

Okay? Yep. Okay. So any questions? No. put together a repo, and then that's it. 

I'll get you those resources. 

Once you feel like you have a repo, we will make a script that makes your flattened repo. 

And then we can do our first prompt. And I'm not joking, take your time. It took me three days to put together the beacon, okay? Yes. Sorry? Oh, this one already? 

Yeah, absolutely. You can't have the AI make a lesson unless it knows how we style it. 

our content. 

That would be an inclusion in the repo. See, I can go through my list, and that would help you add to your list. Yeah, I was going to say, you probably have, because I just had that copied over to Claude, basically, in a text document. But if you already have that stuff, that's definitely, obviously, a style guide is going to be one of them. Yep. Okay, go back up though. 

I'm saving this under, where did you put it? You said I just got to make the documents, right? So I put all the documents in there? Yep, you can start in just one folder. That's why we started with just two folders. With things you're adding, throw them in documents. 

Once you've got 10 things, then you'll think of how they should be organized. And we'll make it so you can change it on the fly when you realize it's more. And it's simple because you'll have checkboxes. So you'll be like, well, I don't want to have to check five files if I put them in one folder because they're related now. I realize they're related. You'll organize it naturally. 

I can't tell you. You have to do it. What do you generally put under artifacts? Don't worry. You won't be putting anything. The AI will create them for you. 

Let me show you... What an example would be like an artifact? I can show you what that would look like. Yes. I can absolutely show you that. Okay. 

So say you're... 

Exactly. 

Okay. Man. So I might have a folder of ELOs or would that be under documentation? 

So, okay. 

This IOC track... Open. Let me see. Hold on. Give me a second. Here we go. 

No. Artifacts list. So the instructor guide template is one artifact. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. In our new definition, excuse me. Those are the outputs of the AI. 

Things you ask of it. Oh, it puts it out in artifacts? Yeah. And so they look the same as a document within our one file, because they're both going to be programmatically handled. But I'll just write it out. So like it would literally be this. 

Artifact one is section B from training because that is the particular section that you're focusing on on this first cycle, let's just say. And so you're asking the AI to upscale that section and then it'll actually give it back to you. It'll actually give you the way we'll program it. It'll give you a description of what the artifact is. We'll have it, we'll give it some tags. It will just do this automatically. 

It'll tag our artifacts. Tags, go here. And then literally, it could be just a few paragraphs. It could be your code that you needed it to write for you. But what it is, is it's all the content in here that then you literally copy once, from the response, because, you know, we copy and paste, yeah. And then you literally make a new file, name it what it calls it, section B. from training dot markdown or json or whatever and then drop it in because the program will 

let me go back a bit, if I just alt -tab, yep, okay, the program will write this in. When you flatten it, that's what the script does, see? And the script will count the size of this thing, and when it does, when it makes this file. See, this is all the flattened artifacts. 

Artifacts are just the same as documents, the only difference is they're the ones you're iterating on, they're things that you need to work with the AI to produce. 

And so if you just think of them as some things that you don't change, it's very helpful because there's an urge to make changes yourself. And it's better for you in the long run if you learn to everything, learn how to ask the AI to do it, because do that for a year, and then the way you ask it is different. So yeah, that's what an artifact is. It'll be something - Going back to the repo then, because I'm trying to think, and let me just think out loud, and then you can just help me think of what folders in the repo I would need to eat. Again, don't, oh, one more thing. Don't stress too much about organization now, beyond the doc. 

I'm not worried. Yeah, I'm just trying to get what information. So I'm still trying to connect the dots together, right? So little things in here and there are starting to connect. But yeah, because you said, hey, I need you to get what you need in your repo. So I'm trying to figure out. 

So I need all my documentation that's going to be for that lesson, right? So I need a documents repo. In the documents repo though, I want to keep enabling learning objectives and the actual framework it gets tied to separate. So do I have one that's like enabling learning objectives, right? So like when I go into prompt, I can say, hey, these are all the enabling learning objectives are, you know, here located here, like, or do you keep that under your documents? Once they're in, you can, you can make them artifacts as well. 

and the term make quote making something an artifact is just giving it like an a number and then you refer to it as that and you can put two things in one artifact it's very unstructured um then you just say you know refer to artifact three you can so ah so like this so i started to i tried to group so i did find metadata was a valuable grouping because i would do like artifact Section three is the metadata. So so this isn't so let's can we use a real can we just go back to? The second link I sent you with a third The which one was it? I'll go to the last link. I sent you. Okay. 

Was it the last one? Yeah, so I have like for example, like the ELOs are right there, right? This is what I have to build the training off of those, right? You can see I'm six one one six one two all that right and So how would you structure that data? Like I wouldn't beyond this, this would be one artifact and you could then hold. That's right. 

And then whatever you want to work on, on that artifact, you say the ELOs in artifact three, and then that's what it's going to work on to upgrade. And then you would, you would bring, you would want your metadata that it, the AI is going to be referencing in order to upscale it. That's going to be included in your cycle files list, right? You're going to make sure that. Yeah, I guess that's the part I'm having like. OK, so you converted this to a. 

PDF or Word document. That's right. You fed it to it, right? I'm just dropping it in here. It will, we'll have a script. But you asked it to put it in an HTML format, right? 

Not yet. Not yet. No, all I did. Not yet. And then, no, again, we're going to make a script that does that. That's going to be the sort of lesson two, once you've got a decent starting point and documents. 

Because you're just thinking through it all, it's worth it. And it does take time. I've done it three, four, five times. And every time, I realized, man, it really does take time. But once you get it and you're making cycles, it's mindless. And then the next time, it's even easier. 

So you don't get ahead of yourself. Making it into some sort of PDF or a doc file is fine, too. The more different document files, Ultimately, you want them all marked down just because it works the best. It's the best medium in between it all. Right. Unless it's like an audio file. 

Well, yeah, then you still convert it to whatever. Everything is just text. Honestly, everything. It's all just text. So if you can in goal, Markdown is probably your best bet. And only in an odd situation, you won't be able to. 

But just make it a PDF. 

because the PDF captures images, right? 

And then so we'll have it captured in the PDF so that we can try to do OCR or, you know, make sure an image model gets the image data from the images. 

So we're not, so we're really doing everything correctly, but that's it. So artifacts can be anything. The only limiting factor to an artifact is quite literally its size because, and what size is the output size? of the AI you're using, the output token length. If it cannot output your entire artifact in one go, then it's probably time to reconsider the size of your artifact. Other than that, an artifact can be anything. 

The more organized, the better, but it can be anything. Gotcha. Yep. Okay. Oh, here's an example. An artifact can even be a set of artifacts. 

So you can put together a complete, this would be an example, of something that would take time but it would be a get a Completed lab or not a lab a lesson that is already completed That is exactly what a completed lesson should look like if you wrap that up into an example Artifact then it will all that will that is literally what few shot learning is It's good. 

You just went from zero shot to one shot. 

It has one example that you're now, you've done some machine learning operations right there. That's what machine learning engineers do is they create these few shot example data sets. That's what it is in point of fact. So that would be an example. If you know yourself a lab or excuse me, a lesson that is perfect. When I made the beacon, I had the beacon one done. 

I used that as my, I had zero shot. 

And then I had my beacon one done. 

I used my beacon one as an example to make the end game. What homework do you need me to do? You will review, step one, review the two resources I give you. You won't need to look at the actual files. 

There are tables of contents for a reason. 

There's just lists of them. Just consider why this is added, right? That kind of thing. That will lead to you, to step two, to creating your own list, your own set. Okay. See. 

Oh, nice. I said the case that's list many times. Yeah. You should have, you should have some work roles. Yeah. Cause I would want to run like, yeah, I guess I'm getting like probably it can be a table, an Excel table. 

Yeah. That's what I was saying. Cause I want to put like ELOs and stuff like in an Excel table. 

So when, when we get a new lessons, that's usually what I do and then organize it and then break them out into different tabs based off of what lab or static content I want those ELOs. 

that section to cover. Here's a smaller one because instructor guides, so that's static content. It was a very small project. Jeff made a change to the instructor guide template, and so we needed to adjust. So I had my initial, I treated it as a draft. I just called it the word draft. 

That way the AI knows it can change it. more than normal. So draft instructor guide, the tasks which contains the lab steps, and then the lab which contains the lab's environment. And then, so that's because it was two labs, so two sets of that. Two sets of that, four files. And then 

the finalized markdown file was the one that I, let me see, that I iterated on. And then once I was finished with it, I brought it back in here as my few shot. Because why would I need to bring back the finalized product back into, I'm done, I'm done. I finished the product. It was in confluence. But then I brought it right back in to continue working on the next, project because I found I was like, well, it's context, right? 

So, okay. So that's just what's in the artifacts. So the four and then the four and the two completed artifacts, 10 files. Is it 10 files? Okay. And then I think I was just, I literally, I just created this as a demo. 

I'm going to delete it, right? I just created that in front of you. And then the instructor guide template, you see what it needs to change into. The template it was see see obviously my script changes it from the pdf nasty into the markdown see Gotcha. 

Yeah, that's what your script will do. 

Um, that's why I have two sets of them, but it's really just the same file Yeah, see and then that this is what this was what your yours yours will look like this without the markdown You'll have the pdf you'll have the pdf versions and then we'll re when whenever you're ready, uh, we'll reconvene See, I even have my prompt file in here. 

This was the prompt to do the um, so this might be even Useful as well. 

I'll read it before I send it, but I was going to give you two I might give you three if I find yeah, this is perfect. 

This actually would be great project constraints Non -technical proctors, right? 

Don't provide back -end infrastructure related information like we use ansible. 

Don't say that 

Just give them the front -end. See, I even said... See, so that's it. And this comes naturally when I didn't like the output. See? Okay. 

Okay, so that'll be what I do to you, and then you take what I give you, review, and then you put together your documents list, and then we'll reconvene and make a script. Sounds good. Cool. And ask questions anytime, offline, anytime. Okay. Um, cause my brain's all over the place. 

We went through, we were lost up. Yeah. I just need a clear, quick list of like what's going to happen next. So you're going to kind of go through and create like an outline and then you want me to review it. 

And then I'm going to give you two files, uh, which are the two files, the big boy files that have 60 cycles in them. 

Um, that you can just go read at cycle zero and read up. Until you feel good, until you've got the ideas to, oh, I need this file, oh, I need this, and just go put the files, and then that's it, keep reading. Go put in some files, keep reading. 

Because you're just drag and dropping PDFs. You're making your, oh, I need this, make it a PDF, drop it in. Because we're not processing anything yet. We're keeping it simple, we're just, yeah. We're getting our ducks in a row, yeah. 

All right, so you're going to send that over to me? 

Yep. Yeah, two files. I'll send it to both of you. It's just two markdown files. And then I'll write an instruction when I send it. Okay. 

So review those files. I'm just writing this down. Review those files. As you get inspiration reviewing them, because they should be full of inspiration. Can you bring up those the cycles again yeah so this is what I got a review right here let me go to the bigger file sorry that one was yes he cycles let me go to cycle zero see I'm just searching cycle zero colon there's only two entrances of it so I don't know what's going on one's probably just a copy and paste ones at the top they're both right next to each other so So I'm just trying to see if those prompts are active. 

So these are like basically what I will, uh, reviewing and see if that's relevant to a static content. So what these are, this is, I went from Oleobits content to completed, end -to -end reviewed, approved UKI content in this file, in this one file. But that's a lab though, right? Labs and lessons. Okay, because right now I'm only focusing on the lessons. 

I'm not dealing with the labs right now. 

I understand. Okay, lesson related stuff. 

There can be. 

Lab related, lesson related. 

Not always am I that organized, but luckily it says it right in front of us. 

Again, this is just messy inspiration. 

When you don't know what to add, come in here and read cycle zero. Because these are tangential parallel problems. I was making lessons in labs for cybersecurity using KSATs and all of our same knowledge artifacts. 

So you'll get inspiration by sitting here and reading this, I promise you. 

Just read the cycles. And then again, see, look, two, three, four. Cycles aren't that, ultimately, that dense at the end of the day, because it's all, you know, you see what I mean? Seven, nine, you know, just... I'm just going to say, to really because again, competencies, I'm just going to have to wrap my head that like you were writing this as you were trying to troubleshoot and get something done. 

Yeah. Obviously, I wasn't there when you did it. So try to comprehend. Oh, right. Right. Yeah. 

You know what I mean? It's going to be like, OK, well, what were you? I kind of have to, like, put a puzzle together. That's that's the problem. That makes sense. That makes a lot of sense. 

Uh, so I'll try to like, I'll go through and try to grab some inspiration. And that's why I said cycle zero cycle one that, you know, it is putting the puzzles. Cause you're going to, you're about to do this, right. You're about to go. Would it be easier if I wrote down the appropriate, like if I recorded all the appropriate steps, like, like it's kind of like in that chat, GPT document that I put in there, like what I, um, like the steps that I have it in there and then kind of like, you know, turn those into cycles and look at what you had and compare. Mine are like super simple. 

No, that can be what happens up in your project plan. I put in the chat here, right at the top, the chat GPT training design. Yeah. And that was just, and again, this is like, so I had a bunch of stuff and I was continuously doing it and then I just threw it all in the chat GPT and then from there I just refined it because it used to be longer, had extra crap in there. You know, this is like what I was trying to get and it puts out a really good output. Like it's pretty good. 

Based off of you know, whatever. So okay. All right. All right. Got it. Got it So this is here's an idea. 

So I'll walk through the whole process from this to an artifact So this you would take this file this PDF and we could call it your initial project plan. Would that be accurate? 

Yeah, that's your artifact zero right artifact one Your your initial project plan. 

So you would take this as a PDF just because it's a PDF even though it's looking like a PDF just text, and you could just copy and paste, and unformatted text, see, you'd go, you'd do a nice PDF markdown so you keep all the formatting, because headers mean many things, not just a header level. But even though this has no formatting whatsoever, we will still treat it as if it did, so that you'll get an idea. 

You would take this PDF, use the script to convert it to markdown, Then you would copy that markdown out, create a new artifact file in the artifacts section. And then that would be, name it, Artifact 1. 

That's how it becomes Artifact 1, because now it's tagged. Artifacts are just, it's just tagging it somehow. Yeah, I like, I want to refine this process right here, because I mean it's not perfect. I just use it and then... That's it, that's it. Once it's Artifact 1, refine it. 

You can say, refine this. This was the rough, exactly. Oh, okay, gotcha, yeah. Yes, yes, that could be, that could be... Like, I continuously, like, I'm like, hey, if it's not providing... Yes, that... 

It doesn't, right now, it just doesn't put it in, like, in the, it doesn't give it the technical review writing style. I do that afterward. I just have it gathered. Add those... But one of the states, I... Yeah. 

Add those pieces of documentation. That would be your Artifact 2, Artifact 3. And that would be one of your first prompts, is update this in line with those. Make a better blueprint for yourself. 

Can you show me quickly, like if you were to do this document quickly? 

I just want to do a step so I can... Yeah, absolutely. So because it's... I will do it simply because it should be able to copy it all because there is no reformatting. And I should be able to go to our repo that we were putting together. And so I'll first make the initial plan markdown. 

This is what the script would produce. It would actually literally look like this. You would not edit it. Who cares? It's fine. It's fine, because it'll be wrapped. 

It will be wrapped. You won't do it. You'll just simply have it here, but you need it tagged, and you would prefer it to be organized, and what better to do than, you know, name it the same thing. I'm just putting the word project, but it doesn't matter. So you create, like, the artifact, mark that, and then you tell it to... Yeah. 

Now, by default, Doing that, that's all you would have to do, because our script, when we run it, it will detect a new file has appeared. It will do this. It will add it. It'll add it to the flattened repo, and then you will just be taking a copy, Control -A. Now, is there a reason if you have it under documents and artifacts, though? Is that because it's just the original? 

That's right. That's right. This is what you originally started with. This is going to be iterated on, isn't it? So I like I'm in my mind in my repo. I want documents to be official documents with static contents, so not markdown, not things that. 

I mean personally, so documents would be like references, like SOPs, things like that, that's official. 

That's right, that's right. It's only markdown. 

No, no, no, no, no. 

It's only markdown, so it's portable for you to copy and paste the text. 

So you can do this. 

That's the only, if you could do... 

No, no, no, yeah, I see. I think, just me, because of my organizational skills, I would want, like, have different document folders, I guess. 

One would be official documentation, which is not like... 

Anything I created this is like the stuff I'm referencing. That's right. That's right So and then so the I would put the initial like if I were gonna say hey, and then I would have like a markdown documents folder. I probably put it in there because I would want to keep it all coming You know what I mean? Yeah, just me personally and that's totally fine. 

And okay. Yes, it doesn't matter then. 

Okay. I just want to make sure Let me say that let me yeah Let me say this again because this is literally going to be Made so that you can move this around and you will never have to think twice Oh, and then so I can create another folder and then again again, it will the one Constraint that you will find out instruction look look I'm predicting this I because I know how it's gonna work The only constraint you will find is you will realize it gets annoying to check the box to select and deselect You will realize it's better if these five files go in a folder so that I can just click click it That's what's gonna happen when you're when you're mature you're that's how you're gonna Constrain your organization is you're just gonna say I don't want to check the boxes as you're flipping around your context It's just much easier if you could check one folder directory, because it contains folders that you know are relevant. 

You can make subfolders in there, can't you? Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

That's what I'm saying. 

Oh, OK. Oh, I'm so sorry. I understand completely now. No, that's just me. No, no, look, look. OK, so a new folder. 

All of my instructions and stuff that I do, I would throw, like, in another. Yeah, official documentation would be, like, the... Well, I guess the... 

The UK, I learned one. 

That's not official documentation. I would say that's your work. Yeah. So I put like an official documentation. I would put all the resources the Navy gave me that they want to build. Yeah. 

Build their instructions. You know, their training off of working doc. Yeah. 

There we go. 

Working documentations. 

Markdown. 

That's me because I like that. 

I know it's a markdown. 

That's the three days. 

This is the three days. 

And for the final and final. And I never wanted to do this organization in my life up until. 

the AI values it, right? 

You see what I'm saying? So it's now fun to be organized. It's valuable. Yeah, that's because I can get, you know, even like my folder structures that I build like on my own computer. Like I try to keep everything is organized. It gets out of hand, but then I go through like here. 

I'll just kind of that's data labeling. That's data labeling. That's data annotation. Yeah, so I'll show you quick. I don't know. That's the skill set. 

That's my pet peeve. Like this is my work document folder right here. I don't know if you can see this. Not yet. Hold on. OK, no, it's still not yet. 

OK, yeah, I'll zoom in. Well, that doesn't. Yeah. I'm bad. 

I'm bad. 

I put everything in one folder. 

I'm really bad Oh, no, so like I have articulate projects and then here but look I have all my LES numbers Yeah in there so I can keep it all organized So that's just and then my actual project files and see doc jqr I have my module one resource module to sort of resource my draft lessons So there will be a moment I can help you out with like that because yeah, I see your fault Like that's what's confusing me is because you have like your documents folders has so much stuff I'm like, okay, but it's I want to keep those documents organized so I can quickly find them like official documents Markdown documents like that. I'm putting together and then uh, you know stuff like that. Um, you know, uh maybe have one that's like template like so yeah that's metadata i was calling it metadata templates folder yeah so like depending on the training i can say hey base off this this is the template i want to use right yep so that's what you need for me then to build out that repo of like the documentation you and you want me to put the documents in there 

That's right. 

And then I'll literally, when we make the scripts, you'll be taking a screenshot. 

You'll be taking a screenshot. 

So it's totally your script. You get what I'm saying? Based off your own, your own, what you want. It's literally what you desire. 

And in the same way, Austin, if making files is a pain for him, then his scripts will be completely written such because that's what he complained to the AI about and that's what the AI fixed for him. 

So Ben will get three different scripts that all do the same thing that then it's going to be good. It's going to be good. But yeah, you're going to realize what you already have organized is in the same way I just went in here and write code dot. You can do that too with your organized file structure and then bada bing bada boom, your entire files would be right here. So you're already, you might be able to do that as well. don't discount this little trick you already learned was the first thing I showed you, was this is why I do it this way? 

Because it's damn powerful, it's easy, it's actually. Yeah, that's what I did. I used that and popped it open. Now go to, now try that. Easy day. Try that. 

The synapses are connecting now. I've got it. Okay, yeah, try that. Go to your other repo. So build out my, what I think I need for my repo. For this job. 

To keep my data organized, and then I'll share that with you. For this task. Once I get that done. Yeah, task specific, right. Because like templates, we can like all we can import all the templates that Brian has put in the conference. We're getting it. 

Yeah, we will. 

That's that's my all my roadmap. 

Actually, I do. 

Yes, that's exactly it. That's the plan. And it will be automatic. That will be. See, I'm going to we're going to make a rag system that will do that. So you don't have to. 

What you're doing here is the proof that that we should spend the money on it. But you're also learning the real freaking skills. 

This is real freaking skills that are translatable and the rest of your life. The time you spend with me will benefit you. for the rest of your life. Oh my goodness. I'm so happy. I'm so happy to share this information. 

Um, so, um, so it's just going to be proof that we will, I will use your, see, I will use your cycles to, to Ben will use your cycles to create an agent that can do some of these things. You'll, you'll be freed to do other things. I don't think you're going to lose your job. I think the people who know how to use the tool. No, that's not comforting. No, no, you know what I'm saying? 

You know what I'm saying? No, me too, me too. I'm in the same boat you are, man, you know? But what protects me is the knowledge of the script. The tool. Yeah, you got to be, you know, we're not recording this, are we? 

Just my own phone. I can stop at this point. Yeah. Yeah.
