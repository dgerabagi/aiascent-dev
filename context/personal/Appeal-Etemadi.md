# **Strategic Analysis and Communications Plan for Doctoral Admissions Reconsideration at The George Washington University**

## **Section 1: Executive Analysis: A Two-Track Strategy for Reconsideration**

### **1.1 Statement of the Primary Challenge: The "Policy-Practice" Conflict**

An analysis of a potential appeal for a rejected Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence (AI) application at The George Washington University's (GWU) School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) reveals a significant and immediate procedural challenge. The candidate's objective—to contact a specific faculty member, Dr. Amir Etemadi, to request a review of the decision—is in direct conflict with explicit university policy.  
The SEAS graduate admissions FAQ, a public-facing guiding document, issues a clear directive for applicants with questions regarding their admissions decisions. The policy states that applicants must contact the central admissions email, engineering@gwu.edu, and specifies, "**NOT** the faculty or academic departments".1  
This policy creates a critical strategic conflict. A naive, direct appeal to Dr. Etemadi that references a rejection or requests an "appeal" would be a severe tactical error. Such a communication would:

1. Demonstrate an inability to follow basic institutional protocols, a disqualifying trait for a doctoral candidate.  
2. Place Dr. Etemadi, a professor and program administrator, in an untenable position, forcing him to either ignore the request or forward it to admissions as a policy violation.

Therefore, any strategy that relies on a direct, explicit appeal to a faculty member is almost certain to fail and may, in fact, preclude any future consideration for admission. The central strategic problem is not *if* the candidate's case has merit, but *how* to compliantly introduce that merit into the review system.

### **1.2 The Recommended Strategic Solution: The "Two-Track" Approach**

A sophisticated, viable strategy must be employed to navigate this "policy-practice" conflict. The objective is to leverage Dr. Etemadi's influence, but the method must be indirect. The recommended solution is a "Two-Track" approach, executing two distinct, parallel communications.

* **Track 1: The Formal Administrative Appeal.** This track represents the "by the book", policy-compliant action. The candidate must submit a formal, professional request for reconsideration to the official SEAS graduate admissions office via the designated email: engineering@gwu.edu.3 The purpose of this communication is *not* to secure an immediate reversal, but to create an official, active, and pending "case file" within the administrative system. This document will serve as the necessary receptacle for any future internal advocacy.  
* **Track 2: The Strategic Faculty Inquiry.** This track represents the "influence" vector, targeting Dr. Etemadi. This communication, sent in parallel or shortly after the Track 1 email, *must not mention the rejection, the application, or the appeal*. It must be framed as a high-level, collegial inquiry from one expert to another. The communication will leverage deep OSINT analysis of Dr. Etemadi's specific research and administrative roles to build rapport, demonstrate exceptional value, and solicit a brief, 15-minute conversation.

These two tracks are designed to be mutually reinforcing. The Formal Appeal (Track 1\) creates an "open case." The Strategic Inquiry (Track 2\) is designed to motivate Dr. Etemadi to become an *internal champion*. When Dr. Etemadi (hypothetically) contacts the admissions office and inquires, "I just had a fascinating conversation with \[Candidate Name\], are they in our applicant pool?", the admissions staff will find the "open case" from Track 1\. This allows Dr. Etemadi to initiate an internal review in a manner that is procedurally sound, policy-compliant, and effective.

## **Section 2: Deconstructing the Decision: The Academic Admissions Lens**

### **2.1 The "Pattern-Matching" Failure: Analysis of the Candidate's Rejection**

Academic doctoral admissions committees are structured to recognize a specific, traditional candidate "pattern": a high GPA from a known institution, prior academic research, co-authorship on publications, and strong letters of recommendation from established academics.  
The candidate's profile does not fit this pattern. The self-described background includes terms like "vibe coding," "technical trainer," and "two jobs." An admissions committee, reviewing hundreds of applications, likely "pattern-matched" this profile incorrectly, resulting in a rejection based on a critical failure of translation.

* "Vibe coding" (industry jargon for agile, practical development) may have been interpreted as "unstructured" or "unserious."  
* "Technical Trainer" at Palo Alto Networks may have been miscategorized as a pedagogical or sales-support role, failing to recognize the deep, applied cybersecurity expertise it requires.  
* "Training Gemini" may have been dismissed as puffery, rather than what it is: applied, cutting-edge research in Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning and alignment.  
* "Two jobs," including one for the NSA, may have been viewed as a lack of focus or a sign of a "distracted" candidate, rather than a demonstration of extreme drive and high-level capability in mission-critical environments.

The purpose of the appeal is to correct this "pattern-matching" failure. The candidate must provide the translation *for* the committee, re-framing this non-traditional industry experience into the high-impact academic and research-equivalent value it represents.

### **2.2 The "Translation Matrix": Converting Industry Experience to Academic Value**

The core of the "connecting story" for both the formal appeal (Track 1\) and the strategic inquiry (Track 2\) is the re-contextualization of the candidate's C.V. This re-framing aligns the candidate's practical, high-impact background with the specific programmatic and research goals of GWU SEAS and Dr. Etemadi.  
This re-framing is essential. The candidate's background aligns powerfully with the practitioner-focused **Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.)** programs 4 that Dr. Etemadi helps administer.4 The Ph.D. application may have been seen as a "type mismatch," whereas the D.Eng. or a re-framed Ph.D. application is a perfect fit.  
The following matrix provides the precise language for this translation.

| Candidate's Terminology | Academic / Strategic Translation | Connection to GWU / Etemadi |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| "vibe coding" (3 years) | "Three years of documented experience in rapid prototyping and agile software development, specializing in high-tempo, results-driven environments." | Aligns with Dr. Etemadi's research on DoD acquisition and the efficacy of **agile software development** for shortening project cycle times.7 |
| "technical trainer at Palo Alto Networks" | "Domain expert in applied network security; developed advanced pedagogical frameworks for training cybersecurity professionals on threat detection, mitigation, and adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)." | Connects directly to Dr. Etemadi's recent, supervised research in **cyber-attack detection** and "Adversary Engagement Platforms".8 |
| "i train gemini" | "Applied researcher in Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, behavior alignment, prompt engineering, and reinforcement learning applications." | Aligns directly with the curriculum Dr. Etemadi administers as Assistant Director for Analytics 4, specifically courses like **"Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning"** (SEAS 6510 / SEAS 8520), which covers LLMs.6 |
| "cybersecurity training for the NSA" | "Expert in developing secure-by-design training modules for national security applications; possesses deep practical knowledge of state-level adversary TTPs in the cyber-physical domain." | Connects to Dr. Etemadi's government-facing work (NSF-funded) 11 and his research into the security of critical national infrastructure (the power grid).12 |
| "i am driven" | "Demonstrated capacity for managing simultaneous, high-stakes projects in mission-critical, zero-failure environments for both commercial (Palo Alto) and national security (NSA) stakeholders." | Reframes "two jobs" from a distraction to a testament of high-energy, high-capability executive function. |

## **Section 3: Intelligence Profile: Dr. Amir Etemadi (Ph.D., P.E.)**

### **3.1 The Core Identity: Power Systems, Control, and Reliability (The "Outer Shell")**

Dr. Amir Etemadi's primary, public-facing academic identity is that of a classical Electrical Engineer. He is an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.13 His academic pedigree is traditional and strong: a BSc from the University of Tehran, MSc from Sharif University of Technology, and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Toronto.15  
He is a licensed Professional Engineer (P.E.) 4 and an active member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 15, specifically the Power Engineering Society.13  
His foundational research is unequivocally in power systems, simulation, and control theory.14 An analysis of his publications and faculty profile shows a deep focus on:

* **Microgrid Operation:** Control, protection, and realization of microgrids.13  
* **Renewable Energy Integration:** Modeling and control of wind and solar power plants.13  
* **Power System Reliability:** His research is heavily sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) for topics like "Catastrophic impacts of geomagnetic disturbances on power system operation".11  
* **Control Strategies:** He is an expert in "Control Theory" 14, with a specific focus on Finite-Control-Set Model Predictive Control (FCS-MPC) for stabilizing power systems.17

A superficial review would conclude Dr. Etemadi is a "power systems professor" and a poor fit for a pure AI candidate. This conclusion is incorrect. His entire field—control, simulation, and reliability—is currently being revolutionized by AI and Machine Learning. He is not an *AI theorist* but a domain expert who *applies* advanced analytics to solve physical-systems problems. This makes him an "AI applicator," a critical distinction that aligns with the candidate's practical profile.

### **3.2 The Administrative Identity: Architect of the AI Program (The "Influence Vector")**

The most critical, high-value, and high-leverage finding is Dr. Etemadi's administrative identity. He serves as the **"Assistant Director for Analytics"** for the GW Online Engineering Programs.4  
This is not a nominal title. Dr. Etemadi is part of the core leadership team (along with Drs. Sarkani and Mazzuchi) credited with the "meteoric rise" of GW's online engineering programs, which jumped from \#55 to \#8 in the U.S. News & World Report rankings.18 This context reveals him as a "program builder" with a significant, strategic, and administrative interest in the success and prestige of these programs.  
Crucially, the programs he directly administers are the **Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** and the **Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**.4  
This administrative role provides a profound leverage point.

1. It explains *why* a power systems professor holds an "analytics" directorship: "analytics" (i.e., AI/ML) is the methodological core that now connects all modern engineering disciplines.  
2. He has a direct, strategic interest in recruiting high-caliber students who elevate the reputation of the AI programs he helped build.  
3. The D.Eng. program 5 is a *practitioner's doctorate*, explicitly designed for high-level industry professionals. The candidate's profile (Palo Alto Networks, Google/Gemini, NSA) is not that of a "typical student" but of a *high-prestige professional* who would be a "star" of a D.Eng. cohort.

Any communication with Dr. Etemadi must appeal to *both* his identities: him as a Professor (research) and him as an Administrator (programmatic and strategic).

### **3.3 The Strategic Bridge: Etemadi's Applied AI & Cybersecurity Research (The "Connecting Story")**

The ideal "connecting story" bridges the candidate's "AI/Cyber" background with Dr. Etemadi's "Power Systems" core. This bridge exists in his recent, applied, and non-obvious research interests. Dr. Etemadi's core work on power grid reliability is increasingly intersecting with the domain of cybersecurity.

* **Data Point 1: The Cybersecurity Dissertation.** In 2023, Dr. Etemadi served as a **Committee Member** for a dissertation titled "Cyber Deception Techniques and an Adversary Engagement Platform for Cybersecurity Enhancement".8 This dissertation explicitly analyzed the **Solar Winds** security breach and studied "malicious actors" and "Moving Target Defense (MTD)".8 This is a direct, high-level, and recent engagement with the candidate's precise domain of expertise.  
* **Data Point 2: Cyber-Attack Detection Publications.** Dr. Etemadi has co-authored and supervised recent (2023-2024) research on "feature selection techniques based on filtering methods for cyber attack detection".9 This shows a clear, active research interest in applying ML/AI to cybersecurity.  
* **Data Point 3: Secure Critical Infrastructure.** His research portfolio includes work on "A Cyber-Secure Distributed Control Architecture" 12 and "Machine learning-based intrusion detection for achieving cybersecurity in smart grids".21

This evidence provides the "connecting story." Dr. Etemadi's primary research domain (the power grid) is a cyber-physical system. Its greatest threat (reliability) now comes from the candidate's primary professional domain (cyber-attack). Dr. Etemadi is *already* moving his research in this direction.8 The candidate's background at Palo Alto Networks (a top-tier intrusion detection firm) and with the NSA makes them a subject-matter expert on the very "malicious actors" 8 and adversary TTPs that Dr. Etemadi's academic models are trying to detect.  
This re-frames the candidate from an "AI student" to a *potential research collaborator* who brings rare, practical, front-line data and expertise to Dr. Etemadi's new research vector.

### **3.4 The Network: Government & National Labs (The "Shared Ecosystem")**

Finally, Dr. Etemadi is not a purely theoretical academic. He operates within the same government-funded, national-security-adjacent ecosystem as the candidate.

* **Government Funding:** He is a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded researcher, working on high-stakes, large-scale problems like "geomagnetic disturbances" and their impact on power system operations.11  
* **National Labs:** He has active research collaborations with Sandia National Laboratories, co-authoring publications and citing Sandia's resilience frameworks.8  
* **DoD Research:** He has conducted research on Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition strategies, particularly focusing on the use of **agile software development** and government-industry partnerships to accelerate "rapid acquisition".7

This context is vital. He "speaks the language" of government contracts, national labs, and DoD/IC requirements. He will immediately understand the gravity and level of the candidate's work at the NSA and Palo Alto Networks. These organizations can be "name-dropped" not as a brag, but as a signal of a shared professional context and a shared, mission-driven focus on national security.

## **Section 4: Building the "Connecting Story": The Nexus of Three Domains**

This analysis synthesizes the candidate's re-framed profile (Section 2.2) with Dr. Etemadi's multi-faceted identity (Section 3\) to construct three precise, actionable narratives. These "convergence points" are the substance of the Track 2 strategic inquiry.

### **4.1 Convergence Point 1: The Cybersecurity Nexus (Palo Alto / NSA \+ Cyber-Attack Detection)**

This narrative directly connects the candidate's practical cybersecurity experience with Dr. Etemadi's emerging research on cyber-attack detection.

* **The Narrative:** "The candidate's professional life is spent designing defenses and training modules against the exact 'malicious actors' 8 that Dr. Etemadi's recent research seeks to model. The candidate's work at Palo Alto Networks provided practical, enterprise-scale expertise in intrusion detection that could directly inform and validate the 'feature selection techniques for cyber-attack detection' 9 his group is pursuing. The 'Adversary Engagement Platform' dissertation 8 he advised is a vital academic framework for the applied, classified work the candidate performs at the national security level."  
* **Strategic Goal:** This frames the candidate as a source of *practical data* and *adversary insight*—a rare commodity in academia—that can enhance Dr. Etemadi's own research.

### **4.2 Convergence Point 2: The Generative AI Nexus (Gemini \+ Program Administrator)**

This narrative appeals directly to Dr. Etemadi's *administrative* role as the "Assistant Director for Analytics" 4 and architect of the AI/ML programs.

* **The Narrative:** "As the administrator for the D.Eng./M.Eng. in AI/ML 4, Dr. Etemadi has a unique appreciation for the practical challenges of applied AI. The candidate's current work 'training Gemini' involves the very topics his program teaches, such as **'Natural Language Processing'** (SEAS 8520), **'Large Language Models'** 6, **'Generative AI'** (SEAS 8525\) 6, and **'Secure & Trustworthy AI'** (SEAS 6525).10 The candidate is seeking a D.Eng./Ph.D. to build a formal, research-based structure around these cutting-edge, 'in-the-wild' industry challenges."  
* **Strategic Goal:** This appeals to his administrative identity. It demonstrates that the candidate's skills are at (or beyond) the level of the curriculum, and that the candidate would be a prestige-enhancing addition to his D.Eng. or Ph.D. cohort, one who could mentor other students and bring in high-value, real-world problems.

### **4.3 Convergence Point 3: The National Security Nexus (NSA/Sandia \+ Critical Infrastructure)**

This narrative provides the *unifying theme* for the conversation. It elevates the exchange from "student asking for admission" to "two professionals discussing a shared, high-stakes mission."

* **The Narrative:** "The candidate's career—from securing commercial networks at Palo Alto to developing training for the NSA—is focused on protecting critical systems. Dr. Etemadi's profile clearly demonstrates a shared mission, albeit from the Electrical Engineering perspective. His NSF-funded work on grid resilience 11 and collaborations with Sandia National Labs 25 are part of the same national-level effort to protect critical infrastructure. The candidate's goal is to bridge expertise in the *cyber-security* of these systems with the *physical-systems* research Dr. Etemadi's lab is known for."  
* **Strategic Goal:** This establishes a peer-level, mission-driven context, creating a powerful foundation of mutual respect and shared purpose.

## **Section 5: Actionable Communications Plan & Drafting Recommendations**

This section provides actionable templates for executing the Two-Track strategy.

### **5.1 Track 1: The Formal Appeal (To: engineering@gwu.edu)**

* **Objective:** To create an official, "active" case file in the SEAS admissions system that justifies a formal review by providing a "translation" of the candidate's non-traditional qualifications.  
* **Tone:** Formal, professional, respectful, concise.  
* **Subject:** Request for Reconsideration of Doctoral Application (App ID:) \- \[Candidate's Full Name\]  
* **Key Drafting Components:**  
  1. **Opening:** The candidate should state their profound and continued interest in the GWU School of Engineering and Applied Science. They should acknowledge the admissions decision and respectfully request a formal review or reconsideration.  
  2. **The "Translation" Argument:** The candidate should state that they believe their non-traditional background, which is rooted in high-impact industry practice rather than a linear academic path, may have been "mis-patterned" by a standard academic review.  
  3. **Deploy the "Translation Matrix":** The candidate should use 2-3 brief paragraphs to explicitly re-frame their experience using the language from Section 2.2.  
     * "My work as a Technical Trainer at Palo Alto Networks provided me with domain expertise in applied network security and threat detection."  
     * "My current role in 'training Gemini' is equivalent to applied research in LLM fine-tuning, alignment, and prompt engineering, skills directly relevant to the AI program's curriculum."  
     * "My contract work developing cybersecurity training for the NSA has given me practical insight into national-level adversary TTPs."  
  4. **Connect to GWU:** The candidate should explicitly state why this experience makes them a unique and ideal candidate. They should mention the **Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) in AI/ML** 5 as a program that seems perfectly aligned with their practitioner-expert profile, indicating flexibility in their doctoral path (Ph.D. or D.Eng.). They should also reference the curriculum, noting the powerful fit with courses like **SEAS 6525 "Secure & Trustworthy AI"**.10  
  5. **Closing:** The candidate should thank the committee for their time and consideration and attach an updated C.V. that *uses this new, translated language*.

### **5.2 Track 2: The Strategic Inquiry (To: Dr. Amir Etemadi)**

* **Objective:** To bypass the admissions "firewall" and engage Dr. Etemadi as an internal champion. This email's sole objective is to secure a 15-minute virtual meeting.  
* **CRITICAL:** This email **must not** mention the rejection, the application, the appeal, or the word "admission."  
* **Tone:** Collegial, expert-to-expert, curious, concise, and respectful.  
* **Subject:** Query from a Cybersecurity Practitioner re: Your Research in Cyber-Attack Detection OR Inquiry re: Applied LLMs and your "Cyber Deception" 8 work  
* **Key Drafting Components:**  
  1. **The Hook (Show the homework):** "Dear Dr. Etemadi, I am a cybersecurity and applied AI practitioner. I've been following your group's research and was particularly struck by your involvement in the 2023 dissertation 'Cyber Deception Techniques... for Cybersecurity Enhancement' 8 and your more recent work on 'feature selection for cyber attack detection'.9"  
  2. **The "Connecting Story" (Establish value):** "My professional work is on the front-lines of this exact problem. I currently develop cybersecurity training for national security (NSA) clients and am also doing applied work on LLM alignment (Google's Gemini). I am consistently finding that academic models for adversary detection, like those in the 8 dissertation, could benefit immensely from the high-fidelity, real-world adversary TTP data I work with daily."  
  3. **The Nexus (Acknowledge dual-identity):** "I see you are also the Assistant Director for Analytics for the AI/ML programs.4 I believe this dual-role gives you a unique perspective on the intersection of academic AI research and its practical, industry-led application."  
  4. **The "Call to Action" (The 15-minute meeting):** "I am in the process of exploring pathways to bridge my industry experience with a formal research framework, and your work at the nexus of AI, cybersecurity, and infrastructure is the closest alignment I have found. Would you be open to a brief, 15-minute virtual call in the coming weeks? I would be fascinated to learn more about your research and the industry-to-academia pipeline at GWU."  
  5. **Closing:** "Respectfully, \[Candidate's Full Name\]. \[Link to Candidate's LinkedIn Profile\]."

## **Section 6: Summary of Actionable Recommendations & Risk Assessment**

### **6.1 Summary of Actions**

1. **Immediately:** The candidate must revise their C.V. and LinkedIn profile to reflect the high-impact, professional language of the "Translation Matrix" (Section 2.2).  
2. **First:** Send the "Track 1: Formal Appeal" email to engineering@gwu.edu 3 to create the official case file.  
3. **Second:** Two to three business days later, send the "Track 2: Strategic Inquiry" email to Dr. Etemadi.  
4. **Prepare:** The candidate must prepare for the 15-minute meeting by having 3-4 specific, high-level questions about *Dr. Etemadi's research* (e.g., "In the 8 dissertation, did the adversary engagement platform find...?" "In your 9 feature selection work, how do you source...").

### **6.2 Risk Assessment & Mitigation**

* **Risk:** The Formal Appeal (Track 1\) is rejected by a form letter.  
  * **Mitigation:** This is an expected outcome. The Track 1 communication is not designed to *succeed* on its own. It is a procedural necessity designed to *exist* in the administrative system for Track 2 to activate.  
* **Risk:** Dr. Etemadi ignores the Track 2 email.  
  * **Mitigation:** This is a primary risk. He is a busy professor and administrator. The candidate may send one (1) respectful, concise follow-up email 7-10 business days later (e.g., "Dear Dr. Etemadi, just bringing this back to the top of your inbox..."). If that is ignored, the operation has failed, but at no cost.  
* **Risk:** Dr. Etemadi forwards the Track 2 email to admissions, who see it as a policy violation.  
  * **Mitigation:** This is the primary risk this entire strategy is designed to mitigate. Because the email *is not an appeal*, it cannot be treated as a violation. It is a legitimate, expert-to-expert research inquiry. This framing provides Dr. Etemadi with "plausible deniability" and gives the candidate a professional, safe, and respectful opening.

### **6.3 Concluding Analysis**

The candidate's profile is that of a "driven," high-impact practitioner. The "pattern-matching" failure of the admissions committee is a correctable error. Dr. Etemadi's dual-identity as a Power Systems researcher moving into Cyber-Security 8 and a key AI Program Administrator 4 makes him the perfect, high-leverage target *if approached correctly*.  
This two-track strategy moves the candidate from the passive, supplicant position of a "rejected applicant" to the active, professional position of a "colleague-in-waiting." By translating their experience into his language and engaging him on his specific, high-level research, the candidate demonstrates the exact qualities of a high-level doctoral candidate: strategic, analytical, and "driven."
