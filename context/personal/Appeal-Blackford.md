# **Strategic Communications & OSINT Analysis: Re-evaluating the GWU Doctoral Application**

DATE: October 26, 2024  
TO: \[User\]  
FROM:  
**SUBJECT:** Strategic analysis and communication plan for application decision reconsideration request directed at Dr. J.P. Blackford.

## **I. Executive Summary of Strategic Findings**

This report details a comprehensive open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis and strategic communications plan designed to address the rejection of a doctoral application to the George Washington University (GWU) School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS). The applicant, an industry practitioner with extensive experience in cybersecurity, AI, and national security training, was rejected from the Ph.D. in AI program.  
The core finding of this analysis is that the rejection was likely due to a fundamental *programmatic misalignment* rather than a lack of qualifications. The applicant's practitioner-focused profile (Palo Alto Networks, NSA, UKI) is a mismatch for a traditional, theory-based Ph.D. in AI. However, this same profile is an *exact match* for a different, more appropriate program offered by SEAS: the **Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**.1  
The target for the appeal, Dr. J.P. Blackford, is not only an Associate Professor but also the **Doctoral Program Coordinator for the Online Engineering Programs**—the precise administrator with oversight of the D.Eng. program.3 Furthermore, Dr. Blackford's own background as a D.Eng. graduate 3, his past work in applied industry roles 4, and his focus on innovation and entrepreneurship 3 make him uniquely receptive to a practitioner's profile.  
Therefore, the recommended strategy is **not** to appeal the Ph.D. rejection. Such an action is procedurally unlikely to succeed. The strategy is to pivot and petition for a **programmatic re-alignment**, respectfully requesting that the existing application file be re-activated and re-evaluated for the D.Eng. in AI & Machine Learning. This request will be framed by leveraging powerful, non-obvious connections between the applicant's background and the strategic priorities of both Dr. Blackford and GWU Engineering.

## **II. Analysis of the GWU SEAS Appeal Process (The 'Hard' Hurdle)**

A review of the official GWU and SEAS policies reveals a significant procedural obstacle: there is no formal, documented process for appealing a *graduate admissions* rejection.  
The university's "Academic Appeals & Petitions" page details processes exclusively for *current* students.5 These processes include:

* **Petition for Exception to Academic Policies:** This is for existing students seeking exceptions to rules, which must be signed by a faculty advisor or department chair.5  
* **Grade Grievance Process:** This is for resolving disputes over course grades.5  
* **Academic Suspension Appeal:** This is for students appealing a suspension due to poor academic performance.5  
* **Financial Aid Appeals:** This is for students with changes in financial circumstances.5

The admissions-specific "Frequently Asked Questions" page reinforces this procedural wall. In response to the query, "Who do I contact if I have questions regarding my admissions decision?" the policy explicitly states: **"Please contact engineering@gwu.edu, NOT the faculty or academic departments"**.8  
This analysis leads to a critical conclusion: any attempt to follow the "official" path by emailing the general engineering@gwu.edu address with a generic "appeal" will almost certainly fail. It will be met with a standardized response stating that all decisions are final.  
The only viable path is an "off-book" petition that bypasses the general admissions inbox and goes directly to a decision-maker with the authority to grant an exception. The "Petition for Exception" process 5, while not directly applicable, provides the correct *language*. The request must be framed as a petition for an exception, backed by "comprehensive documentation" demonstrating "extenuating circumstances"—in this case, the extenuating circumstance being the fundamental mismatch between the applicant's profile and the program they applied for.

## **III. OSINT Profile: Dr. J.P. Blackford (The 'Human' Target)**

The success of the petition hinges on Dr. J.P. Blackford. He is the correct target not because he is a professor in the AI department, but because he is the key *administrator* for the program the applicant should have applied to.

### **A. Administrative Role & Programmatic Authority**

Dr. Blackford's official titles confirm his administrative authority. He is the "Associate Professor of Engineering and Applied Science" and, most importantly, the **"Assistant Director for Administration"** and **"Doctoral Program Coordinator for the Online Engineering Programs Office"**.3  
The target program, the D.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, is offered as an online program.2 This places it directly under Dr. Blackford's administrative purview. He is not just a faculty member; he is the coordinator responsible for the doctoral programs. This role provides him with the necessary authority to review an unusual request and, if convinced, action it by routing the file for a new review.

### **B. Academic & Professional DNA (The "Practitioner-Leader")**

The most significant finding from the OSINT analysis is that Dr. Blackford's professional DNA is that of a "practitioner-leader," not a pure theoretician. This creates a powerful 'common ground' narrative.

1. **He is a Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.):** Dr. Blackford's own doctorate is a **D.Eng. in Engineering Management** from GWU.3 He is a product of the very practitioner-focused doctoral system the applicant is now targeting. He will inherently understand the difference between a Ph.D. and a D.Eng. and the value of an application strong in practice but light on traditional academic publications.  
2. **He Has an Applied Industry/Policy Background:** Before his full-time academic role, Dr. Blackford worked as a **"Senior Environmental Services Engineer at the American Public Power Association (APPA)"**.4 His role involved "technical, regulatory, and compliance assistance" and "filing comments on environmental regulations with the EPA".4 This is applied, real-world engineering and policy work, directly parallel to the applicant's high-level technical training and compliance work at Palo Alto Networks and for the NSA.  
3. **He Champions Innovation and "Hands-On" Experience:** Dr. Blackford's profile highlights two key experiences:  
   * He led a GW team in the **"NSF-sponsored Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program,"** which explicitly "focused on entrepreneurial initiatives and innovation".3  
   * He served as the **"director of the Science and Engineering Apprentice Program (SEAP),"** a program designed to foster STEM careers through **"hands-on experiences"**.3

This profile—a D.Eng. holder with a background in applied industry, regulation, innovation, and hands-on STEM education—makes Dr. Blackford the ideal audience for this petition. He is a 'translator' who bridges the gap between industry and academia.

### **C. Research & Departmental Alignment**

Dr. Blackford is a faculty member in the **Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering (EMSE)**.10 His published research and directorial work confirm his focus on complex, applied systems:

* He co-authored "A Traffic Density Analysis of Proposed Ferry Service Expansion in San Francisco Bay Utilizing Maritime Simulation," published in *Reliability Engineering and System Safety*.3  
* He served as the Praxis Director for a 2023 D.Eng. dissertation titled "Schedule Forecast Optimization for the Construction and Commissioning of Nuclear Power Plants".14

Dr. Blackford's academic focus is on the *management*, *simulation*, and *risk/reliability* of complex, real-world systems (e.g., maritime traffic, nuclear power plant construction). This provides a clear thematic link to the applicant's work in managing the complex, real-world risks of cybersecurity systems and AI models.

## **IV. Analysis of Institutional & Programmatic Alignment**

The case for admission becomes compelling when the applicant's profile is viewed not just against Dr. Blackford, but against the university's own strategic programs.

### **A. The Target Program: D.Eng. in AI & Machine Learning**

The Ph.D. was the wrong target. The D.Eng. in AI & Machine learning is the correct one.

* **Program Goal:** It is explicitly "designed to provide graduates with a solid understanding of the latest AI\&ML techniques, as well as hands-on experience in applying these techniques to real-world problems".1  
* **Target Candidate:** It is designed "to equip graduates to lead AI\&ML projects and teams in a wide range of industries".1

The applicant's profile—a technical trainer at Palo Alto Networks, a developer of cybersecurity training for the NSA, and a trainer of Gemini models—is a textbook example of an industry leader who applies AI/ML to "real-world problems" and is positioned to "lead... projects and teams." The rejection from the Ph.D. program, which values theoretical research and publications, is understandable; this same profile would be exceptionally strong for the D.Eng. program.

### **B. The Strategic Nexus: AI \+ Cybersecurity at GWU**

The applicant's "driven" nature is demonstrated by their simultaneous work in AI (training Gemini) and national security (NSA cybersecurity training). This precise intersection is a core strategic priority for GWU SEAS.

1. **The NSA Connection:** GWU is federally designated as a **"National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Research"** by the **National Security Agency (NSA)** and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).15 The university's Cyber Security and Privacy Research Institute (CSPRI) is funded by DHS and the NSF.16 The applicant's work *for* the NSA is not a minor detail; it places them directly within the university's most significant institutional and governmental partnerships.  
2. **The Faculty Precedent:** The SEAS faculty already includes professionals with this exact background. Dr. Benjamin Harvey, a Research Professor in Dr. Blackford's own EMSE department, previously worked at the **NSA** for nearly a decade, with his final position being **"Chief of Operations Data Science."** He also served as a Lead Data Scientist at **Databricks**, supporting "federal customers".18 The applicant's profile is not an anomaly; it is a *precedent*.  
3. **The Programmatic Focus:** The EMSE department, which Dr. Blackford helps administer, is deeply invested in this nexus. It offers a D.Eng. in Cybersecurity Analytics 2 and an M.Eng. in Cybersecurity Policy and Compliance 19, with courses on "Cybersecurity Risk Management".20 This focus on AI, cybersecurity, policy, and risk is a central research theme for the entire department.21

The applicant's profile aligns perfectly with the institutional mission (NSA center), the faculty composition (Dr. Harvey), and the administrative leadership (Dr. Blackford).

## **V. Actionable Recommendations & Communication Strategy**

### **A. The Core Strategy: The "Programmatic Re-alignment" Pivot**

The communication must not be an *appeal*. It must be a *petition for programmatic re-alignment*.

1. **Acknowledge and Respect:** The email must begin by respectfully acknowledging the Ph.D. rejection and *not* challenging its validity.  
2. **Identify the Mismatch:** Clearly and professionally state the hypothesis: that the applicant's practitioner profile was an imperfect fit for a theoretical Ph.D.  
3. **Identify the Correct Fit:** Introduce the D.Eng. in AI & Machine Learning as the correct, more aligned program, quoting its own description ("real-world problems," "leadership roles in industry").1  
4. **Request Re-evaluation:** The "ask" is not for a reversal. The "ask" is to have the *existing application file* re-activated and re-evaluated by the D.Eng. committee.  
5. **Provide New Materials:** The applicant must prepare (and attach to the email) a new Statement of Purpose written *specifically* for the D.Eng. program, along with an updated CV.

### **B. The Narrative (The "Connecting Story")**

The email must subtly weave in the "connecting story" identified in this analysis. The applicant should (and the draft below does) connect these dots:

* **Connection 1 (Programmatic):** "I am a practitioner-leader, and I am writing to you because you run the D.Eng. practitioner program." (This leverages Dr. Blackford's D.Eng. 3 and his role as coordinator 3).  
* **Connection 2 (Institutional):** "My work in AI and national security cybersecurity is a direct fit for GW's strategic mission." (This leverages the NSA designation 15 and the faculty precedent 18).  
* **Connection 3 (Research):** "My hands-on, innovative work is valuable." (This leverages Dr. Blackford's I-Corps innovation 3 and SEAP hands-on experience 3 background).

### **C. The Communication Tactic (Email Draft)**

The following email should be sent. It is addressed to the "process" (engineering@gwu.edu) but immediately C.C.s the "human" target (Dr. Blackford). This satisfies the official procedure while ensuring the request lands on the desk of the only person who can act on it.  
To: engineering@gwu.edu  
Cc: jblackford@gwu.edu (Note: This email address is inferred from faculty naming conventions; the user should verify this. An alternative seed@gwu.edu is also listed 10 but appears to be a general department alias. Targeting his direct email is stronger.)  
Subject: Petition for Programmatic Re-evaluation –, Application ID \#  
**Body:**  
Dear Graduate Admissions Committee,  
I am writing to respectfully petition for a reconsideration of the decision on my application (ID \#) for the Ph.D. program in Artificial Intelligence.  
I fully respect the committee’s decision. However, I believe my application may have been evaluated against a rubric for which my profile—that of a senior industry practitioner rather than a traditional academic—is an imperfect fit.  
My petition is not to challenge the Ph.D. decision, but to request that my application be re-activated and re-evaluated for a different, more aligned program: the **Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**.  
My reasoning is as follows:

1. **Programmatic Alignment:** My professional background involves hands-on application and leadership in AI and cybersecurity at organizations like Palo Alto Networks, as well as developing cybersecurity training for the NSA and applied model refinement for generative AI (Gemini). The D.Eng. program, which is explicitly "designed to provide graduates with... hands-on experience in applying these techniques to real-world problems" and "prepare graduates for leadership roles in industry" 1, appears to be the correct, intended program for my profile.  
2. **Institutional & Strategic Alignment:** My work operates at the exact intersection of AI and Cybersecurity—a core strategic focus for GW Engineering, as evidenced by its "CyberAI Project" 22 and its status as an NSA/DHS "National Center of Academic Excellence".15 My NSA-related experience aligns with the profile of existing SEAS faculty 18, confirming that GW is a world-leader in bridging this specific national security and technology gap.

I have included Dr. J.P. Blackford, the Doctoral Program Coordinator for the Online Engineering Programs 3, on this email, as my research indicates the D.Eng. in AI\&ML falls under his administrative purview. His own background with the NSF I-Corps program 3 suggests a deep understanding of the value that industry practitioners bring to engineering innovation.  
I have attached a brief petition that further details this case, along with an updated CV and a new Statement of Purpose written specifically for the D.Eng. program. I am confident that, when viewed through the D.Eng. practitioner lens, my application demonstrates a strong capacity for original, applied scholarship.  
Thank you for your time and for considering this request for programmatic re-alignment.  
Sincerely,
