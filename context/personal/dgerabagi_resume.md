Projects
Data Curation Environment (DCE) & aiascent.dev (Lead Architect & Developer)                             Mar 2025 - Present
Project Link: https://aiascent.dev/
Project Description:
Conceived and architected the Data Curation Environment (DCE), a VS Code extension that revolutionizes the human-AI 
development workflow. The DCE transforms AI collaboration from an ad-hoc, conversational process into a structured, 
auditable, and highly efficient engineering discipline. The project includes the aiascent.dev website, which serves as both
a promotional platform for a living demonstration of the DCE's capabilities, as it was built entirely using the tool itself.
Project Highlights: 
● Architectural Vision & Metainterpretability: Designed and built a novel "Process as Asset" framework where the 
entire development workflow—context curation, AI prompts, parallel responses, and developer decisions—is 
captured as a persistent, navigable knowledge graph. This provides unprecedented auditability and enables a 
meta-interpretability loop where the AI is given its own parsing logic as context.
● Full-Stack Tool Development: Engineered a comprehensive VS Code extension using TypeScript, React, and 
Webview technology, featuring multiple custom panels for context curation and parallel AI response management.
● Advanced AI Integration & RAG: Deployed and managed local LLMs (vLLM) and developed a multi-tenant 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with dual knowledge bases (FAISS vector indexes), allowing the 
integrated AI assistant, @Ascentia, to provide context-specific expertise on different topics.
● DevOps & CI/CD: Designed and managed a complete, self-hosted deployment pipeline for aiascent.dev, including 
DNS, a Caddy reverse proxy for secure HTTPS, and process management, mirroring production DevOps workflows.
● Human-AI Workflow Innovation: Created the "Parallel Co-Pilot Panel," an integrated UI for managing, comparing, 
diffing, and safely testing multiple, simultaneous AI-generated code solutions, dramatically accelerating the 
iterative development cycle.
Catalyst AI – A Cloud-Based GAIaaS Solution for Slack Workspaces                    May 2023
Project Highlights: 
● Pioneering "Vibe Coding": Developed a hybrid/multi-cloud AI-as-a-Service platform, Catalyst AI, through an 
intuitive, iterative process now known as "vibe coding." The platform includes a fully-automated Slack bot and 
website with end-to-end deployment. 
● Collaborative AI in Slack: Engineered a "multiplayer GPT" by integrating Generative AI into Slack with Python, 
enabling users to learn by observing colleagues' AI interactions and boosting adoption of AI tools. 
● Early RAG Implementation: Employed a Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for semantic 
searches against user-uploaded PDF content, delivering capabilities that surpassed standard ChatGPT 13 months 
before the term "RAG" was widely adopted. 
● SaaS Architecture & Security: Re-architected the project into a scalable, near-zero marginal cost SaaS model and
implemented defense-in-depth security protocols.
