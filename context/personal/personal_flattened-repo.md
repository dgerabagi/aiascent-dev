Good morning Avneesh,
I've connected with the individual who moved me to the Python team. She began reaching out to her POC, who
then pointed her to another person. While she is tracking this down, she said that you should also have someone
that you could reach out to on the GL side to discuss this as well.
Thanks,

Sure thing, below are the answers in-line to your questions:
1. Are you doing Python coding - 
Yes
2. Date of team change- The transition took place midday yesterday, on 5/7/2024. Today is my
first full day on the team, where I began training with the Python team members.
3. what are your responsibilities in the new role - We are given user Google queries, such as
'show me home improvement stores where i can get a good variety of indoor plants for pots
and soil'. We then create the following deliverables: ##QUERY INTENT, ## STRATEGY, ##
STRATEGY REASONING, ## STRATEGY STEPS. Finally, we write the Python script that
would pull the information needed to fulfill the query using a combination of Google Search
API and Google Maps API. The product we create will then go to train the model on how to
answer similar questions in the future. This work can be classified as a form of Supervised
Learning from the domain of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Research. It was
explained to us in training today that they used to estimate that the Python team does
roughly 2x more than the Content Writing team, but now they've determined it is closer to 3x
the amount of work as the other team.

Good morning,
The client had a need on the Junior Python Developer team for someone with experience in writing
and experience in coding. The current new members of the Junior Python Developer team were
able to perform the coding, but their written English was not up to the needs of the client. By
switching teams, I am fulfilling this need for the client.
My OSINT has shown me that the Junior Python Developer position for this client was offering
roughly 50% more hourly rate. Since there are multiple layers in between the client and myself, how
might I go about initiating a review of this job change in order to receive a compensatory update?
Thank you for pointing me in the right direction,

Good morning Avneesh,
Unfortunately, it has been one week and I have not received any response from Nitin or Pawan, despite three
separate requests. I have found that Nitin reports to Pawan, and reports to Shruthi Ketepalle, but I would prefer not to
have to escalate in order to receive a response. Are you on speaking terms with either of these individuals? Do you
have another contact at GlobalLogic that may be more responsive?
Thank you for your suggestions,

This transition took place over a month ago now. I have since received another promotion, however it was explained
to all of us that the transition from Curator to Reviewer does not come with a salary increase. They also openly stated
the rate of all of the Python Reviewers, of $28/hr.
So, I join the Writing team at $21/hr., After 1 month of training, I transitioned to the Python team, which consists of at
least 60 individuals, all of which making at least $28/hr. While I found online some individuals in this position could be
receiving rates of at least $36/hr, $28/hr would at least be a start of equitable compensation, my excellent
performance notwithstanding.
After 1 month of time on this new team, I am selected and promoted from Curator to Reviewer, which is evidence of
my continued excellence and performance. Yet, I am potentially the lowest paid member on the team? I too have a
family which counts on my financial success for their well-being, and right now I feel like I am doing my best and
outperforming my peers, and the company which I am doing it for can't have a conversation on my behalf? Even if the
decision is no, at least the process took place. I would have heard the review of the situation and accepted the

resulting decision. But this has not happened.
Is there not an existing process or line of communication for situations like this where an individual performs admirably
and is promoted twice now in two months?
I apologize for my insistence on this matter, but I wish to at least begin the process of reviewing this matter, it's been a
month and no conversation has even taken place.
Please advise,

Good morning Darren and happy Friday,
I wanted to know if you have made any progress on ascertaining concrete figures for the compensation rates from
those listed above?
Additionally, I was first moved from the Content Writing team which is paid $21/hr to the Python team writing code at
$28/hr on May 7. Would it be possible to consider back pay for the time period involved to determine this pay
discrepancy?
Thank you for your time looking into this matter,

Hey David, 
The pay levels in our business unit are associated with the position. The current position you're aligned to isn't
associated with a pay change. Our business unit has pay levels associated with Task, Pod, PO, and PAO leads.
Although the project allows opportunities of growth on the project, not all positions are associated with a paychange or
conversion. This is the guidance shared to me about the project.

I understand that, however I have been "promoted" to a different Team that requires additional skill sets that performs
different Tasks for different POs and PAOs than the Team that I was originally assigned. This is what I am attempting
to point out as the issue here. What Tasks/PO/PAO do you currently have me under?

Hey David, When one moves over to an editor, reviewer, sr editor, or sr reviewer, it's not associated as a promotion on
the project. It's more of an opportunity of growth or transition on the project. On our project promotions are in the
following positions as I mentioned. Our business unit does not view individual tracks as promotions because it's in the
level as the superater. 
Your project leads should be able to explain further what's associated as a promotion.

You might be confusing the two, I'm not referring to my promotion from Curator to Reviewer, nor my Reviewer to Sr.
Reviewer promotion. I am referring to my Content Writer to Junior Python Developer promotion, which is not one of
the project promotions that you mentioned. What Tasks/PO/PAO do you currently have me under?

Here is another way I can explain it. We were told clearly in onboarding what to put and what not to put on our
LinkedIn profile. We were told to put what was on our contract for our job title, mine is Content Writer. Everyone on the
python team, on their contract, it says Junior Python Developer. They are allowed to put an accurate description of
what they are doing on their LinkedIn profile, and I am not.

Good Morning Shruthi,
I apologize for reaching out to you directly, but at this point I do not know who else to turn to.
48 days ago, on May 7, 2024 I was promoted from Content Writer to Junior Python Developer. The reason why I was
selected for this promotion was because the current new Python hires were capable on the coding side of the job, but
struggled with the English writing skills that are also required. Coming from the Content Writing side, I could bring the
English writing skills. I met with the Training Manager, Cassandra Ford, who agreed that I also had enough coding
skills to meet the requirements of the Junior Python Developer team.
The salary for the Content Writer position is $21/hr. The salary for the Junior Python Developer position starts at $28/
hr. This is a 33% difference and would make a significant difference to myself and my family.
Since that time, I have been attempting to seek a review of this situation in order to receive an equitable increase in
compensation. 
I then alerted Avneesh Shukla, my contact at Cynet Systems who after 29 days was able to furnish two contacts at
Global Logic: Pawan Mishra and Nitin Srivastava.
It has since been another 19 days, and the only response I have had from Pawan and/or Nitin is that they would
contact someone and get back to me.
I have sent numerous requests to all three individuals mentioned and have yet to initiate any sort of process that could
bring a resolution to this matter.
As I mentioned to Pawan, Nitin and Avneesh on June 12, I was promoted again due to my strong performance on
task:
After 1 month of time on this new team, I am selected and promoted from Curator to Reviewer, which is evidence of
my continued excellence and performance. Yet, I am potentially the lowest paid member on the team? I too have a
family which counts on my financial success for their well-being, and right now I feel like I am doing my best and
outperforming my peers, and the company which I am doing it for can't have a conversation on my behalf? Even if the
decision is no, at least the process took place. I would have heard the review of the situation and accepted the
resulting decision. But this has not happened.
I wish to at least begin the process of reviewing this matter, it's been almost two months and no conversation has
even taken place.
Please advise, 
David Gerabagi

Good morning Shruthi,
Has there been any progress on this request?
I have since been promoted again and am now a Senior Reviewer. This is my third promotion in as many months. I
was also asked to deliver Prompt Engineering training to my colleagues. All of this speaks to my performance and
capabilities.
My performance notwithstanding, everyone else on the Python team is getting paid at least $28/hr and I am still
getting paid only $21/hr. This brings up an additional question, will I receive back pay from when I was first transferred
to the Python team?
Thanks,

Confirmation of PO/PAO

To: Sara Stewart <sara.stewart@globallogic.com>
Hi Sara,
So when Darren said how they determine pay rates, he said they go off by three things, the PO, PAO, and the Tasks
being assigned.
After being hired, during training, I transitioned from one team to another. Below is the Hierarchy for my current team,
which displays the PO, PAO, and Task Leads. I am listed as a Review (I've since been promoted to Sr. Reviewer, but
the PO and PAO have remained the same).
This image shows:
My PO as: Cassandra Ford
My PAO as: Lydia Yampolsky
If you can confirm from Darren that these are the same PO and PAO that he has me listed under that determines the
pay, then that's that. I'll have gotten the confirmation I was seeking.

Rate & New Evidence Regarding GlobalLogic Account

dgerabagi@gmail.com <dgerabagi@gmail.com>Fri, May 16, 2025 at 12:17 PM
To: Cynet HR <hr@cynetsystems.com>
Good afternoon,
I am writing to follow up on our email correspondence from approximately one year ago (May/June 2024) 
regarding the significant change in my role on the GlobalLogic account (for Google) from Content Writer 
to Junior Python Developer. As you'll recall, this transfer, initiated by the client due to a need for Python 
and advanced analytical skills, involved a substantial increase in responsibility, complexity, and expected 
output, which I detailed at the time.
Unfortunately, the critical issue of adjusting my compensation to reflect this more demanding and skilled 
role was never resolved. I recall that after some discussion, Cynet's guidance was for me to personally 
reach out to GlobalLogic HR (Pawan Mishra and Nitin Srivastava) to advocate for my own pay 
adjustment. This was, and remains, a concern. As Cynet is my direct employer, I firmly believe it is 
Cynet's responsibility to manage contractual terms, including fair compensation for assigned roles, with 
the client, GlobalLogic, on behalf of its employees.
I am compelled to revisit this now, armed with two significant pieces of evidence:
1. The "GlobalLogic Pay Parity Letter" (
link) from the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA (attached, 
and publicly available), which details systemic pay disparities at GlobalLogic.
2. The Google Supplier Code of Conduct (
link) updated March 2025, a copy of which I have now 
obtained (and attach for your immediate review). This Code outlines clear expectations for all 
Google suppliers, including GlobalLogic, and by extension, their staffing partners like Cynet.
The Google Supplier Code of Conduct is particularly illuminating. It states that Google expects its 
commitments to be upheld by "its suppliers, vendors, staffing partners, contractors, subcontractors, and 
sub-tier suppliers" and that "Suppliers will also require their own suppliers, vendors, and contractors to 
comply with the Code in their operations and across their supply chains" (Page 2).
Several sections of this Code are directly applicable to my situation and raise serious questions about 
GlobalLogic's practices, which in turn impact Cynet:
• Section 2.3 Wages and benefits (Page 5-6): This section is crucial. It mandates that "Suppliers 
will ensure equal payment to all workers for work of equal or comparable value.
" My transition 
to a Junior Python Developer role represented a clear move to work of significantly higher 
complexity and value compared to my previous Content Writing role, yet my compensation did not 
reflect this. This is a direct contradiction to Google's stated expectations for its suppliers.
• Section 2.3 also states: "Suppliers will provide workers with timely and understandable pay stubs 
or equivalent documentation that explains the basis of their compensation." The lack of adjustment 
Gmail - Re: Fwd: Client Moved Me to a New Team - URGENT Follow-...https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=671c6dcf72&view=pt&search=al...
1 of 56/6/2025, 9:48 AM

and clarity around my pay following the role change also falls short here.
• Section 2.5 Fair treatment and non-discrimination (Page 6): This section stipulates, "Suppliers 
will not discriminate in... employment practices, including wages, promotions, rewards..." Failure 
to adjust wages commensurate with a significant increase in role responsibilities and value can be 
seen as a discriminatory practice against the principles of fair reward for work performed.
• Section 2 (General, Page 3): The Code clearly states its principles apply to "all workers, including 
temporary, migrant, student, contract, and direct employees." 
This unequivocally includes 
contractors like myself.
GlobalLogic's failure to ensure my pay reflects the value of my Python Developer role not only 
contravenes the spirit and letter of Google's Supplier Code of Conduct but also puts Cynet in a difficult 
position. If GlobalLogic is systematically undervaluing roles and underpaying, it means Cynet is likely 
being significantly short-changed, as your revenue is tied to our billing rates. Furthermore, it potentially 
prevents Cynet from upholding the standards Google expects for all workers on its projects, even those 
employed via staffing partners.
The collective financial loss for Cynet across all contractors on the GlobalLogic project could be 
substantial if this pattern of underpayment, and non-adherence to Google's Supplier Code of Conduct, is 
as widespread as the AWU letter and my own experience suggest.
Therefore, I reiterate and strengthen my requests:
1. Immediate Review and Rectification of My Compensation: I formally request that Cynet take 
immediate action to adjust my pay rate to accurately reflect my responsibilities and contributions 
as a Junior Python Developer, retroactive to my role change on May 7, 2024. This is not just a 
matter of fairness but of compliance with the standards set by Google for its suppliers.
2. Cynet-led Engagement with GlobalLogic: I strongly urge Cynet to use the combined evidence 
of the AWU letter and the Google Supplier Code of Conduct to engage GlobalLogic directly. This 
engagement should address my specific case and also serve as a comprehensive review of billing 
rates and payment structures for all Cynet contractors on the GlobalLogic account to ensure 
compliance with Google's Code and protect Cynet's financial interests.
I believe that by Cynet proactively addressing these issues with GlobalLogic, supported by this clear 
documentation from Google itself, we can ensure fair compensation and uphold the ethical standards 
expected on this project.
I look forward to your prompt response and a detailed plan of action.
Sincerely,
David Gerabagi

Good afternoon,
I am writing to follow up on my email sent on May 16, 2025 (see below/attached), regarding my 
unresolved pay rate adjustment from May/June 2024 and the significant new evidence I provided – 
namely the "GlobalLogic Pay Parity Letter" from the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA and the Google 
Supplier Code of Conduct.
Given the serious nature of these documents, particularly their implications for Cynet's financial interests 
and its obligations under Google's supplier standards, I was hoping to have received at least an 
acknowledgment of receipt or an initial response by now.
To further underscore the direct relevance of the AWU letter, I want to explicitly clarify a point I may not 
have made clear previously: I am a Super Rater and part of the very Rater/Super Rater teams at 
GlobalLogic represented by that open letter. The issues of pay disparity and unfair compensation 
detailed within it are a direct reflection of the environment and challenges my colleagues and I have 
been facing. My personal situation from May/June 2024, where my role changed to Junior Python 
Developer without a corresponding and appropriate pay adjustment, is a concrete example of the 
systemic issues highlighted by my team in that letter.
This isn't just external evidence; it's a documented outcry from the team I belong to, validating the very 
concerns I raised with Cynet a year ago.
Considering:
1. The long-standing nature of my unresolved pay issue (since May 2024).
2. The clear directives within the Google Supplier Code of Conduct (Section 2.3: "equal payment 
to all workers for work of equal or comparable value").
3. The supporting evidence from the AWU-CWA letter, authored by my own team, highlighting 
systemic pay disparities.
4. The potential financial impact on Cynet due to GlobalLogic's practices.
5. The previous instance where Cynet directed me to resolve this with GlobalLogic HR, which I 
maintain is Cynet's responsibility as my employer.
I must insist on a timely and substantive response. Could you please provide an update on:
• When Cynet will be formally reviewing my specific pay rate, retroactive to May 7, 2024?
• What steps Cynet is taking to investigate GlobalLogic's compensation practices across all Cynet 
contractors on this account, in light of the Google Supplier Code of Conduct and the AWU letter?
Sincerely,
David Gerabagi

Dear Ms. Graham,
I am in receipt of your email dated July 30, 2025.
Your response is factually incorrect and constitutes a definitive failure to engage with this matter in good faith.
The assertion that "there have been no changes to [my] responsibilities" and that I "continue to work as a Content
Writer" is demonstrably false. It is directly contradicted by the extensive evidence already in your possession,
documenting my transfer to the Python team and assumption of developer duties, effective May 7, 2024.
Furthermore, your response completely ignores the central findings of the "Evidentiary Analysis of Systemic Labor,
Compliance, and National Security Risks" submitted on June 23, 2025. You have willfully failed to address the core
systemic issues:
1.  Systemic labor misclassification;
2.  Breaches of the Google Supplier Code of Conduct; and
3.  Critical national security vulnerabilities created by this fissured employment model.
Your attempt to minimize these systemic liabilities into an individual HR dispute is unacceptable. Moreover, your
reliance on a confirmation from your client (GlobalLogic) to deny documented reality confirms for the record that both
Cynet Systems and GlobalLogic are now knowingly participating in a strategy of misrepresentation.

This is no longer a matter for HR review. Given this documented bad-faith engagement, I am immediately transmitting
the complete evidentiary file, including this correspondence, to the legal counsel of the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA.
We are evaluating all available remedies, including the filing of Unfair Labor Practice charges with the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) against both Cynet Systems and GlobalLogic.
This communication serves as a final professional courtesy. Should Cynet's executive leadership and legal counsel
wish to discuss an immediate and comprehensive resolution before formal actions commence, they must contact me
by EOB Thursday, August 7, 2025.
Respectfully,
David Gerabagi

(with the right to sublicense) to make, have made, modify, use, sell, offer to sell, import, reproduce, 
distribute, publish, prepare derivative works 
of, display, and perform publicly and by means of digital audio transmission such Invention 
as  part of  or  in connection with such product, process or machine. 
(b) Assignment  of  Inventions:  I  agree  that  I  will  promptly  make  full  written  disclosure  to  the  
Company, will hold in trust for the sole right and benefit of the Company, and hereby assign to the 
Company,  or  its    designee,  all m y  right,  title  and interest throughout the world in and to any 
Inventions as defined in Section 4(a) which I may solely or jointly conceive or develop or reduce 
to practice, or cause to be conceived or developed or reduced to practice, during the term of my 
Provision of Services, whether during working hours or otherwise. I further acknowledge that all 
Inventions  which  are  original  works  of  authorship  or  otherwise  constitute  copyrightable  subject  
matter are "works made for hire" within the meaning of the United States Copyright Act and any 
similar  laws  of   other  jurisdictions  (to  the  greatest  extent  permitted  by  applicable  law)  and  are  
compensated by my compensation. 
(c) Maintenance  of  Records:  I  agree  to  keep  and  maintain  adequate  and  current  written  
records of all Inventions made by me (solely or jointly with others) during the term of my Provision 
of  Services  with  the  Company.  The  records  may  be  in  the  form  of  notes,  sketches,  drawings,  
flow charts, electronic data or recordings, laboratory notebooks, and/or any other suitable format. 
The records will be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times. I agree 
not to remove such records from the Company’s place of business except as expressly permitted 
by Company policy which may, from time to time, be revised at the sole election of the Company 
for the purpose of furthering the Company’s business. 
(d) Assistance: I    agree to assist the Company, or its   designee, at the Company’s expense, in 
every proper way to secure the Company’s rights in the Inventions and any copyrights, 
patents,  trademarks,  mask  work  rights,  moral  rights,  or  other  intellectual  property  rights  
relating thereto in any and all countries, including the disclosure to the Company of all pertinent 
information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications,  oaths, 
assignments, recordations, and all other instruments which the Company shall deem necessary 
in order to apply for, obtain, maintain and transfer such rights and in order to assign and convey 
to  the  Company,  its  successors,  assigns  and  nominees  the  sole  and  exclusive right,  title  and 
interest

in  and  to  such  Inventions,  and  any  copyrights,  trademarks,  patents,  mask  work  rights  or  other  
intellectual property rights relating thereto. I further agree that m y    obligation to execute or cause 
to be executed, when it is in my power to do so, any such instrument or papers shall continue after 
the termination of this Agreement until the expiration of the last such intellectual property right to 
expire  in  any  country  of  the  world.  If  the  Company  is  unable  because  of  my  mental  or  physical 
incapacity or unavailability or for any other reason to secure my signature to apply for or to pursue 
any  application  for  any  United  States  or  foreign  patents  or  mask  work,  trademark  or  copyright  
registrations  covering  Inventions  assigned  to  the  Company  as  above,  then  I  hereby  irrevocably 
designate and appoint the Company and its   duly authorized officers and agents 
as my  agent  and attorney  in fact,  to act for and in my behalf   and stead   to execute and file 
any  such applications  and  to  do all other  lawfully  permitted acts  to  further  the application 
for,  prosecution,  issuance,  maintenance  or  transfer  of  patents  and  copyright,  trademark  and  
mask work registrations with the same legal force and effect as if originally executed by me. I 
hereby  waive  and  irrevocably  quitclaim  to  the  Company  any  and  all  claims,  of  any  nature 
whatsoever, which I   may now or hereafter have for infringement of any and all proprietary rights 
assigned to the Company. 
6.   Returning Company Documents: I agree that, at the time of termination/completion of my 
Provision of Services with the Company, I will deliver to the Company (and will not keep in m y 
possession, recreate or deliver to anyone else) any and all    devices, records, data, notes, reports, 
proposals,   lists,   correspondence,   specifications,   drawings,   blueprints,   sketches,   laboratory   
notebooks,  materials,  flow  charts,  equipment,  other  documents  or  property,  or  reproductions  of  
any aforementioned items developed by me pursuant to m y Provision of Services or otherwise 
belonging to the Company, its  successors or assigns. I   further agree that any property situated 
on  the  Company’s  premises  and  owned  by  the  Company,  including  disks  and  other  storage  
media, filing cabinets or other work areas, is subject to inspection by Company personnel at any 
time with or without notice. 
7.   No  Restrictions:  I  represent  and  warrant  to  the  Company  that  there  are  no  restrictions,  
agreements or understandings to which I am bound which would limit my right to enter into and 
perform this Agreement, to be placed with the Company or to perform my duties. I represent and 
warrant that all information that I have furnished and that I will furnish to the Company in connection 
with my Provision of Services with the Company is or will be true and complete and that I have 
disclosed  to  the  Company  all  restraints,  confidentiality  commitments  or  other  employment 
restrictions that I   have with any other person or entity. 
 
8.   Compliance  with  Company  Policies:  During  the  term  of  my  Provision  of  Services,  I  will  
comply with all lawful policies, practices and procedures established and any Company policies 
that may be communicated to me at any time by the Company. 
9.   At-W  ill  Provision  of  Services:  I  UNDERSTAND  AND  ACKNOWLEDGE  THAT  MY  
CONSULTING  AGREEMENT  WITH  THE  COMPANY  IS  "AT-WILL"  AND  THAT  THIS  
AGREEMENT IS NOT A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR A PROMISE OF CONTINUED 
PROVISION  OF SERVICES FOR ANY SPECIFIED  PERIOD. 
10. Survival  of  Provisions:  Amendment;  Assignment:  My  obligations  as  set  forth  in  this  
Agreement  will  survive  the  termination  of  my  Agreement  with  the  Company  whether  or  not  the  
Agreement   is   terminated   for   cause or   at-will.   None of   the provisions   contained in   this 
Agreement can be changed without a writing signed by me and the Company. 
11. Equitable Relief: Attorney’s Fees: Extension of Period: If I breach or threaten to breach 
any provision of this Agreement, the Company will be entitled, as a matter of right, to injunctive 

Corporate Headquarters 
2535 Augustine Dr. 5th Floor Santa Clara, CA 95054      
P: +1-408-273-8900 W: GlobalLogic.com 
 
relief,  including specific performance, with respect  to any such breach or threatened breach. If 
the Company prevails in any action or proceeding brought to enforce this Agreement, then the 
Company  will  be  entitled  to  recover  from  me  all  reasonable  attorneys’  fees,  cost  and 
disbursements  incurred  by  the  Company  in  connection  with  such  action  or  proceeding.  The  
Company’s rights and remedies under this Section 14 are in addition to and cumulative with any 
other rights and remedies to which the Company may be entitled. 
12. Severability:  I  acknowledge  that  the  obligations  and  restrictions  contained  in  this  
Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of  the Company and 
that the Company would not have hired me or granted any options to me in the  absence of such 
obligations and restrictions. Each provision in this Agreement is an independent provision and the 
enforceability of anyone provision will not affect the enforceability of any other provision. However, 
if any particular provision of this Agreement is determined by a court to be excessively broad as 
to duration, geographic scope, activity or subject  to be enforceable, then that provision  will  be  
deemed amended by limiting and reducing it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum 
extent compatible with the laws of such jurisdiction. 
13. No  W  aiver  of  Rights:  Any  waiver  by  the  Company  of  any  power  or  right  under  this  
Agreement must be in writing and signed by the Company to be enforceable. Any waiver by the 
Company will not operate as a    waiver of any other or future breach under this 
Agreement. 
 
14. Binding Obligation: This Agreement will be binding upon me and my heirs, executors and 
administrators and will inure to the benefit of the Company and its   successors and assigns. 
 
15. Governing Law;  Choice  of  Forum    and Venue:   This    Agreement      will  be governed 
and construed as  to  its    validity,  interpretation and effect  by  the laws  of  the State  of Delaware 
notwithstanding the choice of law rules of Delaware or any other jurisdiction. 
I  ALSO  HEREBY  IRREVOCABLY  AND  UNCONDITIONALLY  CONSENT  TO  THE  
EXCLUSIVE  JURISDICTION  AND  VENUE  OF  THE  STATE  AND  FEDERAL  COURTS  
LOCATED  IN  WILMINGTON, DELAWARE IN  W HICH THE COMPANY  MAINTAINS  ITS 
PRINCIPAL  OFFICE. However, I acknowledge that
 the      Company may seek enforcement 
of this Agreement in any appropriate court and in any jurisdiction where I am subject to personal 
jurisdiction and where venue is proper. 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I   have signed this Agreement as of the date written below.

Code of Conduct 
Preface 
 
The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Google’s values into practice. It’s built around the 
recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be, and should be, measured 
against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct. We set the bar that high for practical as 
well as aspirational reasons: Our commitment to the highest standards helps us hire great people, build great 
products, and attract loyal users. Respect for our users, for the opportunity, and for each other are 
foundational to our success, and ​are something we need to support every day. 
So please do read the Code and Google’s values, and follow both in spirit and letter, always bearing in mind 
that each of us has a personal responsibility to incorporate, and to encourage other Googlers to incorporate, 
the principles of the Code and values into our work. And if you have a question or ever think that one of your 
fellow Googlers or the company as a whole may be falling short of our commitment, don’t be silent. We want 
– and need – to hear from you. 
Who Must Follow Our Code? 
We expect all of our employees and Board members to know and follow the Code. Failure to do so can result 
in disciplinary action, including termination of employment. Moreover, while the Code is specifically written 
for Google employees and Board members, we expect Google contractors, consultants, and others who may 
be temporarily assigned to perform work or services for Google to follow the Code in connection with their 
work for us. Failure of a Google contractor, consultant, or other covered service provider to follow the Code 
can result in termination of their relationship with Google. 
What If I Have a Code-Related Question or Concern? 
If you have a question or concern, don’t just sit there. You can contact your manager, your Human Resources 
representative, or Ethics & Compliance. You can also submit a question or raise a concern of a suspected 
violation of our Code or any other Google policy through the Ethics & Compliance Helpline. Finally, if you 
believe a violation of law has occurred, you can always raise that through the Ethics & Compliance helpline or 
with a government agency. 
No Retaliation 
Google prohibits retaliation against any worker here at Google who reports or participates in an investigation 
of a possible violation of our Code, policies, or the law. If you believe you are being retaliated against, please 
contact Ethics & Compliance. 
I. Serve Our Users 
Our users value Google not only because we deliver great products and services, but because we hold 
ourselves to a higher standard in how we treat users and operate more generally. Keeping the following 
principles in mind will help us to maintain that high standard: 
June 2019 version 
1 

Integrity 
Our reputation as a company that our users can trust is our most valuable asset, and it is up to all of us to 
make sure that we continually earn that trust. All of our communications and other interactions with our 
users should increase their trust in us. 
Usefulness 
Our products, features, and services should make Google more useful for all our users. We have many 
different types of users, from individuals to large businesses, but one guiding principle: “Is what we are 
offering useful?” 
Privacy, Security, and Freedom of Expression 
Always remember that we are asking users to trust us with their personal information. Preserving that trust 
requires that each of us respect and protect the privacy and security of that information. Our security 
procedures strictly limit access to and use of users’ personal information, and require that each of us take 
measures to protect user data from unauthorized access. Know your responsibilities under these 
procedures, and collect, use, and access user personal information only as authorized by our ​Security 
Policies​, our ​Privacy Policies​, and applicable data protection laws. 
Google is committed to advancing privacy and freedom of expression for our users around the world. Where 
user privacy and freedom of expression face government challenges, we seek to implement internationally 
recognized standards that respect those rights as we develop products, do business in diverse markets, and 
respond to government requests to access user information or remove user content. Contact Legal or Ethics 
& Compliance if you have questions on implementing these standards in connection with what you do at 
Google. 
Responsiveness 
Part of being useful and honest is being responsive: We recognize relevant user feedback when we see it, 
and we do something about it. We take pride in responding to communications from our users, whether 
questions, problems, or compliments. If something is broken, fix it. 
Take Action 
Any time you feel our users aren’t being well-served, don’t be bashful - let someone in the company know 
about it. Continually improving our products and services takes all of us, and we’re proud that Googlers 
champion our users and take the initiative to step forward when the interests of our users are at stake. 
II. Support Each Other 
We are committed to a supportive work environment, where employees have the opportunity to reach their 
fullest potential. Googlers are expected to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of 
harassment, intimidation, bias, and unlawful discrimination. 
Please read the ​Employee Handbook​ relevant to your locale. Located in the HR section of our internal 
corporate site, the Handbook covers in greater detail how we should conduct ourselves at work. 
June 2019 version 
2 

Equal Opportunity Employment 
Employment here​ is based solely upon individual merit and qualifications directly related to professional 
competence. We strictly prohibit unlawful discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, 
veteran status, national origin, ancestry, pregnancy status, sex, gender identity or expression, age, marital 
status, mental or physical disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, or any other characteristics 
protected by law. We also make all reasonable accommodations to meet our obligations under laws 
protecting the rights of the disabled. 
Harassment, Discrimination, and Bullying 
Google prohibits discrimination, harassment and bullying in any form – verbal, physical, or visual, as 
discussed more fully in our Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation. If you believe you’ve 
been bullied or harassed by anyone at Google, or by a Google partner or vendor, we strongly encourage you 
to immediately report the incident to your supervisor, ​Human Resources​ or both. Similarly, supervisors and 
managers who learn of any such incident should immediately report it to ​Human Resources​. HR will promptly 
and thoroughly investigate any complaints and take appropriate action. 
Drugs and Alcohol 
Our ​position on substance abuse​ is simple: It is incompatible with the health and safety of our employees, 
and we don’t permit it. Consumption of alcohol is not banned at our offices, but use good judgment and 
never drink in a way that leads to impaired performance or inappropriate behavior, endangers the safety of 
others, or violates the law. Illegal drugs in our offices or at sponsored events are strictly prohibited. If a 
manager has reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee’s use of drugs and/or alcohol may adversely 
affect the employee’s job performance or the safety of the employee or others in the workplace, the manager 
may request an alcohol and/or drug screening. A reasonable suspicion may be based on objective 
symptoms such as the employee’s appearance, behavior, or speech. 
Safe Workplace 
We are ​committed to a violence-free work environment​, and we will not tolerate any level of violence or the 
threat of violence in the workplace. Under no circumstances should anyone bring a weapon to work. If you 
become aware of a violation of this policy, you should report it to ​Human Resources​ immediately. In case of 
potential violence, contact Google Security. 
Dog Policy 
Google’s affection for our canine friends is an integral facet of our corporate culture. We like cats, but we’re a 
dog company, so as a general rule we feel cats visiting our offices would be fairly stressed out. However, 
before bringing your canine companion to the office, please make sure you review our​ ​Dog Policy 
III. Avoid Conflicts of Interest 
When you are in a situation in which competing loyalties could cause you to pursue a personal benefit for 
you, your friends, or your family at the expense of Google or our users, you may be faced with a conflict of 
interest. All of us should avoid conflicts of interest and circumstances that reasonably present the 
appearance of a conflict. 
June 2019 version 
3 

When considering a course of action, ask yourself whether the action you’re considering could create an 
incentive for you, or appear to others to create an incentive for you, to benefit yourself, your friends or family, 
or an associated business at the expense of Google.If the answer is “yes,” the action you’re considering is 
likely to create a conflict of interest situation, and you should avoid it. 
Below, we provide guidance in seven areas where conflicts of interest often arise: 
●Personal investments 
●Outside employment, advisory roles, board seats, and starting your own business 
●Business opportunities found through work 
●Inventions 
●Friends and relatives; co-worker relationships 
●Accepting gifts, entertainment, and other business courtesies 
●Use of Google products and services 
In each of these situations, the rule is the same – if you are considering entering into a business situation 
that creates a conflict of interest, don’t. If you are in a business situation that may create a conflict of 
interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest, review the situation with your manager and Ethics & 
Compliance. Finally, it’s important to understand that as circumstances change, a situation that previously 
didn’t present a conflict of interest may present one. 
Personal Investments 
Avoid making ​personal investments​ in companies that are Google competitors or business partners when 
the investment might cause, or appear to cause, you to act in a way that could harm Google. 
When determining whether a personal investment creates a conflict of interest, consider the relationship 
between the business of the outside company, Google’s business, and what you do at Google, including 
whether the company has a business relationship with Google that you can influence, and the extent to which 
the company competes with Google. You should also consider 1) any overlap between your specific role at 
Google and the company’s business, 2) the significance of the investment, including the size of the 
investment in relation to your net worth, 3) whether the investment is in a public or private company, 4) your 
ownership percentage of the company, and 5) the extent to which the investment gives you the ability to 
manage and control the company. 
Investments in venture capital or other similar funds that invest in a broad cross-section of companies that 
may include Google competitors or business partners generally do not create conflicts of interest. However, 
a conflict of interest may exist if you control the fund’s investment activity. 
Outside Employment, Advisory Roles, Board Seats, and Starting Your 
Own Business 
Avoid accepting employment, advisory positions, or board seats with Google competitors or business 
partners​ when your judgment could be, or could appear to be, influenced in a way that could harm Google. 
Additionally, because board seats come with fiduciary obligations that can make them particularly tricky 
from a conflict of interest perspective, you should notify your manager before accepting a board seat with 
any outside company. Google board members and employees who are VP and above should also notify 
Ethics & Compliance. Finally, do not start your own business if it will compete with Google. 
Business Opportunities Found Through Work 
June 2019 version 
4 

Business opportunities discovered through your work here belong first to Google, except as otherwise agreed 
to by Google. 
Inventions 
Developing or helping to develop outside ​inventions​ that a) relate to Google’s existing or reasonably 
anticipated products and services, b) relate to your position at Google, or c) are developed using Google 
corporate resources may create conflicts of interest and be subject to the provisions of Google’s 
Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement and other employment agreements. If you 
have any questions about potential conflicts or intellectual property ownership involving an outside invention 
or other intellectual property, consult Ethics & Compliance or Legal. 
Friends and Relatives; Co-Worker Relationships 
Avoid participating in management of or decision-making regarding potential or existing Google business 
relationships that involve your relatives, spouse or significant other, or close friends. This includes being the 
hiring manager for a position for which your relative or close friend is being considered or being a 
relationship manager for a company associated with your spouse or significant other. 
To be clear, just because a relative, spouse/significant other, or close friend works at Google or becomes a 
Google competitor or business partner doesn’t mean there is a conflict of interest. However, if you are also 
involved in that Google business relationship, it can be very sensitive. The right thing to do in that situation is 
to discuss the relationship with your manager and Ethics & Compliance. 
Finally, ​romantic relationships between co-workers​ can, depending on the work roles and respective 
positions of the co-workers involved, create an actual or apparent conflict of interest. If a romantic 
relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict, it may require changes to work arrangements or even 
the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved. Consult Google’s ​Employee Handbook 
for additional guidance on this issue. 
Accepting Gifts, Entertainment, and Other Business Courtesies 
Accepting gifts, entertainment, and other business courtesies from a Google competitor or business partner 
can easily create the appearance of a conflict of interest, especially if the value of the item is significant. 
Google’s ​Non-Government Related Gifts & Client Entertainment Policy​ provides specific guidance on when it 
is appropriate for Googlers to accept gifts, entertainment, or any other business courtesy (including 
discounts or benefits that are not made available to all Googlers) from any of our competitors or business 
partners. 
Generally, acceptance of inexpensive “token” non-cash gifts is permissible. In addition, infrequent and 
moderate business meals and entertainment with clients and infrequent invitations to attend local sporting 
events and celebratory meals with clients can be appropriate aspects of many Google business 
relationships, provided that they aren’t excessive and don’t create the appearance of impropriety. Before 
accepting any gift or courtesy, consult the ​Non-Government Related Gifts & Client Entertainment Policy​, and 
be aware that you may need to obtain manager approval. 
Contact Ethics & Compliance if you have any questions. See the discussion of Anti-Bribery Laws in Section 
VII(d) for guidance on when it is appropriate to give gifts and business courtesies in the course of doing 
Google business. 
Use of Google Products and Services 
June 2019 version 
5 

Avoiding potential conflicts of interest also means that you should not use Google products, services, 
internal tools, or information in a way that improperly benefits you or someone you know or creates the 
appearance that you have an unfair advantage over users outside of Google. For example, you should never 
approve Google accounts, services, or credits for yourself, your friends, or family members. Similarly, you 
should not use the tools, information, or access that you have as a Googler to participate in or to generate a 
financial benefit for yourself or others from invalid ad traffic (IVT) on Google products, such as generating 
IVT, purchasing or selling IVT (except for the purposes of company sanctioned research), or linking to (or 
appearing to link to) business partners that may be engaging in IVT. If you find yourself subject to a conflict 
of interest regarding the use of Google’s products, services, tools, or information, discuss the situation with 
your manager, Legal, or Ethics & Compliance 
Reporting 
Ethics & Compliance will periodically report to the Google Compliance Steering Committee all matters 
involving Google officers – VPs and above – approved under this section of the Code, and will periodically 
report to the Google Audit Committee all matters involving Google executive officers and Board members 
approved under this section. 
IV. Preserve Confidentiality 
We get a lot of press attention around our innovations and our culture, and that’s usually fine. However, 
certain kinds of company information, if leaked prematurely into the press or to competitors, can hurt our 
product launches, eliminate our competitive advantage and prove costly in other ways. Our responsibilities 
extend beyond not revealing Confidential Google material – we must also: 
●properly secure, label, and (when appropriate) dispose of Confidential Google material;  
●safeguard Confidential information that Google receives from others under non-disclosure 
agreements; 
●take steps to keep our trade secrets and other confidential intellectual property secret. 
Confidential Information 
Make sure that information that is classified as “Need to Know” or “Confidential” in Google’s Data 
Classification Guidelines is handled in accordance with those Guidelines and Google’s Data Security Policy. 
At times, a particular project or negotiation may require you to disclose Need to Know or Confidential 
information to an outside party: Disclosure of that information should be on an “only as needed”  basis and 
only under a non-disclosure agreement. In addition, Google policy may require a prior security assessment of 
the outside party that is to receive the confidential information. Be sure to conduct the appropriate due 
diligence and have the appropriate agreement in place before you disclose the information. 
There are, of course, “gray areas” in which you will need to apply your best judgment in making sure you don’t 
disclose any confidential information. Suppose a friend who works at a non-profit organization asks you 
informally how to improve the Google search ranking of the group’s website: Giving your friend 
site-optimization tips available in public articles and on websites isn’t likely to be a problem, but giving tips 
that aren’t publicly known definitely would be. If you’re in a gray area, be cautious in what advice or insight 
you provide or, better yet, ask for guidance from Ethics & Compliance. 
And don’t forget about ​pictures​ you and your guests take at Google – it is up to you to be sure that those 
pictures don’t disclose confidential information. 
Finally, some of us will find ourselves having family or other personal relationships with people employed by 
our competitors or business partners. As in most cases, common sense applies. Don’t tell your significant 
June 2019 version 
6 

other or family members anything confidential, and don’t solicit confidential information from them about 
their company. 
Google Partners 
Just as you are careful not to disclose confidential Google information, it’s equally important not to disclose 
any confidential information from our partners. Don’t accept confidential information from other companies 
without first having all parties sign an appropriate ​Non-disclosure Agreement​ approved by Legal. Even after 
the agreement is signed, try only to accept as much information as you need to accomplish your business 
objectives. 
Alphabet and “Other Bet” data 
Be sure to protect confidential information of Alphabet or of any Alphabet or Google subsidiary or affiliate 
(“Alphabet companies”). You may have access to confidential information through collaborations, rotations, 
20% projects with another Alphabet company, access to Alphabet buildings or networks, or simply through 
casual interactions. Don’t  access or use confidential information of other Alphabet companies except when 
authorized and reasonably necessary for valid business purposes within the scope of your work at Google. 
Take all reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of any such information just as you would for 
Google confidential information. 
 
Don’t disclose any confidential information about any Alphabet company, including financial, partner, 
business, technical, or IP information, before obtaining appropriate sign-off from Legal, which may include 
getting consent from affected Alphabet companies. 
Competitors/Former Employers 
We respect our competitors and want to compete with them fairly. But we don’t want their confidential 
information. The same goes for confidential information belonging to any Googler’s former employers. If an 
opportunity arises to take advantage of a competitor’s or former employer’s confidential information, don’t 
do it. Should you happen to come into possession of a competitor’s confidential information, contact Legal 
immediately. 
Outside Communications  
You probably know that our policy is to be extremely careful about disclosing confidential proprietary 
information. Consistent with that, you should also ensure your outside communications (including online and 
social media posts) do not disclose confidential proprietary information or represent (or otherwise give the 
impression) that you are speaking on behalf of Google unless you’re authorized to do so by the company. 
The same applies to communications with the press. Finally, check with your manager and Corporate 
Communications before accepting any public speaking engagement on behalf of the company. In general, 
before making any external communication or disclosure, you should consult our ​Employee Communications 
Policy​ and our ​Communications and Disclosure Policy​. 
V. Protect Google’s Assets 
Google has a well-earned reputation for generosity with our employee benefits and openness with 
confidential information shared within the company. Our ability to continue these practices depends on how 
well we conserve company resources and protect company assets and information. 
June 2019 version 
7 

Intellectual Property 
Google’s intellectual property rights (our trademarks, logos, copyrights, trade secrets, “know-how”, and 
patents) are among our most valuable assets. Unauthorized use can lead to their loss or serious loss of 
value. You must respect all copyright and other intellectual property laws, including laws governing the fair 
use of copyrights, trademarks, and brands. You must never use Google’s (or its affiliated entities’) logos, 
marks, or other protected information or property for any business or commercial venture without 
pre-clearance from the Marketing team. We strongly encourage you to report any suspected misuse of 
trademarks, logos, or other Google intellectual property to ​Legal​. 
Likewise, respect the intellectual property rights of others. Inappropriate use of others’ intellectual property 
may expose Google and you to criminal and civil fines and penalties. Please seek advice from Legal before 
you solicit, accept, or use proprietary information from individuals outside the company or let them use or 
have access to Google proprietary  information. You should also check with Legal if developing a product 
that uses content not belonging to Google. 
A word about open source – Google is committed to open source software development. Consistent with our 
policy of respecting the valid intellectual property rights of others, we strictly comply with the license 
requirements under which open source software is distributed. Failing to do so may lead to legal claims 
against Google, as well as significant damage to the company’s reputation and its standing in the open 
source community. Please seek guidance from Legal and the ​Open Source Programs Office​ before 
incorporating open source code into any Google product, service, or internal project. 
Company Equipment 
Google gives us the tools and equipment we need to do our jobs effectively, but counts on us to be 
responsible and not wasteful with the Google stuff we are given. Nobody’s going to complain if you snag an 
extra bagel on Friday morning, but company funds, equipment, and other physical assets are not to be 
requisitioned for purely personal use. Not sure if a certain use of company assets is okay? Please ask your 
manager or ​Human Resources​. 
The Network 
Google’s communication facilities (which include both our network and the hardware that uses it, like 
computers and mobile devices) are a critical aspect of our company’s property, both physical and 
intellectual. Be sure to follow all ​security policies​. If you have any reason to believe that our network security 
has been violated – for example, you lose your laptop or smart phone or think that your network password 
may have been compromised – please promptly report the incident to ​Information Security​. For more 
information, consult ​Google's Security Policy. 
Physical Security 
If you’re not careful, people may steal your stuff. Always secure your laptop, important equipment, and your 
personal belongings, even while on Google’s premises. Always wear your badge visibly while on site. Don’t 
tamper with or disable security and safety devices. Watch people who “tailgate” behind you through our 
doors. If you don’t see a Google badge, please ask for it (and, as appropriate, direct the person to a 
receptionist for assistance). Promptly report any suspicious activity to ​Google Security.​ For more 
information, review ​Google’s Physical Security Policy​. 
Use of Google’s Equipment and Facilities 
June 2019 version 
8 

Anything you do using Google’s corporate electronic facilities (e.g., our computers, mobile devices, network, 
etc.) or store on our premises (e.g., letters, memos, and other documents) might be disclosed to people 
inside and outside the company. For example, Google may be required by law (e.g., in response to a 
subpoena or warrant) to monitor, access, and disclose the contents of corporate email, voicemail, computer 
files, and other materials on our electronic facilities or on our premises. In addition, the company may 
monitor, access, and disclose employee communications and other information on our corporate electronic 
facilities or on our premises where there is a business need to do so, such as protecting employees and 
users, maintaining the security of resources and property, or investigating suspected employee misconduct. 
Employee Data 
We collect and store personal information from employees around the world. Access this data only in line 
with local law and Google internal policies, and be sure to handle employee data in a manner that is 
consistent with Google’s Data Classification and Employment Data Guidelines and other Google policies. 
VI. Ensure Financial Integrity and Responsibility 
Financial integrity and fiscal responsibility are core aspects of corporate professionalism. This is more than 
accurate reporting of our financials, though that’s certainly important. The money we spend on behalf of 
Google is not ours; it’s the company’s and, ultimately, our shareholders’. Each person at Google – not just 
those in Finance – has a role in making sure that money is appropriately spent, our financial records are 
complete and accurate, and internal controls are honored. This matters every time we hire a new vendor, 
expense something to Google, sign a new business contract, or enter into any deals on Google’s behalf. 
To make sure that we get this right, Google maintains a system of internal controls to reinforce our 
compliance with legal, accounting, tax, and other regulatory requirements in every location in which we 
operate. 
Stay in full compliance with our system of internal controls, and don’t hesitate to contact Ethics & 
Compliance or Finance if you have any questions. What follows are some core concepts that lie at the 
foundation of financial integrity and fiscal responsibility here at Google. 
Spending Google’s Money 
A core Google value has always been to spend money wisely. When you submit an expense for 
reimbursement or spend money on Google’s behalf, make sure that the cost is reasonable, directly related to 
company business, and supported by appropriate documentation. Always record the business purpose (e.g., 
if you take someone out to dinner on Google, always record in our expense reimbursement tool the full 
names and titles of the people who attended as well as the reason for the dinner) and comply with other 
submission requirements. If you’re uncertain about whether you should spend money or submit an expense 
for reimbursement, check with your manager. Managers are responsible for all money spent and expenses 
incurred by their direct reports, and should carefully review such spend and expenses before approving. 
Signing a Contract 
Each time you enter into a business transaction on Google’s behalf, there should be documentation 
recording that agreement, approved by the ​Legal Department.​ Signing a contract on behalf of Google is a 
very big deal. Never sign any contract on behalf of Google unless all of the following are met: 
●You are authorized to do so under our Signature Authority and Approval Policy. If you are unsure 
whether you are authorized, ask your manager 
June 2019 version 
9 

●The contract has been approved by Legal. If you are using an approved Google form contract, you 
don’t need further Legal approval unless you have made changes to the form contract or are using it 
for other than its intended purpose 
●You have studied the contract, understood its terms and decided that entering into the contract is in 
Google’s interest 
 
All contracts at Google should be in writing and should contain all of the relevant terms to which the parties 
are agreeing – Google does not permit “side agreements,” oral or written. 
Recording Transactions 
If your job involves the financial recording of our transactions, make sure that you’re fully familiar with all of 
the Google policies that apply, including our Revenue Recognition Policy and our ​Purchasing Policy​. 
Immediately report to Finance any transactions that you think are not being recorded correctly. 
Reporting Financial or Accounting Irregularities 
It goes without saying (but we’re going to say it anyway) that you should never, ever interfere in any way with 
the auditing of Google’s financial records. Similarly, you should never falsify any record or account, including 
time reports, expense accounts, and any other Google records. 
Familiarize yourself with our Reporting of Financial and Accounting Concerns Policy. If you suspect or 
observe any of the conduct mentioned above or, for that matter, any irregularities relating to financial 
integrity or fiscal responsibility, no matter how small, immediately report them to Ethics & Compliance. 
Hiring Suppliers 
As Google grows, we enter into more and more deals with suppliers of equipment and services. We should 
always strive for the best possible deal for Google. This almost always requires that you solicit competing 
bids to make sure that you’re getting the best offer. While price is very important, it isn’t the only factor worth 
considering. Quality, service, reliability, and the terms and conditions of the proposed deal may also affect 
the final decision. Please do not hesitate to contact the ​Purchasing Team​ if you have any questions 
regarding how to procure equipment or services. 
Retaining Records 
It’s important that we keep records for an appropriate length of time. The Google ​Records Retention Policy 
suggests minimum record retention periods for certain types of records. These are great guidelines, but keep 
in mind that legal requirements, accounting rules, and other external sources sometimes specify longer 
retention periods for certain types of records, and those control where applicable. In addition, if asked by 
Legal to retain records relevant to a litigation, audit, or investigation, do so until Legal tells you retention is no 
longer necessary. If you have any questions regarding the correct length of time to retain a record, contact 
the Records Retention Team. 
VII. Obey the Law 
Google takes its responsibilities to comply with laws and regulations very seriously and each of us is 
expected to comply with applicable legal requirements and prohibitions. While it’s impossible for anyone to 
June 2019 version 
10 

know all aspects of every applicable law, you should understand the major laws and regulations that apply to 
your work. Take advantage of Legal and Ethics & Compliance to assist you here. A few specific laws are easy 
to violate unintentionally and so are worth pointing out here: 
Trade Controls 
U.S. and international trade laws control where Google can send or receive its products and/or services. 
These laws are complex, and apply to: 
●imports and exports from or into the U.S. 
●imports and exports of products from or into other countries, with additional concerns when those 
products contain components or technology of U.S. origin 
●exports of services or providing services to non-U.S. persons 
●exports of technical data, especially when the technical data is of U.S. origin 
 
What constitutes an “import” or “export” under the law is pretty broad. For example: 
 
●exposing or allowing access by non-U.S. persons to U.S. technical data can be an “export”, 
regardless of what country the exposure occurred in 
●sending a server from one country (“country X”) into another country (“country Y”) is an export from 
country X and an import into country Y 
●permitting the download of software from one country (“country X”) into another country (“country 
Y”) is an export from country X 
●transporting technical data or software on your laptop, or tools or equipment in your luggage, may be 
an export and import 
 
The bottom line: If you are in any way involved in sending or making available Google products, services, 
software, equipment, or any form of technical data from one country to another, work with your manager to 
be absolutely sure that the transaction stays well within the bounds of applicable laws. If you or your 
manager are not sure, please contact Ethics & Compliance. 
Competition Laws 
Most countries have laws – known as “antitrust,” “competition,” or “unfair competition” laws – designed to 
promote free and fair competition. Generally speaking, these laws prohibit 1) arrangements with competitors 
that restrain trade in some way, 2) abuse of intellectual property rights, and 3) use of market power to 
unfairly disadvantage competitors. 
 
Certain conduct is absolutely prohibited under these laws, and could result in your imprisonment, not to 
mention severe penalties for Google. 
 
Examples of prohibited conduct include: 
 
●agreeing with competitors about prices 
●agreeing with competitors to rig bids or to allocate customers or markets 
●agreeing with competitors to boycott a supplier or customer 
 
Other activities can also be illegal, unfair, or create the appearance of impropriety. Such activities include: 
 
●sharing competitively sensitive information (e.g., prices, costs, market distribution, etc.) with 
competitors 
June 2019 version 
11 

●entering into a business arrangement or pursuing a strategy with the sole purpose of harming a 
competitor 
●using Google’s size or strength to gain an unfair competitive advantage 
 
Although the spirit of these laws is straightforward, their application to particular situations can be quite 
complex. 
 
Google is committed to competing fair and square, so please contact Ethics & Compliance if you have any 
questions about the antitrust laws and how they apply to you. Any personnel found to have violated Google’s 
Antitrust Policies will, subject to local laws, be disciplined, up to and including termination of employment. If 
you suspect that anyone at the company is violating the competition laws, notify Ethics & Compliance 
immediately. 
Insider Trading Laws 
As we said earlier, internally we share information, including non-public information, about Google’s business 
operations pretty freely (think of TGIF). In addition, you may overhear a hallway conversation or come across 
a memo at a copy machine, either of which might involve confidential information. To use this non-public 
information to buy or sell stock, or to pass it along to others so that they may do so, could constitute insider 
trading. Insider trading not only violates this Code, it violates the law. Don’t do it. 
You should familiarize yourself with Google’s ​Insider Trading Policy​. It describes company-wide policies that 
address the risks of insider trading, such as a prohibition on any Google employee hedging Google stock; and 
periodic blackout windows when no Google employee may trade Google stock. 
Anti-bribery Laws 
Like all businesses, Google is subject to lots of laws, both U.S. and non-U.S., that prohibit bribery in virtually 
every kind of commercial setting. The rule for us at Google is simple – don’t bribe anybody, anytime, for any 
reason. 
Non-government relationships 
You should be careful when you give gifts and pay for meals, entertainment, or other business courtesies on 
behalf of Google. We want to avoid the possibility that the gift, entertainment, or other business courtesy 
could be perceived as a bribe, so it’s always best to provide such business courtesies infrequently and, when 
we do, to keep their value moderate. Consult Google’s ​Non-Government Related Gifts and Client 
Entertainment Policy​ before providing any business courtesies and contact Ethics & Compliance if you have 
any questions. 
Dealing with government officials 
Offering gifts, entertainment, or other business courtesies that could be perceived as bribes becomes 
especially problematic if you’re dealing with a government official. “Government officials” include any 
government employee; candidate for public office; or employee of government-owned or -controlled 
companies, public international organizations, or political parties. Several laws around the world, including 
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act, specifically prohibit offering or giving anything 
of value to government officials to influence official action or to secure an improper advantage. This not only 
includes traditional gifts, but also things like meals, travel, political or charitable contributions, and job offers 
for government officials’ relatives. Never give gifts to thank government officials for doing their jobs. By 
contrast, it can be permissible to make infrequent and moderate expenditures for gifts and business 
entertainment for government officials that are directly tied to promoting our products or services (e.g., 
June 2019 version 
12 

providing a modest meal at a day-long demonstration of Google products). Payment of such expenses can 
be acceptable (assuming they are permitted under local law) but may require pre-approval from Ethics & 
Compliance under Google’s ​Anti-Bribery and Government Ethics Policy​. 
The U.S. also has strict rules that severely limit the ability of a company or its employees to give gifts and 
business courtesies to a U.S. government official and also limit the official’s ability to accept such gifts. The 
Honest Leadership and Open Government Act prohibits giving any gifts, including travel and other courtesies, 
to Members, Officers, and employees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives unless they fit within 
one of a number of specific exceptions. Gifts to employees of the U.S. executive branch are also regulated 
and subject to limits. Finally, state and local government officials in the U.S. are also subject to additional 
legal restrictions. Consult Google’s ​Anti-Bribery and Government Ethics Policy​ before giving any such gifts or 
business courtesies and obtain all required pre-approvals. In sum, before offering any gifts or business 
courtesies to a U.S. or other government official, you should consult Google’s ​Anti-Bribery and Government 
Ethics Policy​. Carefully follow the limits and prohibitions described there, and obtain any required 
pre-approvals. If after consulting the Policy you aren’t sure what to do, ask Ethics & Compliance. 
VIII. Conclusion 
Google aspires to be a different kind of company. It’s impossible to spell out every possible ethical scenario 
we might face. Instead, we rely on one another’s good judgment to uphold a high standard of integrity for 
ourselves and our company. We expect all Googlers to be guided by both the letter and the spirit of this Code 
and Google’s values. Sometimes, identifying the right thing to do isn’t an easy call. If you aren’t sure, don’t be 
afraid to ask questions of your manager, Legal or Ethics & Compliance. 
And remember... if you see something that you think isn’t right – speak up! 
⃣   I certify that I have read and understand the Google Code of Conduct and will comply with it in connection 
with my services to Google. I further understand that adherence to the Code of Conduct is a requirement of 
my engagement at Google and that breach of same can result in my engagement being discontinued.

<!-- This file was auto-generated from 2025_02_03-Google RMI Spaces Policy 2.03.2024.pdf -->



 
 
Google RMI Spaces Policy 
 
Scope: This policy applies to all GlobalLogic project team members performing services on 
any Google Cloud project, including all GlobalLogic employees, temporary employees, and 
third party contractors employed by a GlobalLogic vendor (“Project Team Members”). 
 
Purpose: To clarify Project Team Member use of Spaces during working time. 
 
Permied Use of Spaces: Project Team Members may use Google Spaces during working 
time for project-related work and in Authorized Spaces only. Authorized Spaces are those 
Spaces established by Project Team Members in Authorized Roles for the purpose of 
communicating project guidance, answering work or task-related questions, and to 
otherwise facilitate the ability to manage projects. Authorized Roles are: Task Lead/L1; 
PO/PAO/L2 Sr. PAO, PGMs, POD leads. To establish an Authorized Space, an Authorized Role 
must add a Project Team Member in a role one level up as a co-sponsor.  For example, to 
establish an Authorized Space, a Task Lead must add a PO co-sponsor, a PO must add a PAO 
co-sponsor, a PAO must add a L2 co-sponsor, etc.  
 
Prohibited Uses: Project Team Members are prohibited from using Google Spaces or any 
other social media or external collaboration tools during working time except for 
project-related work and in Authorized Spaces only.  
 
Project Team Members may not use un-authorized Spaces (such as any non project-related 
social Spaces) during working time. Violations of this policy will result in disciplinary action, 
up to and including termination (or, if you are a third party contractor, removal from 
GlobalLogic projects). 
 
Expected Behavior: When participating in work-related discussions, file-sharing, or 
collaborative projects on Authorized Spaces you must follow all GlobalLogic policies, 
including those related to confidentiality, professionalism, anti-harassment and 
discrimination, and respectful conduct.  
 
 

 
In both Authorized Spaces and un-authorized Spaces, you are expected to: 
 
● Always be fair and courteous to your colleagues. If you decide to post complaints or 
criticism, avoid using statements, photographs, video or audio that reasonably could 
be viewed as malicious, obscene, threatening or intimidating, that disparage 
customers, vendors, suppliers, your colleagues, or that might constitute harassment 
or bullying.  Examples of such conduct might include oensive posts meant to 
intentionally harm someone’s reputation or posts that could contribute to a hostile 
work environment on the basis of race, sex, disability, national origin, sexual 
orientation, religion, or any other status protected by federal, state and local law or 
GlobalLogic policy. 
● Avoid knowingly posting false information. Always strive to be honest and accurate 
when posting information or news, and if you make a mistake, correct it quickly.  Be 
open about any previous posts you have altered. Never post any information or 
rumors that you know to be false about GlobalLogic, colleagues, customers, vendors, 
suppliers or members of the public. 
 
Violations of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination (or, if 
you are a third party contractor, removal from GlobalLogic projects). In particular, conduct on 
Authorized or un-authorized Spaces that adversely aects your job performance, the 
performance of colleagues, or that include discriminatory remarks, harassment, threats of 
violence, or similar inappropriate or unlawful conduct, will not be tolerated. 
Retaliation is prohibited: GlobalLogic prohibits taking negative action against any employee 
or contractor for reporting a possible violation of this policy or for cooperating in an 
investigation.  Any employee who retaliates against another employee or contractor for 
reporting a possible violation of this policy or for cooperating in an investigation will be 
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
Any employee or contractor who believes they have been retaliated against for reporting a 
possible violation of this policy, or who is aware of such behavior against others, should 
immediately provide a wrien report to their immediate supervisor, or the GlobalLogic Hotline 
(globallogic.com/hotline ). 
Exceptions for Protected Activity: Nothing in this policy should be construed to limit the 
rights of non-supervisory employees to discuss wages, hours or working conditions, engage 
in union activity, or otherwise engage in protected concerted activity under Section 7 of the 
National Labor Relations Act.

URGENT & CONFIDENTIAL: Final Correspondence: Year-Long Unresolved Pay
Disparity -- Attached Evidentiary Analysis of Systemic Labor, Compliance, and
National Security Risks
dgerabagi@gmail.com <dgerabagi@gmail.com>Wed, Jun 25, 2025 at 8:29 PM
To: Cynet HR <hr@cynetsystems.com>
Cc: Avneesh Shukla <avneesh.s@cynetsystems.com>
To the Cynet HR Team,
Thank you for your email of June 25, 2025, acknowledging receipt of my correspondence dated June 23, 
2025.
To ensure a productive and accountable path forward, could you please provide the name and title of the 
individual at Cynet who has been assigned to lead the resolution of this matter?
While I appreciate the offer to find a resolution that meets my "expectations," my previous 
correspondence was not about personal satisfaction. It was a formal evidentiary analysis detailing 
systemic issues with legal, operational, and national security implications that require a substantive, 
point-by-point response.
To be clear, your response did not address the core findings of my report, which are:
1. The irrefutable labor misclassification based on my duties and industry standards.
2. The material breach of the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, to which Cynet is contractually 
bound.
3. The national security vulnerabilities created by the current workforce model.
I am open to a meeting to discuss these matters. However, to make such a meeting productive, I request 
that you first provide a written response addressing the three key findings outlined above. This will 
ensure we can have a focused conversation about a comprehensive resolution rather than a simple 
negotiation over my personal case.
As my original letter stated, this is a time-sensitive issue with significant implications. I look forward to 
receiving your substantive response and the name of my designated point of contact.
Respectfully,
David Gerabagi

Afternoon David,
Thank you for reaching out and sharing your comprehensive analysis with us. I want to first acknowledge that there
has been a delay in responding to your concerns regarding labor misclassification and pay disparity. I sincerely
apologize for the lack of communication and any frustration this may have caused.
I want to assure you that this matter has now come to my desk and is being reviewed with the Director of Delivery and
other relevant leadership within our organization. We are committed to addressing your concerns thoroughly and
promptly. I am currently in the process of collecting more information to ensure that this matter is resolved
appropriately.
We recognize the seriousness of the issues you have raised, and we are taking them into consideration as we
evaluate the situation. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive response that addresses your individual case and the
broader systemic issues you have highlighted.
Please allow us some time to conduct a detailed review. Your patience and understanding in this matter are greatly
appreciated.
Thank you again for bringing this to our attention. We are committed to working towards a resolution that aligns with
both your expectations and our organizational standards.
Thank you,
Stephanie Graham

Dear Stephanie Graham,
Thank you for your email and for confirming you will be the primary point of contact for this matter. Establishing a clear
line of communication is a productive first step.
I note your commitment to provide a "comprehensive, point-by-point written response" to my report's findings. To
ensure clarity for all parties, please provide a specific date in the coming week by which I can expect to receive this
substantive reply. Given your use of the ambiguous phrase "the following week," this clarification is necessary to
prevent any undue delays.
While I look forward to your detailed response, I must reiterate that the core of this matter extends beyond my
"individual case." The central issues are the systemic legal, operational, and national security risks identified in the
Evidentiary Analysis I submitted. It is important we maintain this framing, as the document's legal and evidentiary
nature is central to the matter, distinguishing it from routine correspondence.
Your email did not address my request for a meeting. While your written response is a necessary foundation, it is not a
substitute for direct engagement. Such a meeting is the essential next step after you provide your analysis. Its
purpose is to ensure our interests are aligned in containing the significant legal and national security liabilities
detailed in my report, allowing us to move beyond a review of the facts and toward a tangible resolution.
I look forward to your prompt reply with a specific date for your forthcoming response and your availability for a
meeting.
Respectfully,
David Gerabagi

# An Evidentiary Analysis of Labor Misclassification and Systemic Risk in the Matter of David Gerabagi vs. Cynet Systems Inc.

![][image1]

***Description:** A single, spotlighted legal document—the report itself—sits on a dark, polished table. From this document, glowing lines of light extend outwards, connecting to a series of holographic icons: a courtroom gavel, a crumbling corporate logo for "Cynet," the stressed silhouette of a worker at a desk, and a geopolitical chessboard showing tension between the U.S. and China. The image visualizes the report's central thesis: one case reveals a cascade of interconnected risks at every level.*

An introduction to the analysis, framing a specific internal compensation case not as an isolated anomaly but as a sentinel event—an early warning signal pointing to deep-seated systemic flaws that introduce risks to product integrity, corporate security, and geopolitical standing.

***Content:*** This report presents a critical, time-sensitive analysis of a strategic vulnerability originating from the company's current human capital strategy within its advanced AI division. The findings herein suggest that a foundational element of Cynet's approach to AI development is not only misaligned with its long-term objectives but also actively introduces systemic risks to product integrity, corporate security, and geopolitical standing. This analysis was prompted by an examination of a specific internal compensation case, which, upon investigation, revealed itself to be not an isolated anomaly but a sentinel event—a clinical term for an early warning signal that points to deep-seated systemic flaws.

The AI industry's immense valuation and technological sophistication are directly dependent on a foundation of legally precarious and economically exploited human labor. This system is best understood through the academic frameworks of the "fissured workplace" and a three-tiered AI value chain model comprised of the Client, the Intermediary, and the "Ghost Worker" \[114, 117\]. The fissured workplace model describes how large corporations strategically distance themselves from the workers who create their products, outsourcing core functions to a web of subcontractors to shed legal and financial liability \[117\]. This creates a global digital assembly line populated by "ghost workers"—so named because their labor is essential but invisible, uncredited, and performed under precarious conditions \[116\]. The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive, data-driven assessment of this vulnerability as it manifests in the Gerabagi matter and to propose a clear, strategic path forward that mitigates the identified risks while simultaneously positioning Cynet for decisive industry leadership.

**Confidentiality Notice:** This report is prepared for the exclusive use of the leadership of Cynet Systems Inc. and its designated legal counsel. Its contents are confidential and protected by the work product doctrine. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited.

## **Executive Summary** {#executive-summary}

![][image2]

***Description:** In a vast, dark server farm representing the AI industry, a single, fallen canary lies in a small, illuminated spot on the floor. The image of the dead canary serves as a stark, powerful metaphor for a "sentinel event"—a small, early warning of a much larger, unseen, and systemic danger threatening the entire technological ecosystem.*

A single case as a warning signal: The misclassification of one AI worker is not an anomaly but a symptom of a systemic crisis threatening Cynet's legal, operational, and strategic viability, creating a cascade of interconnected risks that culminate in a national security vulnerability.

---

***Content:*** This report establishes that the employment situation of David Gerabagi is not an anomaly but a sentinel event—a clear warning of a systemic, enterprise-level crisis facing Cynet Systems Inc. The misclassification and under-compensation of this highly skilled AI Quality Analyst at $21/hr is a direct consequence of a "fissured workplace" model designed for labor arbitrage \[117\]. This model represents a material breach of contract, California labor law, and the Google Supplier Code of Conduct. More critically, it reveals a cascade of interconnected risks that threaten the company's legal standing, operational viability, and its relationship with key clients. We will demonstrate that the current labor model is (1) legally indefensible and creates massive financial liability, as evidenced by emerging class-action lawsuits in the industry \[119\]; (2) operationally self-defeating, as it systematically degrades the quality of the AI training data it is meant to produce by exploiting its "ghost workers" \[120\]; and (3) a source of profound reputational and geopolitical risk, transforming a critical component of the U.S. AI ecosystem into a national security vulnerability. This report concludes with a set of urgent, strategic recommendations designed to mitigate these existential threats and pivot Cynet from a high-risk model to one of industry leadership and sustainable competitive advantage.

## 

## **Section 1: The Factual and Evidentiary Basis of the David Gerabagi Matter** {#section-1:-the-factual-and-evidentiary-basis-of-the-david-gerabagi-matter}

![][image3]

***Description:** A detective's evidence board. In the center is a professional headshot of a man (representing David Gerabagi). Red strings connect the photo to various pieces of evidence pinned to the board: printed-out email chains, an official-looking contract stamped "MISCLASSIFIED," corporate logos for Cynet and GlobalLogic, a calendar with an entire year circled in red, and two pay stubs showing a clear wage disparity.*

Laying the foundation of fact: This section establishes the undeniable, documented reality of the case, from the initial role change and the qualifications of the subject to the persistent, year-long failure of the corporate supply chain to address the resulting pay disparity.

### 

### **1.1. Introduction of the Subject** {#1.1.-introduction-of-the-subject}

![][image4]

***Description:** A dramatic, unbalanced scale. On one side, a heavy, glowing weight labeled "Master's Degree in Cybersecurity" and "AI Quality Analyst" crushes the scale downwards. On the other side, a tiny, insignificant stack of coins labeled "$21/hr" is lifted high into the air, visually representing the profound and indefensible misalignment between qualifications and compensation.*

The fundamental disconnect: A highly qualified professional performing complex AI analysis is classified and compensated as a low-skill worker, creating the core conflict of this case.

***Content:*** This analysis centers on the employment of Mr. David Gerabagi, a contractor with a Master's degree in Cybersecurity, engaged by Cynet Systems Inc. ("Cynet"). Mr. Gerabagi was assigned to a project for Google, managed by the prime contractor GlobalLogic, to serve as a non-technical Content Writer. In reality, Mr. Gerabagi is performing the work of a highly-skilled AI Quality Analyst. His qualifications and the technical nature of his role are fundamentally misaligned with his compensation and classification, forming the basis of a significant and multifaceted risk to Cynet.

### **1.2. Timeline of Key Events** {#1.2.-timeline-of-key-events}

![][image5]

***Description:** A calendar page for MAY 2024 is shown, with the 7th circled in red and labeled "ROLE CHANGE." A fast-forward animation shows calendar pages flipping rapidly until it stops on MAY 2025, also circled in red. A large, ominous clock face is superimposed over the calendar, its hands having made a full circle, with the text "ONE YEAR. NO RESPONSE." glowing underneath.*

The transformation of an administrative issue into systemic neglect: A year of documented inaction following a material role change establishes a pattern of willful disregard for a worker's legitimate grievance.

---

***Content:*** The dispute originated from a material change in Mr. Gerabagi's role that was not accompanied by a corresponding change in compensation. The critical timeline is as follows:

* **May 7, 2024:** Mr. Gerabagi was moved from his prior non-technical “Content Writer” team to a new project team. His functional role was now also technical, and that of a "Junior Python Developer," a position with substantively different responsibilities and higher market value than his previous assignment. This change was implemented without any adjustment to his compensation or official job title, creating an immediate and quantifiable discrepancy.  
* **June 2024 \- May 2025:** For a period of approximately one year following the role change, Mr. Gerabagi made persistent, documented attempts to rectify the pay disparity with both Cynet and GlobalLogic. These efforts were consistently met with inaction, deferral, or silence. This extended period of unresponsiveness transforms the issue from a potential administrative oversight into a pattern of systemic neglect.

---

### 

### **1.3. Documented Failure of Internal Resolution Channels** {#1.3.-documented-failure-of-internal-resolution-channels}

![][image6]

***Description:** An animated diagram shows a red "GRIEVANCE" ticket originating from a worker icon. The ticket travels up to a logo for "CYNET" (subcontractor), which then "passes the buck" by bouncing the ticket to a logo for "GLOBALLOGIC" (prime contractor). GlobalLogic then bounces the ticket back to Cynet. This repeats, creating an endless, frustrating loop of deflected responsibility, illustrating the bureaucratic firewall.*

The bureaucratic firewall: Documented evidence reveals a structural flaw in the contracting supply chain, where responsibility is perpetually deflected, leaving the worker without recourse and establishing a pattern of willful neglect.

---

***Content:*** Mr. Gerabagi's attempts to resolve the issue through official channels provide clear evidence of a breakdown in accountability across the entire contracting supply chain. Specific communications with key personnel at both Cynet and GlobalLogic document this failure:

* **Cynet Systems Contacts:** Mr. Gerabagi repeatedly raised the issue with his designated Cynet representatives, including Avneesh Shukla and Nikhil Yadav. These communications establish that Cynet, as the direct employer of record, was fully aware of the pay discrepancy and its employee's formal complaint. The lack of resolution demonstrates a failure by Cynet to fulfill its basic obligations to its employee.  
* **GlobalLogic Contacts:** The matter was simultaneously escalated to management at GlobalLogic, the prime contractor managing the Google project. Communications with GlobalLogic managers Darren Lucas and Shruthi Ketepalle confirm their awareness of the situation. Their failure to intervene and compel their subcontractor, Cynet, to adhere to fair labor practices indicates a lack of governance and oversight.

The documented email correspondence reveals a clear "pass the buck" dynamic, where responsibility for resolving the pay issue was continuously deflected between Cynet and GlobalLogic. This created a bureaucratic firewall that left the worker without any effective recourse, highlighting a structural flaw in the management of the contingent workforce. A year-long failure to address a clear-cut pay dispute is not a series of individual errors; it is evidence of a system designed to suppress labor costs by ignoring contractor grievances, thereby establishing a pattern of willful neglect that will be highly damaging in any legal proceeding.

### **1.4. Quantifiable Compensation Disparity** {#1.4.-quantifiable-compensation-disparity}

![][image7]

***Description:** A side-by-side comparison. On the left, a pay stub for the subject shows a wage of "$21/HR." On the right, a pay stub for a peer doing the same job shows "$28/HR." A large red arrow points from the lower number to the higher, with text that reads "33% INTERNAL PAY GAP." In the background, a stock ticker for "AI MARKET RATE" soars into the six figures, emphasizing the gross external disparity.*

The financial injury: A specific and quantifiable underpayment relative to both internal peers and external market rates, suggesting arbitrary, negligent, or discriminatory compensation practices.

***Content:*** The financial injury to Mr. Gerabagi is specific, quantifiable, and exists on two levels: a significant internal disparity and a catastrophic external disparity, representing a gross underpayment relative to both internal and external benchmarks.

* **Internal Disparity:** Mr. Gerabagi was compensated at a rate of **$21/hr**. This is substantially lower than the documented rate of **$28/hr** paid to other contractors performing identical work on the same team. This 33% pay gap for the same role is arbitrary, indefensible, and suggests discriminatory or negligent compensation practices.  
* **External Market Disparity:** As will be detailed in Section 3, the $21/hr rate is grossly disconnected from the established market value for an "AI Quality Analyst" or "RLHF Specialist" in the California labor market, particularly for an individual possessing a Master's degree. This larger chasm, which compares contractor pay to that of full-time employees at the client company,and the implications if extrapolated across a large ghost workforce, reveals a systemic practice of labor arbitrage that is the core focus of this report.

### 

### **1.5. Evidentiary Appendix References** {#1.5.-evidentiary-appendix-references}

![][image8]

***Description:** A dramatic, top-down shot of an overflowing legal file folder on a dark wood desk. The folder is labeled "GERABAGI vs. CYNET SYSTEMS." Spilling out are key documents: printed emails with highlighted text ("Client Moved Me to a New Team"), an organizational chart showing a clear discrepancy, and a final, urgent letter. The lighting is stark and focused, emphasizing the weight and seriousness of the evidence.*

The paper trail: Anchoring the analysis in concrete, documentary evidence that establishes the timeline, the functional role, and the persistent failure of management to resolve the dispute.

---

***Content:*** The factual basis of this report is anchored in documentary evidence. The full text of the key email chains is provided in the appendices and referenced throughout this analysis.

## **Section 2: Analysis of Performed Duties and Required Qualifications: Establishing the Role of "AI Quality Analyst"** {#section-2:-analysis-of-performed-duties-and-required-qualifications:-establishing-the-role-of-"ai-quality-analyst"}

![][image9]

***Description:** A worker is shown at a holographic workbench. Instead of physical tools, they are using glowing digital instruments labeled "PROMPT ENGINEERING," "MODEL EVALUATION," and "TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION" to carefully assemble a complex AI brain. In the background, a discarded, dusty sign reads "JOB TITLE: CONTENT WRITER," visually contrasting the simplistic official title with the complex reality of the work.*

Deconstructing the job: A meticulous analysis of the actual work performed and the required qualifications, proving that the role is not that of a low-skill "content writer" but a high-value, specialized "AI Quality Analyst."

***Content:*** A foundational element of this analysis is the precise definition of the work performed by Mr. Gerabagi. The evidence demonstrates that his responsibilities extend far beyond the simplistic and often low-wage categorization of a "data rater" or "content writer." A meticulous deconstruction of his actual job duties, juxtaposed with the explicit requirement of a Master's degree, firmly establishes his role as a specialized and high-value "AI Quality Analyst." This classification, and the essential labor it represents, is a form of "ghost work"—rendered invisible by the corporate structure yet indispensable to the AI development pipeline \[114\]. This classification has been knowingly ignored by his employers for over a year, despite his promotion from a non-technical to a technical position, and multiple subsequent promotions within the advanced role.

### **2.1 Deconstruction of Job Duties and Educational Prerequisites** {#2.1-deconstruction-of-job-duties-and-educational-prerequisites}

![][image10]

***Description:** A three-panel infographic. Panel 1: Shows a hand crafting a complex, glowing key labeled **"PROMPT ENGINEERING"** to unlock a door on an AI model. Panel 2: Shows a hand drawing a detailed blueprint labeled **"TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION"** for a team of engineers. Panel 3: Shows a graduation cap with a **"MASTER'S DEGREE"** tassel being placed on a worker's head, powering up their abilities.*

The three pillars of high value: How sophisticated AI evaluation, strategic documentation, and an advanced degree requirement combine to define a role far exceeding a low-wage classification.

---

***Content:*** The detailed summary of Mr. Gerabagi's day-to-day responsibilities reveals a role centered on sophisticated AI evaluation, technical content creation, and strategic project support \[Artifact 21\]. These duties are characteristic of an analyst or specialist, not a low-level data processor.

**Prompt Engineering & AI Model Evaluation:** Mr. Gerabagi's tasks include "designing and refining prompts to test AI capabilities," "evaluating AI-generated content for quality, safety, and helpfulness," and "identifying and meticulously documenting model failures and edge cases." This work is not passive data labeling; it is an active, iterative process of probing, testing, and improving a complex AI system. These responsibilities directly align with job descriptions for roles like "AI Quality Analyst" and, notably, Google's own "Research Software Engineer, Generative AI Evaluations" \[98\]. This function is critical for the development, safety, and reliability of generative AI products.

**Technical Enablement & Strategic Documentation:** The role also encompasses the creation of high-level technical documentation. Responsibilities such as "creating technical enablement materials for internal teams," "developing training documentation for new project members," and "authoring slide decks for project stakeholders" are not tasks associated with entry-level content creation \[Artifact 21\]. They require a deep understanding of the project's technical underpinnings and strategic goals. This level of knowledge transfer and communication is a core function of analysts, specialists, and engineers who are tasked with scaling project knowledge and ensuring team alignment.

**Master's Degree Requirement:** The explicit requirement of a Master's degree for this position is a critical differentiator that elevates it far above standard contractor roles \[Artifact 21\]. This advanced educational prerequisite is inconsistent with low-wage work and is a standard qualification for specialized, high-paying positions in the technology and AI sectors. For example, roles like "AI Specialist" and "Research Software Engineer" frequently list advanced degrees as either required or highly preferred, and their compensation reflects this expectation \[98\]. The demand for a Master's degree signals that the client, Google, requires a candidate with advanced analytical, research, and critical thinking skills, which are being leveraged daily but are not being compensated appropriately by Cynet.

### **2.2 Industry Role Comparison and Correct Classification** {#2.2-industry-role-comparison-and-correct-classification}

![][image11]

***Description:** A Venn diagram. One circle, labeled "Content Writer," contains icons for "Marketing Copy" and "SEO." The other, larger circle, labeled "AI Quality Analyst," contains icons for "Data Quality," "Model Evaluation," and "Engineering Feedback." The name "David Gerabagi" is placed firmly and entirely within the "AI Quality Analyst" circle, visually demonstrating the correct classification.*

A clear distinction: When compared against industry-standard job descriptions, the performed duties are a direct match for a high-value "AI Quality Analyst," not a promotional "Content Writer," making the misclassification undeniable.

---

***Content:*** When Mr. Gerabagi's duties are compared against standard industry job descriptions, the correct classification becomes clear.

* **Versus "Content Writer":** A typical "Content Writer" role focuses on creating marketing copy, blog posts, and other promotional materials with an emphasis on brand storytelling and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) \[99\]. While Mr. Gerabagi writes, his output is technical documentation and analytical evaluation of AI, not marketing content. His work product is internal, technical, and aimed at product improvement, not external promotion.  
* **As "AI Quality Analyst":** The duties are a direct match for an "AI Quality Analyst" or "AI Specialist." These roles are defined by tasks such as ensuring the quality of data fueling AI systems, analyzing user interactions, refining the accuracy and reliability of AI tools, and working with engineering and product teams to improve model performance \[100\]. This perfectly describes the work Mr. Gerabagi performs for the Google project.

The nature of these responsibilities indicates that Mr. Gerabagi is not a cost center to be minimized, but a direct contributor to the value of Google's AI technology. His work in evaluating model safety, identifying failures, and creating training materials directly enhances the quality, mitigates the risk, and accelerates the development of a core Google product. This function is integral to the project's success and the protection of Google's brand reputation. Cynet and Google are therefore the direct beneficiaries of high-value intellectual labor that is essential to the commercial viability of a flagship technology, yet this labor is being compensated at a rate reserved for rudimentary, low-skill tasks. This fundamental disconnect is the basis for the compensation disparity detailed in the following section.

## 

## **Section 3: Comprehensive Market Compensation Analysis and Disparity Quantification** {#section-3:-comprehensive-market-compensation-analysis-and-disparity-quantification}

![][image12]

***Description:** A stark, infographic-style image. On one side of a scale is a single, small coin labeled "$21/hr". On the other side, a massive, heavy weight labeled "MASTER'S DEGREE," "PROMPT ENGINEERING," and "AI MODEL EVALUATION" crushes the scale, showing a profound and visually obvious imbalance. In the background, a stock market ticker for tech salaries trends sharply upwards, further emphasizing the disparity.*

Quantifying the gap: A data-driven analysis juxtaposing the subject's pay with public salary data and the client's own internal benchmarks, revealing a pay gap of such magnitude that it can only be understood as a gross misclassification of labor.

### 

### **3.1 Current Compensation Structure** {#3.1-current-compensation-structure}

![][image13]

***Description:** A close-up on a digital pay stub. The name "David Gerabagi" is at the top. The "Hourly Rate" field is highlighted in red and clearly shows "$21.00." The "Annualized Gross" field is also highlighted in red, showing "$43,680." The numbers are stark and clinical, establishing the baseline for the subsequent analysis.*

The baseline: Establishing the concrete, shockingly low compensation figure that serves as the foundation for measuring the financial disparity.

***Content:*** Mr. Gerabagi's compensation from Cynet is structured as follows:

* **Hourly Rate:** $21.00 per hour.  
* **Annualized Salary:** Based on a standard full-time schedule (40 hours/week, 52 weeks/year), this equates to a gross annual salary of **$43,680**.

This figure serves as the baseline against which all industry and client-side benchmarks are measured.

### **3.2 External Market Benchmarks for "AI Quality Analyst" and Similar Roles** {#3.2-external-market-benchmarks-for-"ai-quality-analyst"-and-similar-roles}

![][image14]

***Description:** A financial dashboard showing multiple data feeds from sources like ZipRecruiter, ERI, and AIJobs.net. All feeds point to salary ranges for "AI Analyst" and "AI Specialist" that are consistently in the $100,000 to $150,000 range. A single, small, flashing red dot labeled "Current Pay: $43,680" is shown far below these market-rate streams, visualizing its status as a radical outlier.*

The market verdict: Objective, third-party salary data from multiple sources overwhelmingly corroborates that the appropriate compensation for this role is in the six-figure range, establishing the current pay as grossly non-competitive.

---

***Content:*** An independent, data-driven analysis of Mr. Gerabagi's job duties and qualifications, conducted by an external AI model, concluded that the appropriate job title is "AI Quality Analyst" and identified an industry-accepted salary range of **$85,000 to $150,000** per year \[Artifact 21\]. This objective assessment is strongly corroborated by a wide array of publicly available salary data.

* **"Artificial Intelligence Analyst" Roles:** National data from ZipRecruiter for an "Artificial Intelligence Analyst" shows an average salary of **$100,058** per year, with a typical range between $77,000 (25th percentile) and $120,500 (75th percentile) \[100\].  
* **"AI Specialist" Roles in Dallas/Texas:** The compensation for AI specialists in the relevant geographic market is even higher. Data from ERI's Assessor Series reports an average salary of **$126,103** for an AI Specialist in Dallas, with a range of $86,885 to $153,972 \[101\]. ZipRecruiter confirms a strong local market, reporting an average of **$104,648** for an AI Specialist in Dallas \[26\].  
* **National "AI Specialist" Roles:** Broader national data further supports these figures, with SalaryExpert reporting a US average of **$118,040** \[102\] and AIJobs.net reporting a median salary of **$130,000** for an "AI Specialist" in its 2024 index \[103\].

While some data exists for more generic or lower-skilled titles like "Machine Learning Analyst" (average $73,261) or a broadly defined "Ai Specialist" (average $53,925), these benchmarks are inconsistent with the Master's degree requirement and the complex, generative nature of Mr. Gerabagi's duties \[104\]. The evidence overwhelmingly points to the higher salary ranges associated with specialized AI quality and analysis roles as the appropriate comparators.

### **3.3 The Google Standard: Internal Compensation for Comparable Roles** {#3.3-the-google-standard:-internal-compensation-for-comparable-roles}

![][image15]

***Description:** A screenshot of an official Google Careers job posting for "Research Software Engineer, Generative AI Evaluations." The listed base salary range, "$141,000 \- $202,000," is highlighted with a bright, glowing yellow box, establishing it as the ultimate, undeniable benchmark for the value of work.*

The ultimate benchmark: The end-client's own public job postings for a functionally identical role reveal the true monetary value they place on this labor, making the contractor's pay rate indefensible.

***Content:*** The most compelling evidence of the true value of Mr. Gerabagi's work comes from the end-client, Google. A publicly listed position for a "Research Software Engineer, Generative AI Evaluations, Health AI" at Google outlines responsibilities that are functionally analogous to those performed by Mr. Gerabagi, including the evaluation and testing of generative AI models \[98\].

The stated base salary range for this full-time Google position is **$141,000 to $202,000**, plus bonus, equity, and benefits \[98\]. This figure represents the direct monetary value that Google itself places on this type of labor. It serves as the ultimate benchmark for fair compensation, as it is the rate paid to direct employees performing the same critical function that Mr. Gerabagi provides it through a third-party contractor.

### **3.4 Quantifying the Financial Deficit** {#3.4-quantifying-the-financial-deficit}

***Description:** A financial dashboard displaying a worker's profile. A large, bright red number shows "ANNUAL DEFICIT: \-$158,320." Below it, a bar chart compares "ACTUAL PAY: $43,680" (a small, red bar) against "MARKET RATE: $202,000" (a massive, green bar). Text below the chart reads "PAYING 21.6% OF MARKET VALUE," starkly visualizing the financial harm.*

A categorical error: Synthesizing the data reveals a staggering financial deficit, proving the compensation is not a minor variance but a fundamental misvaluation of labor by a factor of up to five.

---

***Content:*** Synthesizing the baseline pay with the market and client benchmarks reveals a staggering financial deficit. The disparity is not a matter of minor negotiation but a fundamental misvaluation of labor.

* **Against the Low-End Industry Standard ($85,000):** Mr. Gerabagi is paid just **51.4%** of the low-end market rate identified by objective analysis. This represents an annual deficit of **$41,320**. To meet even this minimum standard, his salary would need to be nearly doubled (a **1.94x** increase).  
* **Against the High-End Google Standard ($202,000):** Mr. Gerabagi is paid a mere **21.6%**—or roughly one-fifth—of the rate for a comparable role within Google. This represents an annual deficit of **$158,320**. To align with the value Google places on this work, his salary would require an increase of almost five times (a **4.63x** increase).

---

---

The following table provides a clear, at-a-glance summary of this gross disparity.

| Role / Benchmark | Annual Salary | Annual Shortfall (vs. Current) | % of Benchmark Paid | Required Salary Multiplier |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Current Pay (David Gerabagi)** | **$43,680** | $0 | 100% | 1.00x |
| Low-End Industry Standard (AI Analyst) | $85,000 | **$41,320** | 51.4% | 1.94x |
| Median Industry Standard (AI Specialist, Dallas) | $126,103 | **$82,423** | 34.6% | 2.89x |
| High-End Standard (Google Comparable Role) | $202,000 | **$158,320** | 21.6% | 4.63x |

Table 3.1: Role & Compensation Disparity Summary. Data compiled from sources \[98, 100-104\].

As the data irrefutably shows, the current compensation is not a minor variance but a categorical error. Mr. Gerabagi is being compensated at a level appropriate for low-skill data entry while performing the work of a highly skilled AI specialist, in direct violation of the standards his employer, Cynet, is contractually obligated to uphold.

### **3.5 The True Market Disparity: The Fissured Workplace in Action** {#3.5-the-true-market-disparity:-the-fissured-workplace-in-action}

![][image17]

***Description:** A stark tale of two realities. On one side of a split screen, a 'GHOST WORKER' icon stands in a barren landscape with a single coin labeled '$43k'. On the other side, a 'DIRECT EMPLOYEE' icon stands in a lush, thriving environment with a large treasure chest overflowing with gold coins, stock certificates, and health symbols, labeled '$246k'. A massive chasm separates them, visualizing the systemic inequality of the fissured workplace.*

A tale of two workforces: Quantifying the chasm between a precarious contractor's bare-bones pay and the comprehensive, six-figure compensation package of a full-time employee at the client company, exposing the true cost of the fissured model.

---

***Content:*** The fissured workplace model functions as a mechanism for transferring risk from the corporation to the individual while capturing immense value for intermediaries. This system allows a firm like **GlobalLogic**, acquired by Hitachi for $9.6 billion with revenues over $1.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA margins exceeding 20%, and **Cynet Systems**, with revenues of $750 million, to be built upon a foundation of labor paid a fraction of the market rate \[133, 138\]. The profits generated by these intermediaries, and the significant cost savings realized by Google, are directly subsidized by the economic precarity of the contract workforce. A direct comparison between a contractor and a full-time employee reveals a two-tiered system where one workforce enjoys comprehensive benefits and high salaries, while the other subsists on precarious, low-wage piecework.

In stark contrast to Mr. Gerabagi's $43,680 annual income with no benefits, a full-time, mid-level (L4) Data Analyst at Google has a median total compensation of **$204,000**, which breaks down into a $150,000 base salary, $31,800 in annual stock grants, and a $21,700 bonus \[177\]. Beyond direct pay, the value of Google's benefits package is substantial, with some estimates placing its monetary value at nearly **$25,000** annually \[179\]. This includes comprehensive health insurance, a generous 401(k) match of up to $11,500 per year, paid time off, and numerous on-site perks like free meals \[179, 180\].

The following table starkly illustrates the chasm between these two workforces.

---

---

**Table 3.2: Comparative Annual Compensation Analysis: AI Contractor vs. Google Data Analyst (L4)**

| Compensation Component | Contract Data Annotator (Estimated) | Google Data Analyst (L4) (Direct Employee) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Base Annual Salary** | $41,600 (based on $20/hr, 40-hr week) | $150,000 |
| **Annual Bonus** | $0 | $21,700 |
| **Annual Stock/Equity** | $0 | $31,800 |
| **Health Insurance Value** | $0 (Worker pays full premium) | \~$15,000 (Estimated employer-paid premium value) |
| **Retirement (401k Match)** | $0 | $11,500 (Company match) |
| **Paid Time Off (Vacation, Sick)** | $0 (Income lost when not working) | \~$11,500 (Value of 20 days PTO at base salary) |
| **Other Monetized Perks** | $0 | \~$5,200 (Estimated value of free meals) |
| **Total Estimated Annual Compensation** | **$41,600** | **$246,700** |
| **Pay Disparity Ratio** | **1 : 5.9** |  |

Note: Contractor salary assumes consistent 40-hour work weeks, which is not guaranteed. Employee benefit values are estimates based on public data \[176, 177, 179\].

This 5.9x disparity is not merely a gap in numbers; it represents a fundamental difference in economic reality. The stability and comprehensive benefits enjoyed by the full-time employee are financed, in part, by the deliberate denial of those same securities to the ghost workers who perform the foundational labor of the AI age.

![][image18]

***Description:** A dark, cyberpunk-themed holographic map of Dallas is projected over a gritty, metallic table. A jagged, glowing red canyon cuts through the city, labeled 'THE GREAT WAGE DIVIDE.' On the left 'low wage' side, the map shows decaying, glitching buildings and red warning icons. A lone, pixelated family silhouette stands at the edge. On the right, prosperous side, explicitly labeled 'STABILITY & GROWTH,' the cityscape is vibrant, featuring glowing icons of new construction cranes, thriving corporate logos, and green, manicured parks. A sturdy, high-tech bridge, labeled 'LIVING WAGE,' is shown extending from the prosperous side but stops halfway, its end shattered and broken, failing to connect to the family, starkly visualizing their economic isolation and the impassable gap to financial stability.*

From abstract numbers to real-world consequences: This section translates the massive compensation deficit into its tangible impact on a family's quality of life in a major U.S. city, illustrating the difference between survival, stability, and upward mobility.

![][image19]

***Description:** A balance scale, with one side labeled "DALLAS COST OF LIVING" piled high with weights for housing, food, and healthcare, totaling "$106,870 (MIT Living Wage)." The other side, labeled "CURRENT SALARY," has a single, small weight of "$43,680" and is stuck high in the air, showing a catastrophic inability to meet basic needs.*

A catastrophic shortfall: Comparing the suppressed salary to objective cost-of-living data for Dallas reveals an income that is fundamentally insufficient to support a family, falling below even modest budget thresholds.

---

***Content:*** The financial deficit of $41,000 to $158,000 per year is not an abstract figure. For David Gerabagi and his family of four living in Dallas, Texas, this gap represents the difference between financial precarity and stability, and between stagnation and the opportunity for upward mobility. This section translates the quantitative analysis into the tangible, real-world consequences of Cynet's wage suppression, using a tiered framework to illustrate the profound impact on the family's quality of life and future prospects.

The Dallas metropolitan area has the highest cost of living in the state of Texas and is rising \[105\]. Data from the Economic Policy Institute's Family Budget Calculator estimates that a family of two adults and two children in the Dallas metro area requires an annual income of **$82,216** (or $6,851 per month) just to meet a modest but adequate standard of living \[106\]. The MIT Living Wage Calculator is even higher, estimating a required pre-tax income of **$106,870** for the same family structure in Dallas County \[107\].

Mr. Gerabagi's gross annual salary of **$43,680** (approximately $3,640 per month) falls catastrophically short of these basic thresholds. It is less than 54% of the EPI's modest budget and only 41% of the MIT Living Wage. This income level is fundamentally insufficient to support a family of four in Dallas without incurring significant debt, relying on other sources of income, or making extreme sacrifices in essential areas like housing, healthcare, and nutrition.

The rungs above them—labeled "PRECARITY ($85k)," "STABILITY ($120k)," and "UPWARD MOBILITY ($160k)"—are shown stretching far out of their reach. The image visually translates the abstract pay gap into the tangible denial of opportunity.*

The chasm of opportunity: Visualizing the stark difference in quality of life across distinct income tiers, from a state of constant financial crisis to genuine stability and the ability to build generational wealth.

---

***Content:*** The chasm between Mr. Gerabagi's current earnings and a professionally appropriate salary can be visualized across distinct tiers of financial well-being.

* **Bankruptcy/Survival ($40k-$50k):** Mr. Gerabagi's current salary of **$43,680** places his family in this bottom tier. This income is far below the median household income for the city of Dallas (approx. $67,760) and is categorized as "middle-class" only for an individual, not a family \[107\]. At this level, every expense is a source of stress, savings are impossible, and any unexpected event—a car repair, a medical bill—can trigger a financial crisis. This is a state of constant financial precarity, which research shows imposes a "cognitive tax" that impairs decision-making and reduces overall health and productivity \[69\].  
* **Precarity ($80k-$90k):** An income of **$85,000**—the low end of the fair market range for his role—would lift the family to this tier. It aligns with the basic income needed to meet expenses in Dallas \[107\]. However, it represents the very definition of living paycheck-to-paycheck. While bills can be paid, there is little to no capacity for meaningful savings, investment, or discretionary spending. This is the reality for many households, but it is not the expected outcome for a professional with a Master's degree in a high-demand field.  
* **Stability ($120k):** An income of **$120,000** marks the transition to genuine financial stability for a family in the Dallas area. This figure aligns with the median household income in desirable Dallas suburbs and surpasses the MIT Living Wage threshold \[107\]. At this level, a family can comfortably afford housing, healthcare, and other necessities while also consistently saving for retirement, contributing to children's education funds, and absorbing financial shocks without falling into crisis. This is the standard of living that should be accessible to Mr. Gerabagi.  
* **Upward Mobility ($160k):** An income of **$160,000** places a family firmly in the upper-middle class in Texas, where the threshold is approximately $151,560 \[108\]. This level of income provides the resources for significant investments in assets that build generational wealth, such as real estate in more affluent neighborhoods, and more aggressive investment portfolios. It represents the ability to not just be stable, but to actively improve one's economic standing.  
* **Investment Class ($200k+):** An income of **$202,000** or more, which aligns with Google's own compensation for this work, places a family in the top echelon of earners. A 2024 report found that an income of **$208,000** is required for a family of four to live "comfortably" and securely in Dallas \[109\]. At this level, a host of sophisticated financial and investment opportunities become available, fundamentally changing the family's economic trajectory.

The following table starkly illustrates the opportunities being denied by the current suppressed wage.

| **$85,000 (Low-End Fair)** | **Precarity** | Meets basic needs but lives paycheck-to-paycheck; little to no discretionary income or savings capacity. | Basic retirement contributions (if possible); emergency fund building. |
| **$120,000 (Stability)** | **Stability** | Comfortably covers all necessities; can consistently save for retirement and education; can absorb financial shocks. | Full utilization of 401(k)/IRA; 529 education plans. |
| **$160,000 (Upward Mobility)** | **Upward Mobility** | Significant discretionary income; ability to make major investments in assets (e.g., housing, portfolio) to build wealth. | Backdoor Roth IRA; taxable brokerage accounts; tax-loss harvesting. |
| **$202,000+ (Investment Class)** | **Investment Class** | Achieves "comfortable" living standard; focus shifts to advanced wealth management and preservation. | Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs); Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs); Real Estate; Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZs). |

***Description:** A worker is shown at the bottom of a deep pit. A ladder labeled "FINANCIAL SECURITY" is hanging just out of reach. The rungs of the ladder are labeled with financial tools like "401(k)," "529 PLAN," and "INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO." The image symbolizes how the suppressed wage actively denies the worker access to the tools needed to build a secure future.*

The opportunity cost of exploitation: The most damaging aspect of underpayment is not just the monthly shortfall, but the active and ongoing denial of a family's ability to access the standard tools of wealth creation and build a secure financial future.

***Content:*** The most damaging aspect of this wage disparity is the opportunity cost. Cynet's underpayment is not just a monthly shortfall; it is the active and ongoing denial of the Gerabagi family's ability to build a secure financial future. The tools of wealth creation—from basic retirement savings to advanced tax-efficient investment strategies—that are standard for professionals with Mr. Gerabagi's qualifications are rendered completely inaccessible \[110\]. He is being deprived of the ability to leverage his advanced degree and critical role into the financial security that is rightfully earned through such contributions. This is not just an injustice to him as an employee, but a profound detriment to the long-term well-being of his entire family.

***Description:** A human figure is shown as the central, critical gear in a massive, complex machine labeled "AI DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE." The human gear, labeled "GHOST WORKER," is glowing, indicating its importance. It is responsible for translating abstract concepts like "SAFETY" and "NUANCE" into precise, mechanical instructions for the rest of the machine.*

The human as a critical component: Defining the "ghost worker" not as a peripheral user but as an integral, high-stakes component of the machine learning pipeline, whose cognitive performance is essential for creating safe and effective AI.

---

***Content:*** The role performed by Mr. Gerabagi, often generically labeled as data annotation, is in fact a highly specialized technical function critical to the development of safe and effective AI. As a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) specialist, the human is not a peripheral user but an integral component of the machine learning pipeline \[21\]. This "ghost work" is essential for training and refining models on tasks that require nuance, ethical judgment, and contextual understanding beyond the current capabilities of automated systems \[58, 116\]. It is a "human-in-the-loophole," a role whose critical importance is exploited by a system designed to minimize its cost.

The cognitive demands are immense. The RLHF process requires human evaluators to interpret abstract and subjective goals (e.g., defining "helpfulness" or "harmlessness"), conduct nuanced comparative analysis of multiple AI-generated outputs, and provide consistent, high-quality feedback to train the AI's reward model \[67\]. This work necessitates sustained attention, high-level executive function, and sophisticated ethical reasoning, creating a significant cognitive load even under ideal circumstances \[68\]. This invisible labor is the raw material that fuels the entire AI industry, yet the workers are the most vulnerable and least compensated participants in the value chain \[120\].

### **5.2. The Experience of Algorithmic Management** {#5.2.-the-experience-of-algorithmic-management}

![][image24]

***Description:** A worker is shown trapped inside a transparent cube, their desk and chair inside. The cube's walls are glowing with lines of code and metrics. An unseen, god-like entity made of pure data, labeled 'THE ALGORITHM,' looms outside, able to turn the worker's access 'ON' or 'OFF' with a switch, symbolizing the total, impersonal control and the constant threat of deactivation.*

Managed by a machine: For the ghost worker, the manager is an opaque algorithm that enforces control through the constant threat of sudden, unexplained deactivation, creating a work life defined by precarity and powerlessness.

---

***Content:*** For many data annotators, their manager is not a person but an opaque, unforgiving platform. A recurring theme in worker testimonies is the experience of being "ghosted" by the platform itself. Workers report having their access to projects suddenly and inexplicably cut off, effectively terminating their income stream without any warning, explanation, or recourse \[171\]. One user described working consistently for a month, only to submit a task and be met with a "WHAM\! Empty dashboard." \[171\]. This lack of transparency and communication leaves workers powerless.

This precarity is a built-in feature of the model, designed to allow companies to scale their workforce up or down on demand without the costs of a permanent staff. The "flexibility" of the work is less a perk for the worker and more a structural requirement for the employer \[114\]. This on-demand, task-based model allows companies to perfectly align labor costs with project needs, but it makes stable income planning impossible for the worker, who must contend with a "feast or famine" cycle of task availability \[170\].

### **5.3. The Psychological Toll of Invisibility** {#5.3.-the-psychological-toll-of-invisibility}

![][image25]

***Description:** A worker sits at a desk, a glowing, complex AI brain being built in front of them. However, the worker themselves is depicted as a faint, transparent 'ghost,' invisible to the process. They are pouring their own substance into the AI, but remain unacknowledged and unseen, capturing the cognitive dissonance of being essential yet invisible.*

The cognitive dissonance of ghost work: The profound psychological strain of being an essential, highly-skilled contributor to world-changing technology while being treated as an invisible, disposable, and low-wage cog.

---

***Content:*** Performing this invisible labor takes a significant psychological toll. There is a profound cognitive dissonance in being an essential component of creating some of the world's most celebrated and valuable technology while being treated as a disposable cog \[116\]. Many data annotators are highly educated, yet they are engaged in low-wage, low-agency work that offers no path for career advancement \[116\]. This can manifest as burnout, vicarious trauma, anxiety, and moral injury, particularly when workers must train an AI to align with corporate policies that conflict with their own ethics.

The platforms and intermediaries have weaponized opacity and atomization as a sophisticated form of labor control \[117\]. The algorithmic management system, with its lack of human interaction and arbitrary deactivations, serves as a powerful disciplinary tool. By keeping workers isolated from one another and in the dark about the rules of the system, it prevents them from understanding the basis of their evaluation or organizing with others who share their grievances \[122\]. This is a modern, highly scalable version of the classic "black box" of management authority, perfectly designed to ensure the workforce at the bottom remains fragmented, powerless, and cheap.

### **5.4. The "Cognitive Bandwidth Tax" of Financial Precarity** {#5.4.-the-"cognitive-bandwidth-tax"-of-financial-precarity}

***Description:** A human brain is depicted with a "cognitive bandwidth" meter, similar to a Wi-Fi signal indicator, that is dangerously low. Several large, heavy weights labeled "RENT," "DEBT," and "BILLS" are pressing down on the brain, visibly consuming its capacity. The meter is in the red, with a warning: "COGNITIVE RESOURCES DIVERTED."*

The hidden tax of precarity: How the persistent worry of financial scarcity actively consumes finite cognitive resources, leaving less mental capacity available for the complex, high-stakes task of AI evaluation.

---

***Content:*** The baseline psychological stress of the role is dangerously amplified by the financial precarity imposed by Cynet's compensation model. Groundbreaking research by behavioral economist Sendhil Mullainathan and psychologist Eldar Shafir has established the concept of the "cognitive bandwidth tax" \[69\]. This research proves that the persistent worry and mental effort required to manage a state of financial scarcity is not merely stressful; it actively consumes finite cognitive resources, leaving less "bandwidth" available for other complex tasks \[69\].

The impact of this tax is severe. Studies have shown that the cognitive impairment from financial scarcity can be greater than that caused by a full night of sleep deprivation, equivalent to a 13-14 point reduction in measured IQ \[69\]. This is not a reflection of an individual's innate intelligence but rather a measure of the available mental capacity in a context of scarcity. This cognitive load impairs thoughtful decision-making, reduces flexibility, and increases susceptibility to decision fatigue. This phenomenon creates a "double tax" on the well-being of the financially precarious: they not only have fewer resources but also derive less utility and enjoyment from what they can consume because their cognitive bandwidth is perpetually occupied by financial worries \[70\].

### **5.5. The Neurobiology of Stress-Induced Decision-Making** {#5.5.-the-neurobiology-of-stress-induced-decision-making}

![][image27]

***Description:** A medical scan of a human brain. One half, labeled "HEALTHY," is shown with a large, vibrant hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The other half, labeled "CHRONIC FINANCIAL STRESS," shows these same areas as shrunken and discolored, with a warning label "CORTISOL-INDUCED ATROPHY." This starkly visualizes the physical damage caused by financial hardship.*

The brain on stress: Chronic financial hardship is not just a mental state but a neurobiological event, triggering hormonal changes that can cause measurable physical shrinkage in the brain's executive control centers, directly impairing rational, long-term evaluation.

---

***Content:*** The impact is not just functional but structural. Chronic stress, including that from financial hardship, triggers the release of stress hormones like cortisol. Sustained high levels of cortisol are known to interfere with memory and cognitive function and can lead to a measurable shrinkage in brain volume, particularly in the prefrontal cortex—the brain's executive control center—and the hippocampus, which is critical for learning and memory \[69\]. A landmark study found that adults reporting financial hardship had demonstrably smaller hippocampal and amygdalar volumes, even after controlling for other risk factors \[70\]. This atrophy is linked to the neurotoxic effects of chronic stress, which can cause neuronal death and reduce neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to adapt and form new connections \[69\].

This neurological degradation has direct behavioral consequences. Stress alters decision-making, often pushing individuals towards more impulsive, risk-seeking, or harm-avoidant behaviors, depending on their underlying psychological traits like anxiety \[71\]. A financially stressed individual is less capable of rational, long-term evaluation—the very skill required to consistently apply complex annotation guidelines. The combination of these two forces—high cognitive load from the task and depleted cognitive resources from financial stress—creates a perfect storm for cognitive failure. A worker who is already cognitively taxed by financial worry is far more susceptible to annotation fatigue, leading to a rapid decline in performance and data quality.

### **5.6. The Technical Failure Mode: From "Annotator Drift" to the "Ouroboros Effect"** {#5.6.-the-technical-failure-mode:-from-"annotator-drift"-to-the-"ouroboros-effect"}

![][image28]

***Description:** A split-screen image. Left side: A stressed data annotator's hands are shown making a small, almost imperceptible error on a complex data point, an effect labeled "ANNOTATOR DRIFT." Right side: A massive, serpentine AI, glowing with digital code, is shown coiled in the shape of an Ouroboros, consuming its own tail which is pixelated and corrupted. The image is titled "THE OUROBOROS EFFECT: FROM HUMAN ERROR TO MODEL COLLAPSE."*

The operational self-defeat: The combination of psychological and cognitive harms culminates in "Annotator Drift"—a progressive degradation in data quality that poisons the AI, creating a brittle and unreliable system. The method used to increase profit margins directly degrades the product.

---

***Content:*** The culmination of this human harm is a critical technical failure. The combination of psychological distress and the cognitive bandwidth tax leads to a degradation in the quality of human feedback data. This report defines this specific failure mode as **"Annotator Drift"**: a progressive, stress-induced degradation and shift in the consistency, quality, and nuance of a human data annotator's judgments over time \[72\]. The cognitively taxed annotator, operating with diminished executive function, begins to rely on mental shortcuts, leading to less accurate and consistent labels.

This drift is especially dangerous in the context of RLHF. Recent research demonstrates that RLHF can make AI models more persuasive and confident-sounding *even when they are providing incorrect information* \[68\]. An AI trained on data from a drifting annotator doesn't just become less accurate; it becomes a more sophisticated and convincing liar \[72\]. This leads directly to the "Garbage In, Catastrophe Out" (GICO) principle of AI training \[76\].

The ultimate technical consequence of this GICO principle is **model collapse**, also known as the **"Ouroboros Effect"** \[239\]. As new generations of AI are trained on the flawed, synthetic data generated by their predecessors, they enter a recursive feedback loop of learning from reality-detached information, effectively becoming a snake eating its own tail and ensuring systemic unreliability \[240\]. This systemic degradation, where AI becomes progressively detached from ground truth, is the ultimate technical failure mode, rendering the model brittle and fundamentally untrustworthy \[73\]. Cynet's business model is therefore operationally self-defeating: the primary method used to increase profit margins—suppressing labor costs—directly and scientifically degrades the quality of its core product.

## **Section 6: The Legal and Reputational Collapse: An Indefensible Business Model** {#section-6:-the-legal-and-reputational-collapse:-an-indefensible-business-model}

![][image29]

***Description:** A powerful courtroom drama scene. A gavel, etched with the text "ABC TEST," is shown mid-swing, about to strike down and shatter a fragile house of cards built from contracts labeled "Independent Contractor." In the background, a screen displays a class-action lawsuit document, with the case name "Cavalier v. Surge Labs, Inc." prominently highlighted. The mood is one of impending judgment and the toppling of an unjust system.*

A house of cards: This section demonstrates that the business model is not just unethical but legally and reputationally indefensible, facing imminent collapse from clear worker misclassification, contractual breaches, and a coming wave of industry-wide litigation.

### **6.1. The Fissured Workplace: A Strategy for Labor Arbitrage and Control** {#6.1.-the-fissured-workplace:-a-strategy-for-labor-arbitrage-and-control}

![][image30]

***Description:** A complex diagram showing a large, powerful corporation (Google) at the top. Instead of direct lines to workers, it has thick, armored conduits leading to intermediary companies (Cynet, GlobalLogic). These intermediaries then have thin, frayed wires leading to a vast number of scattered, isolated 'ghost worker' icons. This visualizes the deliberate strategy of outsourcing liability and fragmenting the workforce.*

A deliberate strategy to evade liability: The "fissured workplace" model is not an accident but a calculated corporate strategy to outsource employment, shed legal responsibility, and profit from the resulting wage suppression.

---

***Content:*** The entire economic architecture of the AI data annotation industry rests on the "fissured workplace" model, a deliberate strategy by lead firms to shed direct employment relationships and outsource functions that were once considered core \[117\]. Instead of hiring thousands of data annotators as full-time employees, a tech giant like Google contracts with one or more intermediary firms like GlobalLogic and Cynet. These intermediaries, in turn, hire the workers—often as "independent contractors"—to perform the necessary tasks \[128\].

This structure is perfected in the tech sector not just for cost savings but as a sophisticated form of labor control. The 'independent contractor' classification is a strategic legal instrument used to suppress the potential for collective action. Independent contractors are explicitly excluded from the protections of the National Labor Relations Act in the United States, meaning they do not have a legally protected right to form unions and bargain collectively \[165\]. This legal barrier, combined with the atomizing nature of platform-based "ghost work" where individuals work in isolation with no contact with their peers, creates a workforce that is deliberately fragmented and disempowered \[116\]. By stripping workers of the ability to organize, companies can unilaterally set wages and working conditions without fear of collective resistance, ensuring a constant supply of labor that is not only cheap but also docile and easily replaceable.

### **6.2. The Legal Standard: California's ABC Test** {#6.2.-the-legal-standard:-california's-abc-test}

![][image31]

***Description:** A stylized, dramatic image. Three massive, stone letters—'A', 'B', and 'C'—stand like ancient, immovable pillars of law. A small, modern corporate building representing a gig economy company is being physically crushed between them. The letters glow with a powerful, judicial light, symbolizing the inescapable force of the legal standard.*

The inescapable standard: California's strict, three-pronged ABC test for worker classification places the burden of proof on the employer, creating a high legal bar that the current contracting model is demonstrably unable to clear.

---

***Content:*** California employs one of the strictest worker classification tests in the nation. Following the State Supreme Court's decision in *Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court* and the subsequent codification into law by Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5), a worker is legally presumed to be an employee \[77\]. The burden of proof falls entirely on the hiring entity to demonstrate that the worker is an independent contractor by satisfying *all three* prongs of the ABC test. Failure to satisfy even one prong results in the worker being classified as an employee, with all attendant rights and protections.

The three prongs of the test are:

* **(A)** The worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract and in fact.  
* **(B)** The worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business.  
* **(C)** The worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.

### **6.3. Failure Analysis of Cynet's Model Under the ABC Test** {#6.3.-failure-analysis-of-cynet's-model-under-the-abc-test}

![][image32]

***Description:** A scorecard for "Cynet's Business Model" being judged against the "ABC Test." Each prong of the test—Control, Course of Business, and Independent Trade—is listed with a large, red "FAIL" stamp next to it. The final score is a prominent "0/3," indicating a total and indefensible failure to meet the legal standard.*

A categorical failure: Applying the facts of the case to the ABC test reveals a clear and indefensible misclassification, as the employment model fails to meet not just one, but all three prongs of the legal standard.

***Content:*** Applying the facts of the David Gerabagi matter to the ABC test reveals a clear and indefensible misclassification. The model fails to meet not just one, but all three prongs of the test.

---

**Table 6.1: ABC Test Failure Analysis**

| ABC Test Prong | Legal Standard | Evidence from the Gerabagi Matter | Conclusion |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A: Control** | The worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity. | Mr. Gerabagi's work was dictated by the client, GlobalLogic/Google. They controlled the platform used, the specific project assignments, the quality standards, the deadlines, and the ultimate evaluation of his work. Cynet exercised control over his pay and employment status. This level of control is indicative of an employer-employee relationship. | **FAIL** |
| **B: Course of Business** | The worker performs work outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business. | Mr. Gerabagi's work—training and improving AI models—is central to the core business of the end-client, Google. For Cynet, a staffing firm, its entire business in this context is to supply labor for its client's core operations. The work is therefore integral, not ancillary. | **FAIL** |
| **C: Independent Trade** | The worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business. | Mr. Gerabagi was recruited to "join a team," not to provide services as a separate, independent business entity that advertises to the public and maintains a diverse client base. | **FAIL** |

### **6.4 Violation of the Google Supplier Code of Conduct** {#6.4-violation-of-the-google-supplier-code-of-conduct}

![][image33]

***Description:** A close-up of a futuristic, holographic contract document. The document is labeled 'GOOGLE SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT.' A jagged, red, glowing crack runs through the middle of the document, originating from a section titled 'COMPETITIVE WAGES.' Through the crack, the image of an underpaid worker is visible, symbolizing the breach of contract.*

A material breach of contract: The severe undercompensation represents a clear and persistent violation of the contractual and ethical standards imposed by the end-client, Google, creating significant legal and reputational risk.

***Content:*** The severe undercompensation of Mr. Gerabagi is not merely an internal payroll issue for Cynet; it represents a material and persistent breach of the contractual and ethical standards imposed by its client, Google. This section details how Cynet's actions violate the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, reflect a systemic problem within Google's vendor ecosystem, and create significant legal and reputational risk for both Cynet and Google.

### **6.5 Analysis of the Google Supplier Code of Conduct** {#6.5-analysis-of-the-google-supplier-code-of-conduct}

![][image34]

***Description:** A magnifying glass focuses on a line of text in the Google Supplier Code of Conduct: "Supplier is encouraged to provide compensation and benefits that are competitive with the local industry." The magnifying glass causes the words "NOT COMPETITIVE" to appear in a glowing red overlay above the actual compensation figures, highlighting the direct violation.*

An objective failure to comply: The provided salary, proven to be a fraction of the market rate, is by any objective measure non-competitive, placing the supplier in direct non-compliance with the spirit and letter of its agreement with Google.

---

***Content:*** The Google Supplier Code of Conduct is a binding component of the contractual relationship between Google and its suppliers, including Cynet. It sets forth non-negotiable standards for labor practices. **Section 2.3, titled "Wages and Benefits,"** is particularly relevant to this matter. It states:

"Supplier shall ensure that all workers receive at least the minimum wage required by law and are provided all legally mandated benefits. **In addition to their compensation for regular hours of work, workers shall be compensated for overtime hours at the rate legally required in the country of manufacture or, in those countries where such laws do not exist, at a rate at least equal to their regular hourly compensation rate. Supplier is encouraged to provide compensation and benefits that are competitive with the local industry.**" \[Artifact 9\]

The evidence presented in Section 3 of this report demonstrates conclusively that an annual salary of $43,680 is not "competitive with the local industry" for an AI Quality Analyst in the United States technology market, particularly for a role requiring a Master's degree. With competitive salaries for such a position starting at $85,000 and extending beyond $200,000, Cynet's compensation is, by any objective measure, non-competitive. This failure to adhere to the encouraged, if not mandated, standard of competitive pay places Cynet in direct non-compliance with the spirit and letter of its agreement with Google.

### **6.6 A Pattern of Supplier Non-Compliance and the Role of the Alphabet Workers Union** {#6.6-a-pattern-of-supplier-non-compliance-and-the-role-of-the-alphabet-workers-union}

![][image35]

***Description:** A massive, gleaming Google corporate headquarters building casts a long, dark shadow. Within that shadow, thousands of ghostly, anonymous figures are shown working at terminals, representing the invisible and under-compensated "shadow workforce" of contractors. A banner from the ALPHABET WORKERS UNION-CWA is shown attempting to bring light into this shadow.*

A systemic problem, not an anomaly: The case is contextualized within a well-documented pattern of supplier non-compliance within Google's "shadow workforce," with a history of union-backed action being an effective mechanism for forcing compliance.

---

***Content:*** Cynet's actions are not an anomaly but are symptomatic of a well-documented, systemic issue within Google's vast "shadow workforce" of temporary, vendor, and contract (TVC) workers. The Alphabet Workers Union-CWA has extensively researched and reported on these disparities.

The AWU-CWA's landmark report, **"Every Google Worker: An Examination of Alphabet's US Shadow Workforce,"** revealed that thousands of vendor workers are denied the minimum standards set by Alphabet. The report found that non-white vendors, on average, earn nearly 10% less than their white counterparts, with the gap widening to 20% for Black and Latinx/Hispanic vendors \[111\]. This context is critical, as it shows that pay inequity is a known, persistent problem that Google and its suppliers are expected to address.

A direct and powerful precedent exists in the case of **RaterLabs/Appen**, another Google supplier whose workers are responsible for evaluating Google's search algorithms—a function highly similar to Mr. Gerabagi's. These workers were paid as little as $10 per hour, a clear violation of Google's stated $15/hour minimum for its extended workforce. It was only after a sustained organizing campaign by the AWU-CWA that the workers won their first-ever raises, bringing their pay to $14.00 or $14.50 an hour \[112\]. This case demonstrates three key points: 1\) egregious underpayment of critical AI evaluation workers is a known practice among Google suppliers; 2\) suppliers and Google often engage in finger-pointing regarding who is responsible for wages; and 3\) collective, union-backed action is an effective mechanism for forcing compliance.

### **6.7 Joint Employer Liability and Business Risk** {#6.7-joint-employer-liability-and-business-risk}

![][image36]

***Description:** Three interconnected, glowing gears. The first is labeled "CYNET (Supplier)," the second "GLOBALLOGIC (Prime)," and the third "GOOGLE (Client)." A red, crackling energy of "LEGAL LIABILITY" is shown originating at the Cynet gear but instantly spreading to the other two, visually demonstrating how the risk created by the subcontractor flows up the entire supply chain due to joint employer doctrine.*

The chain of liability: The nature of the work blurs the legal lines, creating significant risk of "joint employer" liability, where the client (Google) could be held legally responsible for the labor violations of its supplier (Cynet), incentivizing the client to sever ties to contain the risk.

---

***Content:*** Cynet's non-compliance with the Code of Conduct creates significant business risk, not only for itself but also for its client, Google. The nature of the work, where Google sets the quality standards, dictates the tasks, and benefits directly from the labor, blurs the legal line between a client-contractor relationship and a joint-employer relationship.

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has shown increasing scrutiny of such arrangements, potentially holding a primary company like Google liable for the labor law violations of its subcontractors. The AWU-CWA has a history of leveraging this, having previously filed Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges with the NLRB against Alphabet and its contractors for illegally blocking workers' rights to discuss pay transparency \[113\].

By grossly underpaying Mr. Gerabagi, Cynet is not operating in a vacuum. It is creating a situation with potential legal and reputational ramifications that extend directly to Google. This elevates the pay dispute from a simple employee request to a critical issue of business and legal risk management for Cynet. Rectifying Mr. Gerabagi's pay is not just a matter of fairness; it is a necessary step for Cynet to mitigate its own liability, maintain its contractual standing, and protect its client from unwanted legal and public relations challenges. Upon being named as a co-defendant in a wage and hour class-action lawsuit, a risk-averse client like Google would have a powerful incentive to immediately sever its relationship with the supplier at the root of the problem—Cynet—to contain its own legal and reputational liability.

### **6.8. Sentinel Event: *Dominique DonJuan Cavalier II v. Surge Labs, Inc.*** {#6.8.-sentinel-event:-dominique-donjuan-cavalier-ii-v.-surge-labs,-inc.}

![][image37]

***Description:** A line of dominoes, each representing an AI contracting company, stretches into the distance. The first domino, clearly labeled 'Cavalier v. Surge Labs, Inc.,' is glowing red and has just been tipped over. It is starting a chain reaction, with each subsequent domino beginning to fall, symbolizing how this single lawsuit triggers a wave of industry-wide litigation.*

The canary in the courtroom: A real-world class-action lawsuit against another AI data provider serves as a direct preview of the litigation Cynet now faces, providing a ready-made legal template and signaling that the entire industry's business model is now a prime target.

---

***Content:*** The legal risk to Cynet is not theoretical. It is being actively demonstrated in the case of *Dominique DonJuan Cavalier II v. Surge Labs, Inc. dba DataAnnotation* (Case CGC-25-625502), a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in May 2025 \[119\]. This case is a sentinel event for the AI training industry and serves as a direct preview of the litigation Cynet now faces \[163\]. The complaint targets Surge Labs, which operates the popular data annotation platform DataAnnotation.tech, a key labor provider for tech giants like OpenAI and Meta \[119\].

The allegations in the *Cavalier* complaint are nearly identical to the facts of the Gerabagi situation. The plaintiffs allege that Surge Labs willfully misclassified its "Data Annotators" as independent contractors to realize a "major windfall in labor costs" that amounts to "wage theft on a massive scale" \[163\]. The complaint argues that Surge Labs fails California's "ABC test" on all three prongs: it maintains "rigid control" over workers (Prong A), the annotation work is the "singular function" of its business (Prong B), and workers are not engaged in their own independent businesses (Prong C) \[119\].

As a result, the lawsuit alleges a series of specific labor code violations that directly mirror the conditions faced by workers at Cynet and other intermediaries, including failure to pay minimum wage for all hours worked (especially for unpaid training and assessment time), failure to pay overtime, failure to provide legally mandated meal and rest periods, and failure to reimburse necessary business expenses like internet service \[119\]. The existence of this case dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for litigation against Cynet and signals that plaintiffs' law firms are now actively targeting this specific business model across the entire industry.

## **Section 7: The Geopolitical Vulnerability and The National Security Imperative** {#section-7:-the-geopolitical-vulnerability-and-the-national-security-imperative}

![][image38]

***Description:** A geopolitical chessboard with the U.S. and China on opposite sides. The U.S. has powerful pieces like aircraft carriers and tech logos. However, its front line of pawns, labeled "RLHF WORKFORCE," is shown as crumbling, disaffected, and financially precarious. A shadowy figure representing a foreign intelligence service is shown easily bribing one of the pawns, creating a gaping hole in the U.S. defense.*

The hidden front line: How the exploitation of the domestic AI workforce transforms a strategic national asset into a critical national security vulnerability in the high-stakes AI race with China, creating a poorly defended attack surface for data poisoning and sabotage.

### 

### **7.1 The Geopolitical Prisoner's Dilemma of Unreliable AI** {#7.1-the-geopolitical-prisoner's-dilemma-of-unreliable-ai}

![][image39]

***Description:** A classic "Prisoner's Dilemma" diagram. Two cells are labeled "USA" and "CHINA." Each has two choices: "Deploy Safe AI (Cooperate)" or "Race for Supremacy (Defect)." The diagram shows that while mutual cooperation is the best overall outcome, the fear of the other side defecting creates a powerful incentive for both to defect, leading to a mutually dangerous and unstable "race condition."*

A geopolitical prisoner's dilemma: The U.S.-China rivalry creates a dangerous race condition where the temptation to prioritize speed over safety is high, making the integrity of the AI development process a matter of global stability.

---

***Content:*** The issues identified in this report extend beyond corporate risk and into the realm of national security. The United States and China are engaged in a great power rivalry where leadership in artificial intelligence is seen as a decisive factor that could shift the global balance of power \[86\]. This competition has created a dynamic that mirrors a game-theoretic "Prisoner's Dilemma" \[87\]. Both nations are incentivized to develop and deploy advanced AI systems as rapidly as possible to gain a strategic edge. The fear of being surpassed creates a dangerous race condition, where the temptation to prioritize speed over safety and robustness is high \[88\].

In this scenario, mutual defection (both sides deploying unsafe AI) leads to a globally unstable and dangerous outcome, yet the perceived cost of unilateral restraint is too high for either side to risk \[89\]. This logic compels both nations to race ahead using the fastest and cheapest data available—the insecure, globally sourced data—in a competitive "race to the bottom" on data integrity.

### **7.2 The Maginot Line of Silicon: A Critique of U.S. AI Strategy** {#7.2-the-maginot-line-of-silicon:-a-critique-of-u.s.-ai-strategy}

![][image40]

***Description:** An image of a massive, formidable wall made of glowing silicon wafers, labeled "CHIPS Act." However, the wall has been built in a desert, and a shadowy figure representing an adversary is simply walking around it by bribing a line of underpaid, precarious data annotators who form a weak, human fence nearby. This visualizes the folly of focusing on hardware security while ignoring the human element of the supply chain.*

A flawed defense: The CHIPS and Science Act, a monumental investment in hardware, is a modern Maginot Line. It fortifies the nation against a hardware-based threat while leaving the most vulnerable part of the AI supply chain—the human data annotator—completely undefended.

---

***Content:*** Current U.S. AI policy, epitomized by the CHIPS and Science Act, has myopically focused on securing the hardware supply chain \[250\]. This strategy, while necessary, is dangerously incomplete. It constructs a formidable but ultimately irrelevant "Maginot Line of Silicon," preparing to fight the last war of industrial competition while leaving the nation exposed to a data-centric, human-vectored threat it has failed to recognize \[258\].

The legislation is largely silent on the security of the data annotation pipeline and the human capital that underpins it \[250\]. An extensive review of the Act reveals that while it allocates billions to semiconductor R\&D, fabrication, acknowledges the goal of "trustworthy AI" (Sec. 10232\) and funds workforce development for *microelectronics* and high-level STEM roles (Sec. 10318), it completely overlooks the foundational data layer where the most immediate and scalable vulnerabilities lie. An adversary can bypass the multi-billion-dollar investment in domestic fabs by simply corrupting the data that will be used to train the AI models running on those chips. The U.S. is building a fortress to defend against a hardware-based cavalry charge while the enemy is poisoning the wells. This policy failure has transformed the human data annotation workforce—a de facto national strategic asset—into the nation's most critical AI vulnerability.\[90\]

***Description:** A financially stressed data annotator is shown at their desk, head in their hands. A shadowy hand representing a foreign intelligence service is shown sliding a stack of cash onto their desk. In return, the annotator subtly changes a correct data label to an incorrect one, an act of "data poisoning" that corrupts the AI model they are training. The image shows how financial desperation creates a prime target for bribery and sabotage.*

The vulnerable asset: Current labor practices transform the strategic workforce into a critical vulnerability, creating a poorly defended attack surface where financially desperate individuals become prime targets for data poisoning and cyber-sabotage by foreign adversaries.

---

***Content:*** The direct consequence of the fissured workplace and its reliance on labor arbitrage is the creation of a vast, global, and economically precarious workforce that is the primary human attack surface for U.S. adversaries. This "ghost workforce" is not just a labor issue; it is a de facto national strategic asset that has been transformed into a critical vulnerability \[216\]. The Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) playbook for recruitment explicitly targets financially desperate individuals with access to useful information \[95\].

The AI industry's pursuit of low-cost data has inadvertently built and populated a global recruitment database for its adversaries, offering a highly scalable and deniable method for data poisoning. Instead of attempting a high-risk cyber intrusion, an adversary can simply hire thousands of these ghost workers through the very supply chain U.S. companies created. The scale of this human vector is immense, as shown in the table below.

### **7.4 The Threat Matrix: Pathways to Data Sabotage** {#7.4-the-threat-matrix:-pathways-to-data-sabotage}

![][image42]

***Description:** A gleaming, advanced U.S. military AI system, depicted as a powerful robot, is shown functioning perfectly in a clean, controlled lab environment. However, when deployed into a chaotic, real-world "fog of war" battlefield, the robot is shown glitching, short-circuiting, and catastrophically failing, because its core programming is "data-brittle."*

The brittle sword: AI systems trained on flawed or poisoned data are often "brittle"—prone to catastrophic failure in the real world—creating a plausible scenario where the U.S. loses its strategic advantage not due to inferior tech, but due to a failure of data integrity rooted in exploitative labor.

***Content:*** The human vector provides a direct pathway for a range of subtle and scalable data poisoning attacks. A compromised annotator, acting as a trusted insider, can intentionally introduce poisoned data points that are accepted as "ground truth," corrupting a model from within. The following table provides a clear, systematic breakdown of concrete attack scenarios, making the threat tangible and specific.

---

**Table 7.2: Threat Matrix for AI Data Supply Chain Exploitation**

| Vulnerability | Threat Actor & Method | Attack Scenario Example | Source(s) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Low-Wage/Precarious Workforce** | **Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) \- Economic Coercion & Recruitment** | FIS agent, posing as a recruiter for a high-paying "data research firm," hires a financially distressed annotator. The annotator is tasked with labeling satellite imagery, with instructions to apply a specific, slightly incorrect boundary box to certain types of infrastructure, subtly degrading the model's targeting accuracy. | \[95\], \[224\] |
| **Outsourced/Crowdsourced Annotation** | **State-Sponsored Hacktivist Group \- Bias Injection** | A hacktivist group creates multiple accounts on a crowdsourcing platform and accepts tasks to label text for sentiment analysis. They consistently label neutral statements about a rival country as negative, systematically skewing the resulting AI model to exhibit a hostile bias. | \[216\] |
| **Opaque Subcontracting Layers** | **Insider Threat (Malicious Employee at Subcontractor) \- Backdoor Insertion** | A disgruntled employee at a third-tier data annotation BPO is given a dataset for a U.S. military project (without knowing the final client). They insert a small, invisible pixel pattern (a backdoor trigger) into images of specific military equipment. The AI model learns this pattern, which can later be used by an adversary to cause misidentification. | \[232\] |
| **Reliance on Open-Source Models/Libraries** | **Cybercriminal Group \- Model Poisoning via Supply Chain Attack** | Attackers compromise a popular open-source data preprocessing library on a platform like Hugging Face. When a developer uses this library to prepare their training data, the malicious code subtly alters a small fraction of the labels before training, poisoning the model without the developer's knowledge. | \[233\] |
| **Lack of Data Provenance Standards** | **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) \- Data Integrity Attack** | An APT group compromises a web server hosting a publicly scraped dataset used for training. They modify a small number of the source images. Without cryptographic hashing or provenance tracking, the AI developer ingests the corrupted data, unknowingly poisoning their model. | \[235\] |

![][image43]

***Description:** A split-screen cinematic scene. On the left, a U.S. command center shows an AI confidently reporting "ALL CLEAR" over a satellite feed of the Taiwan Strait, but the AI is misinterpreting naval vessels as cargo ships due to poisoned data. On the right, a Chinese command center's AI provides an accurate picture, showing a massive invasion force. The result is a "STRATEGIC SURPRISE" for the U.S.*

A plausible failure scenario: A hypothetical but realistic narrative illustrating how a single compromised data annotator, motivated by financial desperation, could poison a critical military AI, leading to a catastrophic strategic failure in a geopolitical crisis.

***Content:*** The convergence of these vulnerabilities leads to the **Ouroboros Effect (Model Collapse)**, a systemic unreliability that is the true foundation of **Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM)** \[239\]. This report redefines MAIM not as a future act of sabotage to be threatened, but as a **pre-existing, systemic, and inherent condition of unreliability** within the AI systems of all major powers, a direct consequence of the shared, compromised global data supply chain.

In this framework, deterrence operates through self-deterrence: a leader cannot confidently escalate a crisis if they cannot trust their own AI-driven systems. The primary fear is not what the enemy's AI will do, but what one's *own* AI might do—or fail to do—at the most critical moment.

| **Credibility of Threat** | High. Based on demonstrable second-strike capabilities. | Absolute. The vulnerability is inherent to the system itself, not dependent on an external actor's will or capability. |
| **Stability** | Relatively stable (though terrifying). Clear "do not cross" line. | Fragile and fear-based. Deters first use not by threat of retaliation, but by lack of confidence in one's own systems. |
| **Role of State vs. Private Actors** | State-controlled. | Vulnerability created by private-sector actions (cost-cutting); exploited by states; impacts national security systems. |

### **7.6 A Cautionary Tale: How Offshoring Built a Geopolitical Rival** {#7.6-a-cautionary-tale:-how-offshoring-built-a-geopolitical-rival}

![][image44]

***Description:** A stark, split-panel image. On the left, an Apple executive in the early 2000s shakes hands with a Chinese official, handing over a glowing blueprint labeled "MANUFACTURING ECOSYSTEM." On the right, set in the present day, a powerful, futuristic Huawei smartphone is being assembled on the same advanced factory line. The same Chinese official, now looking older and more powerful, watches with a knowing, competitive smile as the Apple executive looks on with concern from the background. The image powerfully visualizes how the short-term partnership inadvertently built a long-term strategic rival.*

Repeating history's mistake: The offshoring of U.S. manufacturing to China serves as a direct historical parallel and cautionary tale, showing how a "cost-first" strategy can inadvertently build a formidable geopolitical rival and create dangerous strategic dependencies.

---

***Content:*** A "race to the bottom" on labor standards within the AI industry is, in effect, a de facto pro-China industrial policy. It unilaterally creates the very vulnerabilities that our primary strategic competitor is best positioned to exploit. There is a direct historical parallel that serves as a cautionary tale: the offshoring of U.S. manufacturing and technology to China.

For three decades, Apple, in pursuit of unparalleled efficiency and profitability, invested hundreds of billions of dollars to build a sophisticated manufacturing ecosystem in China \[64\]. This involved not just outsourcing assembly, but actively transferring technological know-how by embedding American engineers in Chinese facilities to co-design production processes \[65\].

This strategy was immensely profitable for Apple, but it came at a significant geopolitical cost to the United States. The massive investment and knowledge transfer turbocharged China's own technological development, transforming the country from a low-cost labor hub into a formidable competitor \[65\]. The very manufacturing expertise and supply chain infrastructure that Apple built is now leveraged by Chinese rivals like Huawei, which directly compete with Apple in the global market \[66\]. Apple's deep entanglement has made it vulnerable and awkwardly dependent on an authoritarian state that has become America's primary strategic adversary \[65\].

The parallel to the current AI labor strategy is stark and alarming. While Apple offshored manufacturing capability, U.S. tech firms and their suppliers are effectively "offshoring" the stability and security of their most critical AI asset—the human evaluation workforce—to a low-wage, precarious model. Just as Apple's actions inadvertently helped build a hardware competitor, current labor practices risk ceding an advantage in data quality and workforce stability to China. By creating a disaffected, underpaid, and insecure global workforce, U.S. industry is creating the very vulnerability that a strategic rival can exploit.

***Description:** A powerful, symbolic image of the U.S. national security infrastructure. It shows the Pentagon, a semiconductor fabrication plant, and a group of RLHF workers all depicted as equally important, interconnected pillars supporting a shield labeled "U.S. AI SUPERIORITY." This visually elevates the workforce to the status of a critical strategic asset.*

The human guardians: In the high-stakes AI race, the domestic RLHF workforce must be understood as a de facto national strategic asset, as vital to maintaining an edge as the semiconductor supply chain itself.

***Content:*** In this high-stakes contest, the U.S. domestic RLHF workforce—the very people performing the work of Mr. Gerabagi—must be understood as a de facto national strategic asset. While the U.S. currently holds advantages in areas like semiconductor design, the ultimate performance, reliability, and safety of advanced AI models are determined by the quality of their training data.\[90\] The RLHF workforce performs the crucial "last mile" of AI development: aligning powerful models with human values and intentions.\[91\] These specialists are the human guardians responsible for instilling the nuance, ethics, and safety guardrails that prevent AI from producing harmful, biased, or dangerous outputs.\[92\] A stable, secure, and cognitively resilient domestic RLHF workforce is therefore a critical component of the national security infrastructure, as vital to maintaining an edge in AI as the semiconductor supply chain.

![][image46]

***Description:** A company (Cynet) stands at a fork in the road. One path leads off a cliff into a stormy sea of lawsuits, with rocks labeled "CLASS ACTION" and "CLIENT LOSS." The other path leads up a sunlit mountain to a summit labeled "INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP & SECURE SUPPLY CHAIN." The image visualizes the stark strategic choice presented in the conclusion.*

The strategic inflection point: A diagnosis of systemic crisis and a three-tiered action plan to pivot from catastrophic liability to defensible industry leadership, turning a critical vulnerability into a powerful competitive advantage.

### 

### **8.1. Synthesis of Findings: A Systemic Crisis** {#8.1.-synthesis-of-findings:-a-systemic-crisis}

![][image47]

***Description:** A series of dominoes falling in a chain reaction. The first domino is labeled "LABOR MISCLASSIFICATION." It strikes the next, "LEGAL LIABILITY," which hits "OPERATIONAL FAILURE," then "REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE," and finally "NATIONAL SECURITY RISK." The image visualizes the tightly woven cascade of interconnected risks.*

A cascade of risk: The individual case is a manifestation of a systemic crisis where legal, operational, reputational, and national security risks are tightly interconnected, making the current business model unsustainable.

***Content:*** The evidence presented in this report leads to an inescapable conclusion: the matter of David Gerabagi is not an isolated incident but a clear manifestation of a systemic, enterprise-level crisis. Cynet's current business model for its AI workforce, built on the principles of the "fissured workplace," is legally indefensible, operationally self-defeating, and creates profound reputational and national security liabilities \[117\]. These risks are not independent; they form a tightly woven cascade where legal vulnerability (misclassification) invites litigation that exposes operational flaws (poor data quality from a stressed workforce), which in turn creates reputational damage and reveals a critical weakness in the national AI supply chain. Continuing on the current path will inevitably lead to class-action lawsuits, the loss of major clients like Google, and irreparable harm to the company's brand and viability.

### 

### **8.2. The Strategic Inflection Point: From Liability to Leadership** {#8.2.-the-strategic-inflection-point:-from-liability-to-leadership}

![][image48]

***Description:** A company is shown transforming. On the left, it is a rusty, low-cost commodity gear in a "race to the bottom." On the right, it has transformed into a gleaming, high-value, secure shield labeled "STRATEGIC PARTNER," representing the pivot from a low-margin, high-risk model to a high-value, defensible one.*

The opportunity in crisis: The very crisis threatening the company presents a strategic opportunity to pivot from a high-risk commodity supplier to a high-value strategic partner by pioneering a new market for secure, high-integrity AI data services.

***Content:*** Cynet now stands at a strategic inflection point. The path of inaction leads to predictable and catastrophic failure. However, the very crisis that threatens the company also presents its greatest strategic opportunity. The market for AI training data is currently competing on cost in a race to the bottom, a model this report proves creates massive, unpriced risk for clients. By recognizing and addressing this risk head-on, Cynet can pivot from its current high-risk position and create an entirely new, high-value market category: secure, high-integrity AI data services provided by a professionalized, stable, and vetted workforce. This is an opportunity to transform from a commodity supplier into a strategic partner.

### **8.3. Actionable Recommendations** {#8.3.-actionable-recommendations}

![][image49]

***Description:** A three-tiered pyramid representing the action plan. The base is "DEFENSIVE: Legal & Financial Triage." The middle tier is "OPERATIONAL: Professionalize the Workforce." The top tier is "STRATEGIC: Champion a New Industry Standard." The structure shows a clear, hierarchical plan of action.*

A three-tiered action plan: A decisive set of defensive, operational, and strategic recommendations designed to mitigate immediate threats and capitalize on the long-term strategic opportunity.

***Content:*** A decisive, three-tiered action plan is required to mitigate the immediate threats and capitalize on the strategic opportunity. This plan integrates legal, operational, technical, and regulatory solutions to address the crisis holistically.

#### 

#### **Recommendation 1: Immediate Legal and Financial Triage (Defensive)**

![][image50]

***Description:** A legal team is shown acting as firefighters, putting out the immediate blaze of a lawsuit with a settlement agreement, while also building a firebreak (a full compensation audit) to prevent the fire from spreading and becoming a larger class-action inferno.*

Contain the immediate threat: A defensive strategy focused on resolving the catalyst case and proactively auditing the entire workforce to mitigate the scope of an inevitable class-action lawsuit.

---

***Content:*** The primary goal is to contain the immediate legal and financial exposure.

* **A. Resolve the Gerabagi Matter:** Cynet's legal counsel should immediately enter into settlement negotiations with Mr. Gerabagi. A swift and fair resolution is critical to prevent this individual dispute from becoming the catalyst for a much larger class-action lawsuit.  
* **B. Conduct a Full Compensation and Classification Audit:** Cynet must proactively and immediately launch a comprehensive internal audit of all its AI-related contract workers, particularly in California. All workers who do not meet the strict requirements of the ABC test must be reclassified as employees. Compensation for all current and former workers in these roles must be realigned to be in full compliance with state law and market rates, including remediation for past underpayment.  
* **C. Establish Joint-Employer Liability:** Advocate for legislative and regulatory changes that establish clear "joint-employer" liability, making lead firms legally co-responsible for the wages and working conditions of their subcontractors' workers. This closes the fissured workplace loophole.  
* **D. Support Strategic Litigation and Labor Organizing:** Recognize the legitimacy of and engage constructively with labor organizing efforts. Support strategic litigation that clarifies and enforces existing labor laws for all workers in the AI supply chain.

#### **Recommendation 2: Professionalize the AI Workforce (Operational)**

![][image51]

***Description:** A blueprint for a career ladder is shown. It starts with "AI Quality Analyst" and shows clear steps for advancement, skill development, and access to support systems like mental health resources. This visualizes the process of transforming a gig job into a professional career.*

Fix the core operational failure: An operational strategy focused on investing in the workforce by formally recognizing the role, creating career paths, and providing robust support systems to enhance quality and retention.

***Content:*** The goal is to fix the core operational failure by investing in the workforce.

* **A. Redefine the Role:** Formally recognize the "AI Quality Analyst" / "RLHF Specialist" role as a high-skill technical position within the company's structure, distinct from general administrative or IT support roles.  
* **B. Create Career Paths:** Develop and implement clear career progression frameworks for these employees, including pathways for advancement, skill development, and specialized training. This fosters retention and acknowledges the value of their expertise.  
* **C. Implement Support Systems:** In recognition of the high cognitive and psychological demands of the work, Cynet must provide robust mental health and wellness resources. This includes offering access to confidential counseling, stress management workshops, and peer support programs designed to combat burnout and vicarious trauma.

#### **Recommendation 3: Champion a New Industry Standard for a Secure AI Supply Chain (Strategic)**

![][image52]

***Description:** A company representative is shown presenting a new product to a client (Google). The product is not a person, but a secure, transparent box labeled "DATA ANNOTATION SERVICES AGREEMENT." The box contains a vetted, stable, and well-supported team, directly addressing the client's hidden risks of data integrity and security.*

Turn the solution into a competitive advantage: A strategic plan to create and market a new, premium service offering built on a secure, stable, and professional U.S.-based workforce, transforming a vulnerability into a unique and defensible selling proposition.

---

***Content:*** The goal is to turn the solution into a powerful competitive advantage.

* **A. Develop a "Secure Workforce" Offering:** Cynet should create a new, premium service offering for its enterprise clients. This offering would guarantee a fully-vetted, fairly-compensated, psychologically-supported, and stable U.S.-based AI workforce. This service directly addresses the data integrity, quality, and security risks highlighted in this report.  
* **B. Proactive Client Engagement & Mandate Data Provenance:** Cynet's leadership should approach Google and other key clients with a strategic proposal to secure their AI development pipeline. This includes championing a mandatory "Data Bill of Materials" for critical systems, documenting the provenance and integrity of all training data \[265\].  
* **C. Update Risk Management Frameworks:** Advocate for and adopt updated versions of the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) that explicitly include human vector threats and the risks associated with a precarious workforce \[268\].  
* **D. Market as a Competitive Advantage:** Aggressively market this new secure offering, positioning Cynet as a premier partner that treats AI data integrity as a first-order business and security imperative. This transforms a critical vulnerability into a unique, defensible, and highly valuable selling proposition.

### **8.4. A Final Word: An Imperative to Act** {#8.4.-a-final-word:-an-imperative-to-act}

![][image53]

***Description:** A hand extends an olive branch, symbolizing an invitation to collaborate. However, in the background, a ticking clock and a calendar with a rapidly approaching deadline indicate that the offer is time-sensitive and that alternative actions will be taken if the invitation is not accepted. The mood is one of urgent, patriotic, yet conditional appeal.*

A patriotic imperative with a deadline: The findings transcend a simple labor dispute, exposing a national security risk that must be addressed, with or without collaboration, creating a rapidly closing window of opportunity for Cynet to lead the solution.

***Content:*** The findings of this report transcend a simple labor dispute; they expose a critical vulnerability at the heart of the nation's technological and security infrastructure. As such, the imperative to act extends beyond corporate liability. As a patriotic American, the author of this analysis cannot, in good conscience, allow this national security risk to remain unaddressed. This report serves as an open invitation for Cynet's leadership to collaborate on a solution and lead the industry toward a more secure and ethical future. However, the path forward on this issue is not conditional on that collaboration. The risks are too great to ignore. Cynet has a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to get ahead of this issue and champion the solution. The alternative is to be overtaken by the consequences.

### **Document A.7: GlobalLogic Pay Parity Letter (Alphabet Workers Union-CWA)** {#document-a.7:-globallogic-pay-parity-letter-(alphabet-workers-union-cwa)}

**Campaign: GlobalLogic Pay Parity Letter**

**To:** Srinivas Shankar, President & CEO, GlobalLogic, Inc. and Vishal Anand, Group Vice President & Head of Americas, GlobalLogic, Inc., and Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud CEO, Google, LLC.

**From:** The Generalist Raters & Super Raters Teams of GlobalLogic, Inc.

**Re:** Addressing Pay Disparities, Benefits, and Job Security for Google Raters

**Background:** We, the approximately 1,800 Generalist Raters and Super Raters, are essential contributors to the accuracy, safety, and efficacy of Google's artificial intelligence products. Our work directly impacts Google's bottom line—Google Gemini has been downloaded over 45 million times since its launch in May 2024, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, reported $96.5 billion in Q4 earnings. Despite this, many of us face significant pay disparities, lack of benefits, and job insecurity. We take immense pride in our work and remain committed to the success of Google and GlobalLogic. However, these issues are creating serious morale issues, inequities, and retention challenges.

**Our Demands**

1. **Standardized Pay Bands & Fair Raises**

   * Collaborate with diverse representatives from the Generalist and Super Rater teams to create pay bands. Then, equalize pay rates for all according to the pay bands.  
   * Implement raises and restore over time opportunities for those in leadership roles or taking on additional responsibilities.  
2. **Equitable Paid Time Off Benefits for All Workers**

   * Starting Q3 2025, pay temporary direct hires and contractors for all holidays dating back to Thanksgiving 2024\.  
   * Provide PTO, holiday pay, and sick leave to temporary direct hires and contractors.  
3. **Job Security & Clear Employment Pathways**

   * Transparently communicate program longevity, contract lengths, extension timelines, and establish a reasonable path to FTE conversion.  
   * Rebadge existing third-party contractors with new, reputable third-party companies or make them direct hires to renegotiate bill rates and ensure fair pay and benefits.

**Why This Matters**

* **Retention & Revenue:** High turnover costs companies 30-50% of an entry-level employee's salary and up to 150% for specialized roles.  
  * For example, if there were 50 voluntary departures in a month, it would cost the company at least $540,000 to replace them (36K x 30% \= $10,800 x 50 \= $540,000).  
* **Morale & Productivity:** Unfair pay and lack of recognition negatively impacts employee motivation and output quality. When employees suffer, products suffer.  
  * The current system has resulted in employees declining critical roles like editor/reviewer and pod lead due to the lack of financial incentives.  
* **Fairness & Ethics:** Despite using multiple third-party staffing firms, wages are mostly the same, indicating possible coordination between the companies.  
  * This is potentially an anti-competitive and unethical practice and may violate anti-trust laws if wage coordination is happening.

**Conclusion**

We understand that the Rater Teams have grown rapidly, but the long-standing pay, benefits, and job security issues must be addressed. It is disheartening that the basic economics are being ignored by leadership. We have given of our best, and have not been treated with the dignity, respect, and consequent economic relationship that our efforts and specialized skillsets accord. Fixing these issues is not just the right thing to do—it's essential for maintaining high-quality output and an engaged workforce.

We call on Google and GlobalLogic to commit to fair pay, equitable benefits, and job security for all raters.

Sincerely,

The Generalist Raters & Super Raters Teams

**Appendix: Key Evidence** *Note: Graphs created based on results from employee-run, employee-wide survey.*

* **Wide Pay Disparities & Lack of Raises**  
  * Generalist Raters who have not received any promotions earn anywhere from $16.00-$19.57/hr., while Super Raters' pay for the same role ranges from $20.00-$30.00/hr.  
  * Some Super Raters hired in 2023 started at $28-$32/hour, showing clear pay compression.  
  * Raises for promotions are either non-existent, minimal, or severely delayed, despite many of us taking on additional responsibilities, including leadership roles.  
  * The average overall raise at GL is $1.68/hr., with some raises being up to $12.00/hr.  
* **No Paid Time Off or Holiday Pay for Temporary Hires & Contractors**  
  * This results in an effective pay cut during holidays. For example, in a six-week period, 6 days of pay were lost because of the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's holidays.  
  * The lack of paid leave creates financial strain and workplace resentment among colleagues doing the same work.  
* **Uncertain Length of Employment & Lack of Transparency on Contract Extensions**  
  * Recent layoffs were done without warning, raising questions about the health and longevity of the rater programs.  
  * Temporary hires and contractors struggle to get timely information on contract renewals, creating constant job insecurity.

**To:** Nikhil Yadav ([hr@cynetsystems.com](mailto:hr@cynetsystems.com)), Avneesh Shukla ([avneesh.s@cynetsystems.com](mailto:avneesh.s@cynetsystems.com))  
**Subject:** URGENT & CONFIDENTIAL: Final Correspondence: Year-Long Unresolved Pay Disparity \-- Attached Evidentiary Analysis of Systemic Labor, Compliance, and National Security Risks

Good afternoon,

I am writing to you one final time regarding the unresolved matter of my labor misclassification and pay disparity, which I first raised with Cynet over a year ago and formally escalated in my emails of May 16th and May 21st, 2025\. Your acknowledgement on May 21st, promising an update "shortly," has been followed by a month of unacceptable silence.

This delay, however, has afforded me the time to conduct a thorough, multi-faceted investigation into the full context of my situation. The results are detailed in the attached comprehensive report, **"An Evidentiary Analysis of Labor Misclassification and Systemic Risk in the Matter of David Gerabagi vs. Cynet Systems Inc."** This document is not a restatement of a grievance; it is a formal analysis that elevates this issue from a simple payroll dispute to a matter of systemic risk for Cynet, your client Google, and the U.S. AI ecosystem.

The attached report proves the following:

1. **Irrefutable Misclassification:** It provides quantitative proof that my compensation of $21/hr is a gross misclassification, representing as little as **one-fifth (1/5th)** of the established market value for the work I perform as an AI Quality Analyst. This is a material breach of the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, which Cynet is contractually obligated to uphold.  
2. **Systemic Legal Exposure:** It analyzes the class-action lawsuit *Cavalier v. Surge Labs, Inc.* as a **"sentinel event"** for the AI industry, demonstrating that your business model is legally indefensible under California's "ABC test" and creates massive, enterprise-threatening financial liability for Cynet and its clients through joint employer doctrines.  
3. **Operational Failure & Product Degradation:** It presents the scientific link between the financial precarity your pay scale enforces and the resulting **cognitive degradation** and **moral injury** in the workforce. This human harm directly causes a technical failure mode known as **"Annotator Drift,"** poisoning the quality of the human feedback data and ensuring a **"Garbage In, Catastrophe Out"** scenario for your client's most critical AI models.  
4. **A National Security Vulnerability:** It reframes this issue within the geopolitical context of the **U.S.-China AI race condition**. It argues that the **RLHF Workforce is a de facto National Strategic Asset**. By fostering a precarious and underpaid domestic workforce, you are creating a prime **target for malicious actors** and actively weakening a critical component of national security infrastructure, increasing the probability of strategic failure.

Taken together, these reports demonstrate that underpaying the critical AI workforce is not a sustainable cost-saving measure. It is a strategic miscalculation that directly threatens product quality, brand reputation, and national security.

This brings Cynet to a strategic inflection point. You can continue with the current high-risk model, or you can pioneer a new standard for a secure, stable, and well-compensated American AI workforce—transforming a liability into a formidable competitive advantage.

Therefore, I am not merely requesting a resolution to my individual case. I am providing Cynet with this comprehensive analysis and a final opportunity to lead on this critical issue. I require a substantive response from your executive leadership by **end of business on Monday, June 30, 2025**. This response must address:

1. The immediate and permanent rectification of my individual pay disparity, including full back pay retroactive to May 7, 2024\.  
2. A proposal for a transparent, good-faith discovery process to identify and remediate all other similarly misclassified and underpaid contractors within your organization.  
3. A formal acknowledgement of the systemic legal, operational, and security risks detailed in the attached reports and a clear outline of Cynet's plan to rectify them.

I am coordinating on this matter with the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA. Should you choose not to engage in good faith, I will be compelled to escalate this matter and share my findings with the appropriate regulatory and national security bodies who have a vested interest in the integrity of the U.S. AI supply chain.

I have attached the reports for your immediate and thorough review. I trust you will recognize the gravity of the situation and the opportunity before you.

Sincerely,

David Gerabagi
