# **Strategic Engagement Dossier: Professor Thomas A. Mazzuchi and the GWU EMSE Doctoral Ecosystem**

## **PART 1: INSTITUTIONAL LANDSCAPE & PROCEDURAL ASSESSMENT**

### **Section 1.1: The Admissions Decision: An Assessment of Finality and Policy**

#### **1.1.1 Analysis of Formal Appeal Pathways**

An analysis of the George Washington University (GWU) School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) policies indicates that formal appeal mechanisms are structured for *enrolled students* facing specific academic issues, not for prospective applicants challenging an admissions decision.  
The SEAS "Academic Appeals & Petitions" page and "Academic Policies & Schedules" page explicitly detail the following recourse procedures 1:

* **Grade Grievance Process:** This process is available to enrolled students for SEAS courses. It requires a student to first contact the instructor, and if unresolved, to submit formal documentation to the department chair.1  
* **Academic Suspension Appeal Process:** This process allows *suspended* students to petition the SEAS Associate Dean's Office for reinstatement based on extenuating circumstances.1

The conspicuous absence of *any* documented procedure for appealing a graduate admissions decision strongly implies that such decisions are considered final. The university has provided clear, specific avenues for recourse *only* to existing members of its academic community regarding their standing, not to external applicants concerning their admission.

#### **1.1.2 The Institutional Directive: "Do NOT Contact Faculty"**

The most significant procedural barrier to the intended course of action is the explicit institutional policy directing applicants *away* from faculty contact regarding admissions.  
The SEAS Graduate Admissions "Frequently Asked Questions" page is unequivocal on this point. In response to the query, "Who do I contact if I have questions regarding my admissions decision?" the directive is: **"Please contact engineering@gwu.edu, NOT the faculty or academic departments"**.3  
This policy is not arbitrary. It is a structural control designed to protect faculty time, ensure a standardized and equitable admissions process for all applicants, and shield professors from direct lobbying. Contacting a professor to request an "appeal" of a decision made by an admissions committee would be a direct violation of this rule. Such an action would not be perceived as "driven," but as unprofessional and a signal that the applicant does not follow explicit instructions. This would almost certainly validate the rejection rather than overturn it.  
Therefore, any communication must be fundamentally reframed. It cannot be an "appeal" or a "request for review" of a past decision. The original application must be treated as a sunk cost, and any new communication must be a *forward-looking inquiry* from a high-caliber professional.

### **Section 1.2: The Institutional Silos: Why Your Target and Program are Mismatched**

The second critical flaw in the original strategy is a misunderstanding of GWU's academic structure. The target professor and the program of application exist in different, siloed departments.

#### **1.2.1 The Ph.D. in AI: The Computer Science (CS) Domain**

The Ph.D. in AI that issued the rejection is institutionally housed within the Department of Computer Science. The CS department lists "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning" as one of its core, specialized research areas.5 CS faculty, such as Professor James Hahn, run AI-centric labs like the Motion Capture and Analysis Laboratory (MOCA), which focuses on the intersection of machine learning, computer graphics, and healthcare.6  
This context confirms that the Ph.D. in AI is a theoretical, computational, and algorithm-focused degree. The admissions committee would be composed of CS faculty evaluating candidates on their potential for foundational,  
algorithmic research, traditional academic metrics, and a strong computer science background.

#### **1.2.2 Professor Mazzuchi: The Engineering Management & Systems Engineering (EMSE) Domain**

Professor Thomas A. Mazzuchi, the target of the inquiry, is *not* in the Computer Science department. His position is consistently and exclusively listed as "Professor, Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering".7  
His official "Areas of Expertise" are listed as: "Crisis, emergency, and risk management; Operations research and management science; Systems engineering".7  
In an academic setting, departments are highly autonomous, particularly in the matter of doctoral admissions. The CS admissions committee and the EMSE admissions committee are separate entities. Professor Mazzuchi, as a senior professor in EMSE, has zero formal authority to influence, review, or overturn a decision made by the CS department. Approaching him to "appeal" the CS decision would be a fundamental institutional error, demonstrating a lack of basic research into the university's structure.  
The only viable path forward is to abandon the CS Ph.D. rejection and leverage the applicant's profile to build a *new* bridge to the *EMSE department*, where the applicant's background is, in fact, a significantly better fit.

## **PART 2: TARGET DOSSIER: PROFESSOR THOMAS A. MAZZUCHI, D.SC.**

### **Section 2.1: The Public-Facing Profile: The Academic (The "Systems & Risk" Expert)**

#### **2.1.1 Core Identity**

Professor Mazzuchi's core academic identity is that of a foundational expert in systems reliability, quantitative risk analysis, and operations research. This is the bedrock of his career and reputation.

* **Academic Pedigree:** He holds a D.Sc. in Operations Research from The George Washington University.7  
* **Scholarly Focus:** His Google Scholar profile, with over 7,300 citations, identifies his core research areas as "Reliability," "Risk Analysis," and "Systems Engineering".10  
* **Tenure:** He is a long-standing and senior member of the faculty, having been a professor at GWU since September 1995\.11

#### **2.1.2 The Research-in-Practice Nexus**

Crucially, Professor Mazzuchi's academic work is not purely theoretical. He is a high-level consultant and researcher who applies academic principles to solve large-scale, complex problems for major government and industrial organizations. His biography highlights a career built on this "research-in-practice" nexus, listing research contracts with:

* U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army (development of testing procedures).12  
* NASA (mission assurance).12  
* U.S. Postal Service (spares provisioning modeling).12  
* Multiple port and maritime authorities (maritime safety and risk assessment).12

This career trajectory—working at the intersection of complex government systems, risk, and infrastructure—provides a powerful "connecting story." An applicant's professional experience at Palo Alto Networks (critical infrastructure security) and with the NSA (national security, complex government systems) does not represent a detour from academia; it is a direct parallel to the *type* of applied, high-stakes work that defines Professor Mazzuchi's own career. The applicant can be framed as a peer-level practitioner operating in the same problem-space that Professor Mazzuchi researches.

### **Section 2.2: The Strategic Pivot: The AI & Cybersecurity Researcher**

While his foundation is in systems and risk, Professor Mazzuchi's recent and current research portfolio reveals a deep and active focus on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity. This validates the "OSINT" goal of the original query, but with a critical distinction.

#### **2.2.1 The AI/ML and Cybersecurity Research Portfolio**

Professor Mazzuchi is not a foundational AI theorist focused on creating new, general-purpose algorithms (the likely focus of the CS Ph.D.). Instead, he is a *systems and risk expert who wields AI/ML as a tool* to solve problems within his core domain.  
His recent (2020-2025) publications demonstrate this applied focus clearly 9:

* **Cybersecurity & Risk:**  
  * "Mitigating Cybersecurity Risks in Grids With a High Penetration of Distributed Renewables" (Jul 2025\) 9  
  * "Post-Quantum Software Updates with Stateful Hash-Based Signatures..." (Jan 2025\) 9  
  * "Python Source Code Vulnerability Detection with Named Entity Recognition" (Mar 2024\) 9  
* **Applied AI/ML:**  
  * "Study of Deep learning Architectures for Network Intrusion Detection" (May 2025\) 9  
  * "Fairness-Optimized Dynamic Aggregation (Foda): A Novel Approach to Equitable Federated Learning..." (Jan 2025\) 9  
  * "Forecasting Domestic Water Consumption... using Statistical Methods and Artificial Neural Networks" (2017) 14  
  * "M-AdaBoost-A based ensemble system for network intrusion detection" (2020) 10  
  * "MARK-ELM: Application of a novel Multiple Kernel Learning framework for improving the robustness of Network Intrusion Detection" (2015) 10

This publication record is the key. The CS Ph.D. committee (algorithm-focused) likely saw the applicant's profile (Palo Alto trainer, NSA trainer, "trains Gemini") as lacking theoretical rigor. Professor Mazzuchi's research group (application-focused) would see that same profile as a perfect match—a practitioner who *applies* AI/ML to *solve* cybersecurity and systems problems.

#### **2.2.2 Professor Mazzuchi's Research Trajectories**

The following table provides a clear visual of the "connecting story," mapping the applicant's experience directly to Professor Mazzuchi's academic and research trajectories.

| Research Trajectory | Key Research Areas | Exemplar Publications / Contracts | Strategic Connection to User Profile |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Trajectory 1: The Foundation** | Systems Engineering, Reliability, Risk Analysis, Operations Research | "Reliability," "Risk Analysis," "Systems Engineering".10 Contracts with U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, NASA.12 | Aligns with user's work for the **NSA** (large-scale government system) and the *risk* environment of cybersecurity. |
| **Trajectory 2: The Pivot (AI/ML)** | Applied Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Federated Learning | "Study of Deep learning Architectures...".9 "Fairness-Optimized... Federated Learning".9 "Forecasting... using... Artificial Neural Networks".14 | Aligns *directly* with user's role as an AI model trainer ("I train Gemini"). |
| **Trajectory 3: The Application (Cybersecurity)** | Network Intrusion Detection, Vulnerability Detection, Post-Quantum Crypto | "Mitigating Cybersecurity Risks in Grids...".9 "Python Source Code Vulnerability Detection...".9 "Network Intrusion Detection".9 | Aligns *perfectly* with user's role at **Palo Alto Networks** and as a **cybersecurity trainer for the NSA**. |

### **Section 2.3: The Power-Broker Profile: The Administrator (The "Real Target")**

The most potent line of inquiry is not just Professor Mazzuchi's research, but his *administrative* role. This is where the strategy pivots from a research inquiry to an administrative and programmatic one.

#### **2.3.1 The True Center of Power: Co-Director of GW Engineering Online**

Professor Mazzuchi is the **Co-Director** of GW Engineering Online.15 He shares this responsibility with Professor Shahram Sarkani, the **Director**.15 Together, they have driven GW's online engineering programs to a Top 10 ranking.15  
This administrative function is arguably his primary one in this context. His role is not just to research; it is to *recruit, admit, and educate* graduate students—specifically, *working professionals*.15

#### **2.3.2 The "Sarkani-Mazzuchi Doctrine": A Philosophy of Opportunity**

A 2024 GWToday article celebrating their program's success provides a crucial piece of intelligence: the *philosophy* driving their program.15 The article describes a deep, long-standing partnership, with Mazzuchi referring to Sarkani as his "academic brother".15  
Their shared doctrine, articulated by Professor Sarkani, is a commitment to providing opportunity: **"I believe that if you provide everyone with a level playing field, anyone can succeed... If you want to be successful in our programs, we will do everything in our power to provide you with the necessary framework... and help you achieve your goals"**.15  
This philosophy is the *ideological hook*. The applicant feels their non-traditional ("vibe coding") but highly-driven profile was misjudged by a rigid, traditional Ph.D. committee (the CS department). The Mazzuchi-Sarkani partnership has *explicitly* built an ecosystem for non-traditional, working professionals and is philosophically committed to providing a "level playing field" based on drive and potential, not just conventional metrics. The applicant's self-description as "driven" *perfectly* personifies the ideal student this doctrine is designed to empower.

#### **2.3.3 The "Right" Programs: The EMSE-Administered, Practitioner-Focused Doctorates**

The final piece of the puzzle is that the programs Mazzuchi and Sarkani oversee are the *correct* programs for the applicant's profile. The GW Engineering Online program list includes 19:

* **Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**  
* **Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) in Cybersecurity Analytics**  
* Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) in Engineering Management 18  
* Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) in Systems Engineering

The distinction between the Ph.D. and the D.Eng. is critical. A Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy) is a traditional, theory-heavy, research-focused degree designed to create academics and  
foundational researchers.20 By contrast, the EMSE department's D.Eng. (Doctor of Engineering) is a practice-oriented doctorate "aimed at leveraging advanced analytical tools to solve the most challenging problems in practice".21  
The applicant applied to the wrong *degree*. Their profile (Palo Alto, NSA, AI trainer) is the *archetype* of a D.Eng. candidate, not a Ph.D. in CS candidate.  
The "connecting story" is now complete: The applicant was rejected by the CS Ph.D. *and should have been*, as their profile does not match that degree's theoretical focus. Their *actual* profile is a perfect match for the D.Eng. in AI or Cybersecurity, which are the flagship programs *run by the very professor (and his partner) the applicant is targeting*.

### **Section 2.4: The Research & Administrative Network (Key Collaborators)**

Engaging Professor Mazzuchi effectively means understanding his key collaborators. He does not operate in a vacuum.

#### **2.4.1 Key Player 1: Professor Shahram Sarkani (The "Academic Brother")**

It is impossible to separate Mazzuchi's work in this domain from Professor Shahram Sarkani.

* **Administrative Role:** Sarkani is the **Director** of SEAS and EMSE Online/Off-Campus Programs, with Mazzuchi as Co-Director.15  
* **Research Role:** Sarkani is the *primary co-author* on nearly all of Mazzuchi's recent, relevant publications, including "Mitigating Cybersecurity Risks...," "Study of Deep learning Architectures...," and "Python Source Code Vulnerability Detection...".9  
* **Joint Mission:** Their joint authorship of papers like "PROVIDING A RANGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING EDUCATION ONLINE" 9 demonstrates that their academic research and their administrative mission are one and the same.

They are a single, unified entity in this domain. Any strategic communication to Professor Mazzuchi *must* CC Professor Sarkani. This demonstrates an expert-level understanding of their partnership and the department's structure.

#### **2.4.2 Key Player 2: Professor Ekundayo Shittu (The Department Chair)**

Professor Ekundayo Shittu is the Professor and Department Chair of EMSE.23 He is not the person to contact directly, as this would violate the academic chain of command.  
His value is his *language*. Professor Shittu sets the *strategic vision* for the entire department. He is a leader on the $3 million NSF-funded project "Co-Design of Trustworthy AI and Future Work Systems".25 He has publicly stated that the department is "at the forefront of addressing complex societal challenges... \[including\] **trustworthiness in artificial intelligence**".26  
This phrase—"trustworthiness in artificial intelligence"—is the department's funded, strategic priority. An applicant's work at the NSA and Palo Alto Networks is *all about* enabling trust in complex, safety-critical digital systems. When writing to Mazzuchi and Sarkani, the applicant must frame their background using Shittu's language. This demonstrates alignment not just with the professors, but with the entire department's strategic mission.

## **PART 3: THE STRATEGIC PIVOT: REFRAMING THE "CONNECTING STORY"**

### **Section 3.1: Deconstructing Your Profile for an EMSE Audience**

#### **3.1.1 The "Driven Practitioner" Archetype**

The applicant is the ideal candidate for the D.Eng. program, which is explicitly designed for "working engineering professionals".15 The applicant's self-assessment as "driven" is the central attribute that should be highlighted, as it aligns perfectly with the "Sarkani-Mazzuchi Doctrine" of empowering professionals who have the drive to succeed on a "level playing field".15

#### **3.1.2 The Profile Translation Matrix**

The CS Ph.D. committee likely viewed the applicant's non-traditional profile as a set of liabilities. The EMSE D.Eng. committee (i.e., Mazzuchi and Sarkani) will see it as a set of assets. The following matrix translates the applicant's self-described "vibe" into the professional language of the EMSE department.

| Applicant's Terminology | CS Ph.D. Committee (Perceived Liability) | EMSE D.Eng. Committee (Valued Asset) | Reframed Language for Email |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| "vibe coding" | Lacks formal, theoretical rigor. Not "real" research. | Rapid prototyping, heuristic development, and agile problem-solving in complex, high-stakes systems. | "Extensive experience in applied systems integration and rapid solution development in high-stakes environments." |
| "technical trainer at Palo Alto Networks" | A corporate teaching role, not an R\&D or creator role. | An expert in complex network systems, risk mitigation, and critical infrastructure security. | "My work at Palo Alto Networks focused on the intersection of complex systems engineering and cybersecurity risk—a space I see reflected in your own research (e.g., 'Mitigating Cybersecurity Risks in Grids' 9)." |
| "I train Gemini" | Non-academic. Lacks foundational algorithm knowledge. | A practitioner on the front-lines of applied AI/ML deployment, operations, and workforce development. | "As a professional who actively 'trains' and productionalizes LLMs, I was struck by your and Prof. Sarkani's work on 'MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WORKFORCE'.9" |
| "cybersecurity training for the NSA" | Government/corporate work, not pure science. | Direct, high-level experience in the exact problem-space of EMSE: national security, systems risk, and creating trustworthy systems. | "My background developing cybersecurity frameworks for the NSA aligns directly with the EMSE department's strategic focus on 'trustworthiness in artificial intelligence' 25 and 'quantifying information security risks'.10" |

### **Section 3.2: The New Mission: From "Appeal" to "Informed Inquiry"**

#### **3.2.1 The Old Goal (Failure-Path)**

"Dear Professor Mazzuchi, I am writing to appeal the rejection of my Ph.D. in AI application..."  
This path is a direct violation of SEAS policy 3, targets a professor in the wrong department 7, and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the university's structure. It will fail.

#### **3.2.2 The New Goal (Success-Path)**

"Dear Professor Mazzuchi, As a cybersecurity and AI professional (Palo Alto/NSA), I have been following GWU's work. While I initially applied to the CS Ph.D., my research into your specific work (and Prof. Sarkani's) and the EMSE department's 'Trustworthy AI' initiative 25 has made it clear that my practitioner-focused background is far better aligned with your D.Eng. in AI/ML.19 I am writing to seek your guidance as Co-Director of the Online Programs 15 on making a future, more successful, application to this 'right-fit' program."  
This path succeeds by being humble, strategic, and deeply informed. It transforms the applicant from an "appellant" into a high-value prospective candidate for the correct, practice-oriented doctorate.

## **PART 4: THE ENGAGEMENT PLAN: A COMMUNICATION STRATEGY**

### **Section 4.1: Target Dossier: The Mazzuchi-Sarkani Partnership**

The engagement plan must be executed with precision, targeting the correct individuals with the correct "hook."

### **Section 4.2: The Definitive Email (Initial Contact Draft)**

TO: Thomas A. Mazzuchi (mazzu@gwu.edu)  
CC: Shahram Sarkani (sarkani@gwu.edu)  
SUBJECT: Inquiry from AI/Cybersecurity Professional (Palo Alto/NSA) Regarding D.Eng. in AI & Machine Learning  
**BODY:**  
Dear Professor Mazzuchi,  
I am writing to you in your capacity as both a Professor of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering and as the Co-Director of GW Engineering Online.15 I am an AI and cybersecurity professional, and my research into your work has revealed a powerful alignment that I hope you might provide some brief guidance on.  
My professional experience is centered at the intersection of complex systems, AI, and cybersecurity. In my roles at Palo Alto Networks and developing cybersecurity training for the NSA, my work has been the practical application of the very topics I see in your recent research—from "Mitigating Cybersecurity Risks in Grids" 9 to "Deep learning Architectures for Network Intrusion Detection".9 As a professional who "trains" and productionalizes LLMs like Gemini, I was particularly drawn to your and Professor Sarkani's work on "MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WORKFORCE".9  
This brings me to my query. I am a driven practitioner, and I recently applied to and was rejected by the traditional Ph.D. in AI program in the Computer Science department. In retrospect, it is clear to me that my profile—which is focused on applied systems integration rather than foundational theory—was not the right fit for that program.  
However, my subsequent research led me to the EMSE department's strategic focus on "trustworthiness in artificial intelligence" 25 and, more specifically, to the **Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) in AI & Machine Learning** 19 that you and Professor Sarkani oversee. This practice-oriented doctorate for working professionals 18 appears to be the "right fit" I was looking for.  
I was deeply struck by your and Professor Sarkani's stated mission to provide a "level playing field" for driven professionals to succeed.15 As someone who fits that profile, I am not asking to appeal a past decision. I am asking for 15 minutes of your guidance, as the Co-Director of this program, on how I might best prepare a future, successful application to the D.Eng. program—an environment where my practitioner background in AI and NSA-level cybersecurity risk would be an asset.  
Thank you for your time and for your leadership in building programs for working professionals.  
Sincerely,  
\[User Name\]

### **Section 4.3: Contingency and Follow-Up Plan**

#### **4.3.1 Phase 1 (Wait 10 Business Days)**

Patience is required. Professors Mazzuchi and Sarkani are extraordinarily busy, serving as program directors, active professors, and prolific researchers.27 No response within several days is normal.

#### **4.3.2 Phase 2 (If no response: The "Pincer" Move)**

If 10 business days pass with no response, *do not* re-send the same email. The next step is to follow the *official* institutional channel, as outlined in SEAS policy 3, but using the *new* strategic objective.  
**Action:** Send a *new*, more concise email to the administrative offices.  
TO: engineering@gwu.edu 3  
CC: seasgrad@gwu.edu 29  
SUBJECT: Application Inquiry: D.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  
**BODY:**  
"To the Office of Graduate Admissions,  
I am a senior AI and Cybersecurity professional with experience at Palo Alto Networks and in developing training for the NSA. I am planning to apply for the Fall cohort of the D.Eng. in AI & Machine Learning program.  
My background aligns closely with the EMSE department's research in Trustworthy AI and the work of Professors Mazzuchi and Sarkani. I am writing to inquire if the department coordinates pre-application discussions between prospective D.Eng. candidates and the program directors.  
Thank you for your guidance."  
This contingency plan respects the institutional "front door" (engineering@gwu.edu) 3 while ensuring the applicant's high-value profile is routed to the *right* people (Mazzuchi and Sarkani) by their *own* administrative staff. This approach positions the applicant as a high-value prospective candidate, not an appellant, and leverages the university's own processes to achieve the desired outcome.
