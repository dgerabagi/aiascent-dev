A minimal mid-shot of a professional at a white standing desk in a quiet room; a small precise circular control with three cyan nodes sits in front of their fingertip; a subtle dotted bead-trail runs horizontally linking the four labels "CURATION" · "PARALLEL PROMPTING" · "VALIDATION" · "INTEGRATION", with the finger hovering over the central control; lighting is moody and photographic, shallow depth isolates the gesture; no extra graphics besides these words and the tiny circle; premium realism, no neon, no 3D sci-fi chrome—just elegant restraint.
