A hyper-realistic daylight boardroom with matte concrete and a wide view of the city; a senior leader gestures to a refined circular workflow overlay hovering in front of them, divided into four equal segments labeled "CURATION", "PARALLEL PROMPTING", "VALIDATION", "INTEGRATION"; the ring uses thin concentric strokes and subtle radial ticks, cyan accents on a graphite palette; soft window light wraps the subject, subtle rim separates them from the background; 35 mm lens, shoulder-level angle; add the title "THE VIRTUOSO’S LOOP" centered above and a small lower-left tag "MODULE 1: THE VIRTUOSO’S LOOP — LESSON 1.1: THE PROFESSIONAL’S PLAYBOOK"; realistic glass reflections, restrained glow, absolutely no clutter or extra UI panels.
