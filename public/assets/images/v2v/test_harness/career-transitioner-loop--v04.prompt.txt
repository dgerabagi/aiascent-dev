In a glass-walled meeting room, a professional points to a projected circular diagram on the glass—thin strokes, consistent vector weights, labeled exactly "CURATION", "PARALLEL PROMPTING", "VALIDATION", "INTEGRATION"; small arrows imply clockwise flow without thick swooshes; desaturated neutral palette with a hint of cyan; 50 mm lens, clean reflections, natural daylight; no extra icons or text, no garish glow—this reads like a real photo of a real diagram.
