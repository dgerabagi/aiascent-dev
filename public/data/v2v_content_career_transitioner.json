By prompting it to explain its reasoning, or by analyzing the code it produces, you are observing an expert's thought process.

Relying on it to guess is a recipe for disaster, leading to it referencing outdated information or applying the wrong logic. Proper annotation removes this ambiguity.

A file in `/Proposals/Active/` has a clear context that a file sitting on your desktop does not. 3. **Apply Tags:** When possible, use systems that allow for explicit tagging.

When collaborating with an AI, this requires a shift in communication style—from casual conversation to **Structured Interaction**. This is the practice of formalizing your requests into clear, unambiguous commands, much like writing a technical specification or a project brief. Instead of a vague, conversational prompt, you provide the AI with a structured set of instructions that define its role, the context, the required steps, and the expected output format. This discipline is the key to transforming the AI from a creative but sometimes unreliable brainstorming partner into a dependable execution engine for your strategic vision.",
