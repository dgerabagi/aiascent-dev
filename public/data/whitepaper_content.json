This whitepaper introduces the Data Curation Environment (DCE), a framework and toolset integrated into Visual Studio Code that transforms the content creation process itself into a valuable organizational asset. By capturing the entire workflow as a persistent, auditable knowledge graph, the DCE provides the infrastructure necessary to scale expertise, ensure quality, and accelerate the entire organizational mission.",
