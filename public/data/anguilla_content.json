Through a stroke of digital luck, we own the most valuable real estate on the future internet: the **.ai** top-level domain. \n\nIn 2023 alone, this asset generated approximately **US$32 million (EC$87 million)**—nearly 20% of the government's total revenue. \n\nCurrently, this is 'rent'. We are the landlords, but we don't own the building. The vision is to transform Anguilla from the *symbolic* home of AI into the *literal* home of the AI economy. We propose a comprehensive national strategy to become the world's first **AI-Native Nation**: a society where every citizen is empowered by artificial intelligence, where government services are frictionless, and where the economy is driven by high-value cognitive labor.",
