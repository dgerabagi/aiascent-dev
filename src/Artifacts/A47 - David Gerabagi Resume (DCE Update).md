### Projects

#### **Data Curation Environment (DCE) & aiascent.dev** (Lead Architect & Developer) | Mar 2025 - Present
*Project Link: [https://aiascent.dev/](https://aiascent.dev/)*

**Project Description:**
Conceived and architected the Data Curation Environment (DCE), a VS Code extension that revolutionizes the human-AI development workflow. The DCE transforms AI collaboration from an ad-hoc, conversational process into a structured, auditable, and highly efficient engineering discipline. The project includes the `aiascent.dev` website, which serves as both a promotional platform and a living demonstration of the DCE's capabilities, as it was built entirely using the tool itself.

**Project Highlights:**
*   **Architectural Vision & Metainterpretability:** Designed and built a novel "Process as Asset" framework where the entire development workflow—context curation, AI prompts, parallel responses, and developer decisions—is captured as a persistent, navigable knowledge graph. This provides unprecedented auditability and enables a meta-interpretability loop where the AI is given its own parsing logic as context.
*   **Full-Stack Tool Development:** Engineered a comprehensive VS Code extension using TypeScript, React, and Webview technology, featuring multiple custom panels for context curation and parallel AI response management.
*   **Advanced AI Integration & RAG:** Deployed and managed local LLMs (vLLM) and developed a multi-tenant Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with dual knowledge bases (FAISS vector indexes), allowing the integrated AI assistant, @Ascentia, to provide context-specific expertise on different topics.
*   **DevOps & CI/CD:** Designed and managed a complete, self-hosted deployment pipeline for `aiascent.dev`, including DNS, a Caddy reverse proxy for secure HTTPS, and process management, mirroring production DevOps workflows.
*   **Human-AI Workflow Innovation:** Created the "Parallel Co-Pilot Panel," an integrated UI for managing, comparing, diffing, and safely testing multiple, simultaneous AI-generated code solutions, dramatically accelerating the iterative development cycle.

#### **Catalyst AI – A Cloud-Based GAIaaS Solution for Slack Workspaces** | May 2023
**Project Highlights:**
*   **Pioneering "Vibe Coding":** Developed a hybrid/multi-cloud AI-as-a-Service platform, Catalyst AI, through an intuitive, iterative process now known as "vibe coding." The platform includes a fully-automated Slack bot and website with end-to-end deployment.
*   **Collaborative AI in Slack:** Engineered a "multiplayer GPT" by integrating Generative AI into Slack with Python, enabling users to learn by observing colleagues' AI interactions and boosting adoption of AI tools.
*   **Early RAG Implementation:** Employed a Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for semantic searches against user-uploaded PDF content, delivering capabilities that surpassed standard ChatGPT 13 months before the term "RAG" was widely adopted.
*   **SaaS Architecture & Security:** Re-architected the project into a scalable, near-zero marginal cost SaaS model and implemented defense-in-depth security protocols.
