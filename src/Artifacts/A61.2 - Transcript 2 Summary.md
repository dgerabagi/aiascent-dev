## 1. High-Level Summary

This transcript captures a practical, hands-on coaching session where the curator guides a learner through the initial setup and organization of their project repository for the V2V workflow. The conversation focuses on establishing a logical folder structure to manage different types of documentation (CUI, customer docs, frameworks, templates). The session emphasizes the core principle that a well-organized repository is the foundation for effective data curation and, consequently, for high-quality AI collaboration. The concept of a "master project template" is developed as a way to bootstrap future projects.

## 2. Key Learnings & Insights

*   **Folder Structure as a Form of Tagging:** The curator explains that folder names themselves act as "tags." A well-named folder (e.g., `UKI-templates`) provides inherent context to the AI, which can infer the purpose of the files within it without needing explicit instructions.
*   **Organization is Driven by Curation Efficiency:** The primary driver for how to organize files should be curation efficiency. The user will naturally start grouping related files into folders to minimize the number of checkboxes they need to click when selecting context for a prompt.
*   **The "External Brain" Concept:** The repository is framed as the user's "external brain." It's a persistent, organized collection of knowledge that grows over time and makes the user's interactions with AI progressively more powerful and personalized.
*   **Separating Tasks from Metadata:** A key architectural decision is made to create a top-level `tasks` folder. This separates the specific, iterative work of a project (like the "NC-DOC" project) from the more static, reusable metadata (like frameworks and templates), leading to a cleaner structure.
*   **Reverse-Engineering a Template:** The best way to create a project template is to first build out a real project. Once the project is complete, its structure and key files can be "reverse-engineered" into a clean, reusable skeleton for future projects.
*   **"It's All Just Text":** The curator reiterates the core philosophy that all forms of data (Excel sheets, PDFs, etc.) must be "flattened" into a text-based format (ideally Markdown) to be usable by the AI. This is analogized to the meme "Wait, it's all Ohio? Always has been," but replaced with "Wait, it's all just text? Always has been."

## 3. Best Bits (Direct Quotes)

*   **On the purpose of organization:**
    > "Because you've structured it intelligently, it's intelligent and it'll get it. So it's good. It's good. You don't even... And then you'll only need to explicitly explain that which it clearly didn't get."

*   **On the natural evolution of structure:**
    > "The only constraint you will find is you will realize it gets annoying to check the box to select and deselect. You will realize it's better if these five files go in a folder so that I can just click it. That's what's gonna happen... That's how you're gonna constrain your organization."

*   **On the value of the process:**
    > "Even if AI didn't exist, having this organized in this way would still help you be more... Oh yeah. You see what I'm saying? And that's what I typically do... And for the final and final. And I never wanted to do this organization in my life up until... the AI values it, right? You see what I'm saying? So it's now fun to be organized. It's valuable."
