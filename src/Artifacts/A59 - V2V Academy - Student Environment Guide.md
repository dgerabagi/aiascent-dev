## 1. Overview

Welcome to the V2V Academy! This guide outlines the software you'll need to participate in the practical exercises and explains the unique human-AI interaction model we will use throughout the course. Our goal is to create a learning environment that is both powerful and supportive, meeting you exactly where you are on your learning journey.

## 2. Your Development & Learning Environment

The entire V2V curriculum is built around a single, powerful tool: **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.

*   **Why VS Code?** VS Code is more than just a text editor; it is the environment where the **Data Curation Environment (DCE)** lives. The DCE is the core tool you will use to practice the Virtuoso's Workflow. By learning within the same environment used by professionals, you are gaining authentic, real-world experience from day one.
*   **Required Software:**
    1.  **Visual Studio Code:** The latest version.
    2.  **Node.js:** Required to run the Next.js/React projects for the exercises.
    3.  **Git:** Essential for the "Test-and-Revert" validation loop and for versioning your work.
    4.  **The DCE Extension:** You will be provided with the `.vsix` file for the Data Curation Environment.

Detailed, step-by-step installation instructions for all required software will be provided in the first lesson of the curriculum.

## 3. The AI as Your Cognitive Tutor

Throughout this course, you will be working in partnership with an AI assistant. This AI is more than a simple chatbot; it is designed to act as your **Cognitive Tutor**.

### 3.1. What is a Cognitive Tutor?

A cognitive tutor is an AI system designed to mimic a human expert, providing personalized, one-on-one instruction. It adapts to your specific needs, tracks your progress, and provides real-time feedback. The AI tutor's goal is not to give you the answers, but to guide you in discovering the answers for yourself.

### 3.2. How to Interact with Your AI Tutor

The most important principle of our learning model is: **the AI meets you where you are.** We do not assume you have any prior knowledge of a specific topic. Instead, we rely on you to make your knowledge gaps explicit.

*   **Announce Your Gaps:** The AI does not know what you don't know. It is your responsibility to announce any gaps in your understanding *as part of the context of your request*. This is a core skill of data curation.

*   **Example Interaction:**
    Imagine an exercise asks you to run a Node.js application for the first time. If you have never done this before, you would structure your interaction with the AI as follows:

    > **Your Prompt to the AI:** "My task is to run this Node.js application. **My knowledge gap is that I have never run a Node.js application before and I'm not sure what the command is or where to run it.** Please provide me with the step-by-step instructions to run the application in the VS Code terminal."

By explicitly stating your "knowledge gap," you provide the AI with the precise context it needs to act as an effective tutor. It will not assume you know the basics; it will start from the beginning and guide you through the process, just as a human mentor would. This method of interaction is, in itself, a form of deliberate practice for the data curation and context engineering skills you are here to learn.
