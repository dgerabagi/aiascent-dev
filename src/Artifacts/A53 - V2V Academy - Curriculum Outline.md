- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Proposes a multi-module curriculum structure for the V2V Academy, designed to guide learners from the fundamentals of "Vibecoding" to the mastery of the "Virtuoso's Workflow." Each lesson is tailored to three distinct learner personas.
- **Tags:** v2v, curriculum design, instructional design, learning pathway, cognitive apprenticeship, persona

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the proposed curriculum structure for the "Vibecoding to Virtuosity" (V2V) Academy. The curriculum is designed as a structured pathway that embodies the principles of Cognitive Apprenticeship. It follows a "backwards design," starting with the end goal—the expert "Virtuoso"—and progressively building the foundational skills required to reach that state.

The primary learning interface for all modules will be the `aiascent.dev` interactive report viewer, creating a consistent and immersive experience.

## 2. The Three-Persona Approach

To provide a more personalized and effective learning experience, each lesson in the V2V curriculum is presented in three distinct versions, tailored to our primary learner personas (defined in `A58`):

1.  **The Career Transitioner:** Content is framed around professional development, strategic advantage, and augmenting existing expertise.
2.  **The Underequipped Graduate:** Content is focused on gaining a competitive edge, building a strong portfolio, and acquiring in-demand, practical skills for the job market.
3.  **The Young Precocious:** Content uses more engaging, game-oriented language ("level up," "mastery") and focuses on channeling raw talent into disciplined, powerful creation.

## 3. The V2V Learning Pathway: A 4-Module Structure

The curriculum is divided into four core modules, each representing a stage in the developer's journey.
