## 1. Overview

This document outlines the proposed curriculum structure for the "Vibecoding to Virtuosity" (V2V) Academy. The curriculum is designed as a structured pathway that embodies the principles of Cognitive Apprenticeship. It follows a "backwards design," starting with the end goal—the expert "Virtuoso"—and progressively building the foundational skills required to reach that state.

The primary learning interface for all modules will be the `aiascent.dev` interactive report viewer, creating a consistent and immersive experience.

## 2. The V2V Learning Pathway: A 4-Module Structure

The curriculum is divided into four core modules, each representing a stage in the developer's journey.

### **Module 1: The Virtuoso's Loop - Charting the Destination**

*   **Objective:** To introduce the learner to the complete, end-to-end expert workflow as the "north star" for their journey. This corresponds to the **Modeling** phase of Cognitive Apprenticeship, where the expert's process is made visible.
*   **Lessons:**
    *   **1.1: The Virtuoso's Workflow:** A detailed walkthrough of the entire cycle, from Curation to Parallel Prompting, Validation, and Finalization (based on `A51`).
    *   **1.2: The Philosophy of V2V:** An introduction to the core principles and mental models (based on `A50`).
    *   **1.3: The Citizen Architect:** A vision-setting lesson on the ultimate goal of the pathway.
*   **Capstone Project:** Learners will be given a complete, pre-packaged project and will follow a guided tutorial to execute a single, full cycle of the Virtuoso's Loop.

### **Module 2: The Curator's Toolkit - Mastering the Foundations**

*   **Objective:** To build the foundational, data-centric skills identified in `A52`. This module focuses on teaching learners how to think like data architects and critical analysts.
*   **Lessons:**
    *   **2.1: Introduction to Data Curation:** Principles of gathering, organizing, and structuring information for AI context.
    *   **2.2: The Art of Annotation:** How to label data, write descriptive names, and create metadata that makes context machine-readable.
    *   **2.3: Critical Analysis of AI Output:** Techniques for spotting hallucinations, logical fallacies, and misalignments in AI-generated text and code.
*   **Capstone Project:** Learners will be given a large, disorganized collection of documents and tasked with curating and annotating them into a high-quality, structured knowledge base for a specific project.

### **Module 3: The Apprentice's Forge - Structured Interaction**

*   **Objective:** To transition the learner from passive analysis to active, structured collaboration with the AI. This corresponds to the **Coaching and Scaffolding** phases of Cognitive Apprenticeship.
*   **Lessons:**
    *   **3.1: From Conversation to Command:** The principles of structured prompting and interaction schemas.
    *   **3.2: The Feedback Loop in Practice:** A hands-on lab where learners use system-generated errors as "expert feedback" to guide the AI in fixing buggy code.
    *   **3.3: Introduction to the Test-and-Revert Workflow:** A practical guide to using Git for safe, rapid testing of AI suggestions.
*   **Capstone Project:** Learners will be given a small, buggy codebase and a failing test suite. They must use the feedback loop and the test-and-revert workflow to guide an AI to fix all the bugs and make the tests pass.

### **Module 4: The Vibecoder's Canvas - Intuitive Exploration**

*   **Objective:** To empower the learner to apply their skills to their own ideas, entering the **Exploration** phase of Cognitive Apprenticeship.
*   **Lessons:**
    *   **4.1: Defining Your Vision:** How to translate a high-level idea into a clear "Project Scope" artifact.
    *   **4.2: The Blank Page Problem:** Strategies for using the AI to brainstorm and generate initial planning artifacts.
    *   **4.3: Your First Project:** A guided walkthrough of starting a new project from scratch using the DCE's "Cycle 0" onboarding.
*   **Capstone Project:** The final project is open-ended. Learners must conceive of their own simple application or project, document their vision, and use the full V2V workflow to build the first functional version with an AI partner.
