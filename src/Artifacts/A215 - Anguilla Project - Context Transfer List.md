# Artifact A215: Anguilla Project - Context Transfer List
# Date Created: C2
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A definitive list of files to be transferred from the `aiascent-dev` repository to the new `anguilla-project` directory. This list includes the specific project proposals and the necessary foundational context from the DCE.
- **Tags:** anguilla, setup, migration, context curation, file list

## 1. Purpose

This artifact serves as a manifest for the "Context Migration" to the new `anguilla-project` directory. It identifies not only the newly created Anguilla-specific documents but also the critical "Source of Truth" artifacts from the main project that define the methodology, philosophy, and credentials required to pitch the vision effectively.

## 2. Transfer List

### Group 1: Anguilla Project Specifics (The "What")
*These are the core planning documents and proposals created specifically for the Ministry.*

- `src/Artifacts/A200 - Anguilla Project - Universal Task Checklist.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A201 - Anguilla Project - Vision and Master Plan.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A202 - Research Proposal - The AI Capital.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A203 - Research Proposal - The Cognitive Citizenry.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A204 - Research Proposal - The Automated State.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A205 - Research Proposal - Resilient Island Systems.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A206 - Research Proposal - The Global AI Sandbox.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A207 - Strategic Presentation Guide.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A214 - Anguilla Project - GitHub Repository Setup Guide.md`

### Group 2: Methodology & Philosophy (The "How" & "Why")
*These artifacts provide the intellectual foundation for the "Citizen Architect" and "V2V" concepts referenced in the proposals. They are essential for the AI to understand the "product" being pitched.*

- `src/Artifacts/A23. aiascent.dev - Cognitive Capital Definition.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A50. V2V Academy - Core Principles & Philosophy.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A51. V2V Academy - The Virtuoso's Workflow.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A78. DCE - Whitepaper - Process as Asset.md` (Crucial proof of the methodology)
- `src/Artifacts/A115 - GlobalLogic AI Micro-Pilot Proposal.md` (Reference for the "Micro-Pilot" structure)

### Group 3: Credentials & Authority (The "Who")
*These documents establish your authority as a Google AI Trainer and DOD expert.*

- `src/Artifacts/A47 - David Gerabagi Resume (DCE Update).md`

### Group 4: System Context (The "Engine")
*These are required for the DCE extension to function correctly in the new environment and to maintain the "Artifact" workflow.*

- `src/Artifacts/A52.1 DCE - Parser Logic and AI Guidance.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A52.2 DCE - Interaction Schema Source.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A0. aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List.md` (Useful as a template/reference for starting the new A0)

## 3. Instructions for Curator

1.  **Select:** Use the DCE File Tree View or your OS file explorer to select the files listed above.
2.  **Flatten/Move:** If using the DCE "Flatten" feature, these will be concatenated into `flattened_repo.md`. Alternatively, copy these individual files directly into the `anguilla-project/artifacts/` (or equivalent) directory in the new workspace.
3.  **Initialize:** Once moved, open the new workspace and generate a `Cycle 0` prompt to initialize the new `A0 - Anguilla Project - Master Artifact List`.
