## 2. Generation Prompt

*(This prompt is to be used in conjunction with the Master System Prompt in A15.1)*

**Prompt:**

Generate a minimalist, vector-based (SVG) icon representing "Iterative Workflow" or "Cycles".

**Concept:** This icon symbolizes the continuous, cycle-based development process (prompt -> response -> test -> integrate -> repeat).

**Ideas:**

1.  A clean, circular arrow (refresh/reload symbol), perhaps with sharp, geometric edges.
2.  A stylized gear or cog, representing the machinery of the workflow.
3.  A spiral or helix shape, indicating continuous progress and iteration.

**Aesthetic Requirements:**

  * Use the Master Aesthetic (A15.1): Modern, Precise, Futuristic Minimalism.
  * Color: Primarily white/light gray, suitable for use as an icon in a dark-themed UI.
  * Style: Clean lines, recognizable shapes, optimized SVG paths.
