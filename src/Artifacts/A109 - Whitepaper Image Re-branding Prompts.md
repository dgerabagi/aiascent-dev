# Artifact A109: Whitepaper Image Re-branding Prompts
# Date Created: C107
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A comprehensive list of new, abstract image prompts for all 19 pages of the "Process as Asset" whitepaper, designed to be used with the new "likeness and style transfer" workflow for the site-wide re-branding.
- **Tags:** v2v, academy, re-branding, images, prompt engineering, whitepaper, citizen architect

## 1. Overview and Workflow

This document provides the new set of image prompts for the 19 images in the homepage's interactive whitepaper. These prompts are intentionally abstract. They are designed to be used as part of the "Likeness & Style Transfer" workflow defined in `A107 - Master Image System Prompt v2.md`.

**Workflow:**
1.  Select a **[Likeness Image]** (e.g., the male Career Transitioner).
2.  Select the **[Thematic Image]** (the original image from the whitepaper, e.g., `wp-02-executive-summary.webp`).
3.  Combine these two images with the corresponding prompt from this document to generate the new, re-branded asset.
