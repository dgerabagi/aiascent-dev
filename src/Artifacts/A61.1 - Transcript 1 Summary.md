## 1. High-Level Summary

This transcript captures a coaching session focused on onboarding two learners to the curator's AI-assisted development workflow. The curator explains the foundational concepts of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), the importance of organizing "source of truth" documents, and the distinction between static "documents" and iterative "artifacts." The session concludes with a homework assignment for the learners: to begin curating their own project data and to review the curator's past project histories as a source of inspiration and learning.

## 2. Key Learnings & Insights

*   **The Workflow is the Lesson:** The primary lesson is the workflow itself. Learning to use the DCE—curating data, creating artifacts, and iterating with an AI—is the core skill being taught.
*   **"It's All Just Text":** A recurring theme is the need to convert all forms of knowledge (PDFs, Excel sheets, ideas) into a flat, text-based format (preferably Markdown) so it can be processed by the AI.
*   **Organization Emerges Naturally:** The curator advises against over-organizing at the beginning. The best folder structure will emerge naturally as the project grows and the user discovers the most efficient way to group files for context selection (i.e., to minimize the number of checkboxes they need to click).
*   **Artifacts are Iterative; Documents are Static:** A key distinction is made. "Documents" are foundational, reference materials that don't change often. "Artifacts" are the living, iterative outputs of the AI collaboration process.
*   **The Value of Past Cycles:** The curator's own project histories (the `prompt.md` files with all their cycles) are presented as invaluable learning resources. They are a "lab guide" containing real-world examples of problems, solutions, and the evolution of the curator's own thinking.
*   **Reverse-Engineering as a Learning Tool:** The process of taking a completed project (like a perfect lesson plan) and turning it into a template is a powerful learning exercise.

## 3. Best Bits (Direct Quotes)

*   **On the core skill:**
    > "The more organized, the better, but it can be anything. Gotcha. Yep. Okay. Oh, here's an example. An artifact can even be a set of artifacts... That is literally what few-shot learning is. It's good. You just went from zero shot to one shot."

*   **On the importance of data curation:**
    > "You're just going to curate data, and then you're going to ask for code solutions, and you'll get them. The better your data is curated, the better your code solutions. Trust me."

*   **On the learning process:**
    > "When you don't know what to add, come in here and read the generated artifacts. Because these are tangential parallel problems. I was making lessons in labs for cybersecurity using KSATs and all of our same knowledge artifacts. So you'll get inspiration by sitting here and reading this, I promise you."

*   **On the nature of AI interaction:**
    > "You're building the mental model of the model right now. You're getting an idea of what one... So this is an important analogy. Think of your prompt as an input output as a single page... if you just conceptualize it as one big page both the input and the output then what you're doing is you're you're you're building a new alphabet because you now know what the input will produce the output and that's one page like one japanese letter."
