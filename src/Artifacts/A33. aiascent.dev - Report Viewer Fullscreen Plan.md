## 1. Overview and Goal

To provide a more immersive and focused reading experience, users have requested the ability to view the interactive reports in a fullscreen mode. The goal of this feature is to allow users to expand the `ReportViewer` component to fill the entire browser viewport with a single click, hiding the main website's header and footer.

## 2. User Experience Flow

1.  **Entry Point:** A new "Fullscreen" icon button will be added to the report viewer's control area (specifically, within `ImageNavigator.tsx`).
2.  **Activation:** Clicking the "Fullscreen" button will cause the `ReportViewer` component to smoothly expand and cover the entire viewport. The main site header and footer will disappear. The icon on the button will change to an "Exit Fullscreen" icon.
3.  **Interaction:** The report viewer will remain fully functional in fullscreen mode.
4.  **Deactivation:** Clicking the "Exit Fullscreen" button (or pressing the `Esc` key) will return the `ReportViewer` to its original size within the page layout, and the site header and footer will reappear.

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

### 3.1. State Management (`src/stores/reportStore.ts`)

A new state and action will be added to manage the fullscreen status globally.

*   **New State:** `isReportFullscreen: boolean` (defaulting to `false`).
*   **New Action:** `toggleReportFullscreen: () => void`. This action will simply invert the boolean value of `isReportFullscreen`.

### 3.2. UI Components

1.  **`ImageNavigator.tsx`:**
    *   A new icon button (e.g., using `FaExpand` and `FaCompress` from `react-icons`) will be added to one of the control groups.
    *   The button's `onClick` handler will call the `toggleReportFullscreen` action from the store.
    *   The icon will change based on the `isReportFullscreen` state.

2.  **`ReportViewer.tsx`:**
    *   The root `div` of the component will have its `className` determined conditionally.
    *   When `isReportFullscreen` is `true`, it will apply classes for fixed positioning, covering the viewport, and ensuring a high z-index (e.g., `fixed inset-0 z-[100] bg-background`).
    *   When `false`, it will use its standard classes for embedding within the page layout.

3.  **`app/layout.tsx`:**
    *   The root layout will need to conditionally render the `<Header />` and `<Footer />` based on the `isReportFullscreen` state.
    *   This will require converting the layout to a client component so it can subscribe to the `reportStore`.

### 3.3. Keyboard Shortcut

*   An `useEffect` hook will be added to `ReportViewer.tsx` to listen for the `Escape` key press. When detected, it will check if `isReportFullscreen` is true and, if so, call `toggleReportFullscreen` to exit the mode.
