    *   **Approach 2:** A librarian is using a futuristic interface to add digital tags to books. The tags (`Sci-Fi`, `History`, `Beginner-Friendly`) allow a robot assistant to instantly find and retrieve the right book.
*   **Page 2 (Don't Make AI Guess):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A split-panel image. On the left, a student gives a friend a pile of unlabeled, disorganized notes and asks them to write a paper; the friend looks confused. On the right, the student gives the friend a neatly organized binder with labeled tabs; the friend immediately starts writing with confidence. The friend is labeled "AI."
    *   **Approach 2:** An AI robot is trying to assemble a piece of furniture. In the first panel, it has a pile of unlabeled screws and parts and is failing. In the second panel, every part is in a clearly labeled bag, and the robot is assembling it perfectly.
*   **Page 3 (Annotation Starter Pack):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A three-panel "how-to" guide. Panel 1 shows a file being renamed from `script.js` to `user-login-api.js`. Panel 2 shows a messy desktop of files being dragged into clean folders named `_src`, `_docs`, and `_assets`. Panel 3 shows a final, clean project structure.
    *   **Approach 2:** A "before and after" of a student's project folder. "Before" is a single folder with 50 poorly named files. "After" is the same project, now with a clean, professional folder structure that a hiring manager would be impressed with.
*   **Page 4 (Building a Portfolio):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A young developer is proudly showing off a complex, polished application on their laptop screen. A glowing AI avatar is giving them a thumbs-up. The app looks clean, functional, and impressive.
    *   **Approach 2:** A gallery view of a student's portfolio. Each project is a thumbnail of a working application. The portfolio looks professional and full of high-quality work, implying that this workflow is the key to building it.

### **Lesson 2.3: Critical Analysis of AI Output**
*   **Page 1 (Don't Trust, Verify):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A young developer is confidently presenting a code review to a senior engineer. The senior engineer looks impressed, giving a nod of approval. The young developer is shown pointing out a subtle but critical bug in a piece of AI-generated code on the screen.
    *   **Approach 2:** A student is acting as a fact-checker for an essay written by an AI. They have the AI's essay on one screen and are cross-referencing its claims with reliable sources on another, highlighting a factual error.
*   **Page 2 (Spot the Bug):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A "field guide" page, like a bird-watching book. It shows different types of "bugs." One is a "Phantom Function" (a function that doesn't exist). Another is a "Logic Worm" (code that runs but gives the wrong answer). A third is a "Security Spider" (a hidden vulnerability).
    *   **Approach 2:** A detective (the developer) is at a crime scene (a piece of code). They are using a magnifying glass to find clues, which are the different types of AI errors, each represented by a different icon.
*   **Page 3 (How to Review):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A young developer is shown with a checklist, methodically reviewing a piece of code on a screen. The checklist items are "1. Understand the Goal," "2. Check the Big Picture (Diff)," "3. Read the Code," and "4. Run the Tests."
    *   **Approach 2:** A student is editing a term paper. Their process is shown: first, they check the overall essay structure, then they check each paragraph's topic sentence, and finally, they proofread for grammar line-by-line.
*   **Page 4 (Turn Bugs into Prompts):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A diagram showing a cycle. An "AI Bug" is found. An arrow points to the developer writing a "Better Prompt" that says, "Fix this bug by..." The new prompt is fed back to the AI, which produces "Better Code."
    *   **Approach 2:** A student is in a tutoring session with an AI mentor. The student shows the AI a mistake it made on a math problem. The AI then shows a new, corrected solution with a step-by-step explanation of how it fixed the original error.

## **Module 3: The Apprentice's Forge - Structured Interaction**

### **Lesson 3.1: From Conversation to Command**
*   **Page 1 (Intro):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A young developer is at their computer, looking frustrated at a screen full of messy, incorrect AI-generated code. A mentor figure points them to a clear, structured checklist, and the developer has a "lightbulb" moment of understanding.
    *   **Approach 2:** A split-panel image. On the left, someone is trying to give directions to a robot using vague hand gestures, and the robot is confused. On the right, someone gives the robot a precise, step-by-step map, and the robot immediately proceeds to the destination.
*   **Page 2 (Schema):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A clear, simple template is shown on a screen, like a form to be filled out. The fields are "1. What is the AI's Role?", "2. What is the Task?", "3. What Files Does it Need?", "4. What are the Steps?", and "5. What Should the Output Look Like?"
    *   **Approach 2:** An image of a perfect lab report template from a science class. It has all the required sections (Hypothesis, Materials, Method, Results, Conclusion), ensuring a complete and professional submission.
*   **Page 3 (Why it Gets You Hired):**
    *   **Approach 1:** An engineering manager is reviewing two portfolios. One is a messy collection of one-off scripts. The other is a clean, organized project with clear documentation and a history of structured, repeatable processes. The manager is smiling and nodding at the second one.
    *   **Approach 2:** Two job candidates are in an interview. The first explains their process with "I just kind of talk to the AI until it works." The second explains their process with "I use a structured interaction schema to define the role, context, and output, ensuring predictable results." The interviewer is clearly more impressed with the second candidate.
*   **Page 4 (Example):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A "before and after" comparison. "Before" shows a simple chat bubble: "Can you fix the login page?" "After" shows a structured command in a code-like block with clear sections for `// ROLE`, `// TASK`, `// CONTEXT`, and `// OUTPUT`.
    *   **Approach 2:** A student is writing an email to a professor. The "before" is a sloppy, informal message. The "after" is a professional, well-structured email with a clear subject line, a polite greeting, a concise question, and a professional closing.

### **Lesson 3.2: The Feedback Loop in Practice**
*   **Page 1 (First Debugging Session):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A student is shown working on a coding problem, looking confused at an error message. An AI companion points to the error, then points to the prompt input field, encouraging the student to use the error as the next input. The student has a "lightbulb" moment.
    *   **Approach 2:** A mechanic is trying to fix a car. A diagnostic computer prints out an error code. The mechanic then looks up that exact error code in a technical manual (the AI) to find the step-by-step solution.
*   **Page 2 (Field Guide to Bugs):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A simple, friendly infographic showing three types of "bugs." A "Syntax Bug" is a bug with glasses on, reading a book of rules incorrectly. A "Runtime Bug" is a bug that trips over a wire while running. A "Logic Bug" is a bug that is following a map perfectly, but the map leads to the wrong treasure.
    *   **Approach 2:** A student is in a biology class, looking at three different insects under a microscope. Each insect represents a different type of code bug, and the student is learning to identify them by their distinct characteristics.
*   **Page 3 (The Debugging Cycle):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A clear, step-by-step diagram. 1. A developer clicks "Run." 2. A red error message appears in a terminal window. 3. The developer is shown highlighting and copying the entire error message. 4. The error is pasted into the "Ephemeral Context" field of the DCE, and the developer types the new prompt: "Fix this error."
    *   **Approach 2:** A doctor-patient scene. The patient (the code) has a symptom (an error). The doctor (the developer) runs a test and gets a lab result (the stack trace). The doctor then feeds this lab result into a medical database (the AI) to get a diagnosis and treatment plan.
*   **Page 4 (Fastest Way to Learn):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A graph shows two lines. One, labeled "Traditional Learning," is a slow, steady incline. The other, labeled "V2V Feedback Loop," is a steep, upward-curving rocket, showing much faster skill acquisition.
    *   **Approach 2:** A split-panel image. On the left, a student is trying to learn guitar from a book, looking frustrated. On the right, a student is learning with a real-time feedback app (like Rocksmith) that instantly shows them their mistakes, and they are progressing much faster.

### **Lesson 3.3: The Test-and-Revert Workflow**
*   **Page 1 (Safety Net):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A young developer is shown confidently working on a complex project. To their side is a prominent, glowing "UNDO" button. They are applying a large, complex piece of AI-generated code to their project, smiling because they know they can instantly revert it if it breaks anything.
    *   **Approach 2:** A student is in a chemistry lab, mixing volatile chemicals. However, they are working inside a protective fume hood, which protects them from any potential negative reactions. The fume hood is labeled "Git Workflow."
*   **Page 2 (AI is Unpredictable):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A diagram shows a developer asking an AI for a piece of code. The AI, represented as a friendly but slightly chaotic robot, offers three different code snippets. One has a green checkmark, but the other two have hidden red bug icons. A shield labeled "Git Baseline" protects the developer.
    *   **Approach 2:** A student is using a "spell checker" AI. For one sentence, it gives a perfect suggestion. For the next, it suggests a grammatically correct but nonsensical word. The image illustrates that the AI's suggestions are not always correct and must be verified.
*   **Page 3 (Validation Process):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A clear, four-step flowchart. 1. **Baseline:** A developer clicks a "Baseline (Commit)" button, creating a "Save Point." 2. **Accept:** The developer clicks "Accept Selected" to apply the AI's code. 3. **Test:** The developer runs the code, and a big "TEST FAILED" message appears. 4. **Restore:** The developer clicks a "Restore Baseline" button, and the project is instantly clean again.
    *   **Approach 2:** A student is writing an important essay. The workflow is shown: 1. Save the current draft. 2. Accept a major revision from a grammar tool. 3. Re-read the new version to see if it makes sense. 4. If it's bad, close without saving and reopen the last good version.
*   **Page 4 (Build Faster):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A graph shows two learning curves. The "Cautious Coder" curve is slow and flat. The "V2V Developer" curve is steep and upward, showing rapid progress. The V2V curve is made of bold upward spikes ("Experiments") and tiny, quick dips ("Reverts").
    *   **Approach 2:** Two students are building a complex Lego model. The first is building very slowly, triple-checking every piece before placing it. The second is building very fast, trying bold ideas, because they know they can easily take sections apart and rebuild them if they make a mistake.

### **Lesson 4.1: Defining Your Vision**
*   **Page 1 (Portfolio Starts Here):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A hiring manager is reviewing a recent graduate's portfolio. They are zoomed in on a well-written, professional Project Scope document, looking very impressed. The document is the first item in the portfolio.
    *   **Approach 2:** An image of a "Project Kickoff" meeting at a tech company. A young engineer is confidently presenting their Project Scope document on a large screen to their team lead.
*   **Page 2 (Cool Idea to Plan):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A three-panel diagram. Panel 1: A lightbulb labeled "Cool Idea!" Panel 2: A series of question marks around the lightbulb ("Who is this for?", "What problem does it solve?"). Panel 3: A simple, clear blueprint labeled "Actionable Plan."
    *   **Approach 2:** A student is writing a research paper. Their process is shown: first, they have a broad topic, then they narrow it down with research questions, and finally, they create a detailed outline.
*   **Page 3 (MVP Strategy):**
    *   **Approach 1:** An image showing two paths. One, labeled "Build Everything," leads to an unfinished, complex mess of code. The other, labeled "Build the MVP," leads to a small but complete, polished, and working application.
    *   **Approach 2:** A student is building a model rocket for a science fair. Instead of trying to build a multi-stage rocket with a payload for the first attempt, they are focused on building a simple, single-stage rocket that is guaranteed to launch successfully.
*   **Page 4 (First Artifact):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A student is shown using the DCE to create their first artifact: `A1 - Project Scope.md`. The document is structured with clear headings for "Vision Statement," "Problem," "User Persona," and "MVP Features."
    *   **Approach 2:** A "before and after." "Before" is a blank document. "After" is the same document, now filled out with a complete, professional project scope, ready to be added to a portfolio.

### **Lesson 4.2: The Blank Page Problem**
*   **Page 1 (The Challenge):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A recent graduate sits in front of a computer with a completely empty code editor, looking overwhelmed and uncertain. Question marks float around their head.
    *   **Approach 2:** An artist is staring at a large, blank white canvas, experiencing "artist's block" and not knowing where to make the first stroke.
*   **Page 2 (The Solution):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A developer hands their "Project Scope" document to a friendly AI robot. The robot reads the document and then quickly assembles a perfect, clean "skeleton" of a project, complete with a folder structure and initial files.
    *   **Approach 2:** A writer is stuck. They feed their story outline to an AI, which then generates the first few paragraphs of the story, giving the writer a starting point to build upon.
*   **Page 3 (Case Study):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A close-up of the DCE extension's UI in "Cycle 0." It shows a user typing their project scope. An arrow points to a generated `prompt.md` file, which then leads to a neatly organized `src/Artifacts` folder filled with new planning documents.
    *   **Approach 2:** An animation shows a student planting a "Project Scope" seed. The DCE tool waters it, and it instantly sprouts into a small but fully formed "Project Tree" with branches for `/src`, `/docs`, etc.
*   **Page 4 (First Command):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A developer is shown confidently typing a clear prompt into their AI chat. The prompt instructs the AI to use their Project Scope to generate a complete starter project for a Next.js application, including all the initial folders and config files.
    *   **Approach 2:** A student is working with a tutor (the AI). The student gives the tutor their essay outline, and the tutor helps them create the initial document with the title page, bibliography, and section headings already in place.

### **Lesson 4.3: Architecting Your MVP**
*   **Page 1 (Blueprint):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A student presents their "Project Scope" document to a friendly AI robot. The robot processes the document and generates a perfect, professional-looking "Architectural Blueprint" for a software project, showing a clean folder structure and key components.
    *   **Approach 2:** A home builder is given a client's list of desired features (the scope). They then use a computer program (the AI) to generate a detailed architectural blueprint, translating the client's wishes into a technical plan.
*   **Page 2 (AI as Senior Dev):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A side-by-side comparison. On the left, a student is struggling, manually creating folders and empty files with generic names. On the right, a student gives a single command to an AI, which instantly generates a complete, perfectly organized project with folders like `/components`, `/lib`, and `/app`.
    *   **Approach 2:** A student is learning to cook. Instead of figuring out all the prep work themselves, a master chef (the AI) has already chopped all the vegetables and measured all the ingredients, allowing the student to focus on the creative process of combining them.
*   **Page 3 (The Prompt):**
    *   **Approach 1:** A developer is shown typing a clear, concise prompt. The prompt is: "Act as a senior Next.js developer. Use my Project Scope to scaffold the complete starter project using the App Router, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS."
    *   **Approach 2:** A student is ordering a custom computer online. They are using a configuration tool, carefully selecting the "Expert" build option and specifying all their required components (tech stack) before clicking "Build."
*   **Page 4 (Cycle 1):**
    *   **Approach 1:** The new project structure is shown inside the DCE. The developer clicks "Accept Selected," and the files appear in their VS Code explorer. The final shot shows them typing `npm run dev` in the terminal and seeing a "Welcome to Next.js" page in their browser.
    *   **Approach 2:** A student receives a "build-it-yourself" furniture kit (the AI's response). They follow the instructions to assemble it ("Accept" and `npm install`). The final image shows them with their new, fully assembled, and functional desk (`npm run dev`).
