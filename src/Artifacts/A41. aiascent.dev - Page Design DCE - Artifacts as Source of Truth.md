# Artifact A41: aiascent.dev - Page Design DCE - Artifacts as Source of Truth

# Date Created: C53
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan for a new section on the `/dce` page explaining how generating documentation artifacts is a core feature of the DCE workflow, establishing them as the project's "source of truth."
- **Tags:** page design, dce, features, plan, source of truth, documentation, artifacts

## 1. Overview and Goal

The `/dce` page currently explains the core workflow features of the Data Curation Environment (DCE). A key philosophical and practical aspect is missing: the concept of using the AI to generate documentation artifacts *first*, establishing these documents as the project's "source of truth."

The goal is to add a new section to the `/dce` page that clearly explains this "documentation-first" principle and its benefits, reinforcing the strategic value of the DCE beyond simple code generation.

## 2. Page Structure and Content

This new section will be added to `src/app/dce/page.tsx` as the fourth `MissionSectionBlock`, appearing before the final "Next Up" link.

### **New Section: Artifacts as the Source of Truth**

*   **Title:** Artifacts as the Source of Truth
*   **TL;DR:** The DCE workflow inverts the traditional development process. By instructing the AI to create planning and documentation artifacts first, the process itself becomes a transparent, auditable, and durable asset.
*   **Content:** A core feature of the DCE is its "documentation-first" methodology. Instead of asking an AI to simply write code, the workflow begins by instructing it to create artifacts: project plans, design documents, and strategic memos that define the "why" and "how" of a task. These artifacts become the immutable "source of truth" that guides all subsequent code generation. This process ensures that human intent is clearly captured and that the AI's work is always aligned with the project's strategic goals. It transforms the development process from a series of ephemeral prompts into a permanent, auditable knowledge graph where every decision is traceable and every line of code has a documented purpose.
*   **Image Side:** Right
*   **Asset Wishlist:** A new GIF, `dce-feature-artifacts.gif`, showing the user in the PCPP, generating a `prompt.md` which is then used to generate a new `AXX-New-Feature-Plan.md` artifact file.
