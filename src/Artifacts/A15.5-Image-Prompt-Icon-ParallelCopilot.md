## 2. Generation Prompt

*(This prompt is to be used in conjunction with the Master System Prompt in A15.1)*

**Prompt:**

Generate a minimalist, vector-based (SVG) icon representing "Parallel Co-Pilot".

**Concept:** This icon symbolizes the comparison and testing of multiple AI responses simultaneously.

**Ideas:**

1.  Two or three vertical rectangles side-by-side (representing panels or windows), perhaps with slight variations to indicate different options.
2.  A branching path or diverging arrows, symbolizing multiple potential solutions stemming from a single point.
3.  A stylized "compare" or "diff" icon (e.g., two overlapping squares with differences highlighted).

**Aesthetic Requirements:**

  * Use the Master Aesthetic (A15.1): Modern, Precise, Futuristic Minimalism.
  * Color: Primarily white/light gray, suitable for use as an icon in a dark-themed UI.
  * Style: Clean lines, recognizable shapes, optimized SVG paths.
