## 1. Title: Resilient Island Systems: AI for Sustainability and Survival

## 2. Problem Statement
As a small island nation, Anguilla is on the front lines of climate change. It faces existential risks from hurricanes, rising sea levels, and resource scarcity (specifically fresh water and energy). Managing these fragile systems requires precise, real-time decision-making that human intuition alone cannot provide.

## 3. Research Objectives
1.  **Resource Modeling:** Gather data on the island's water table, desalination capacity, and energy grid load profiles.
2.  **Climate Vulnerability Assessment:** Identify the specific infrastructure points most at risk from extreme weather events.
3.  **Sensor Network Feasibility:** Determine the cost and logistics of deploying IoT sensors across the island's utility networks to feed data to an AI model.

## 4. Proposed Solution: The Anguilla Digital Twin
We propose creating a **Digital Twin** of the island's critical infrastructure—a live, AI-powered simulation.
*   **Predictive Resource Management:** AI models that predict water and energy demand based on tourism numbers and weather forecasts, optimizing desalination and power generation to reduce waste and cost.
*   **Hurricane Response Simulation:** A system that can run thousands of hurricane scenarios to predict damage, optimize evacuation routes, and pre-position emergency supplies before a storm hits.
*   **Smart Grid Optimization:** Managing the integration of renewable energy (solar/wind) into the island's grid to maximize stability and minimize reliance on imported diesel.

## 5. Impact
*   **Sustainability:** Drastically reduces waste and energy costs.
*   **Safety:** Saves lives by improving disaster preparedness and response.
*   **Global Model:** Establishes Anguilla as a global leader in "Climate Tech," attracting research funding and partnerships from nations facing similar threats.
