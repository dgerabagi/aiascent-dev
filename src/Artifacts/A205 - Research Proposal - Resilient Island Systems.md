## 1. Title: Resilient Island Systems: AI for Water Security and Survival

## 2. Problem Statement
As a small island nation, Anguilla is on the front lines of climate change. It faces existential risks from hurricanes, rising sea levels, and most critically, **fresh water scarcity**. Managing these fragile systems requires precise, real-time decision-making that human intuition alone cannot provide. Traditional resource management is reactive; survival requires proactive, predictive modeling.

## 3. Research Objectives
1.  **Resource Modeling:** Gather granular data on the island's water table, desalination capacity, energy grid load profiles, and food supply chains.
2.  **Climate Vulnerability Assessment:** Identify specific infrastructure points most at risk from extreme weather events and sea-level rise.
3.  **Sensor Network Feasibility:** Determine the cost and logistics of deploying IoT sensors across the island's utility networks to feed real-time data to an AI model.

## 4. Proposed Solution: The Anguilla Digital Twin
We propose creating a **Digital Twin** of the island's critical infrastructure—a live, AI-powered simulation.
*   **AI-Optimized Desalination:** Using machine learning to predict water demand and optimize desalination plant energy usage, reducing costs and ensuring water security during droughts.
*   **Hurricane Response Simulation:** A system that can run thousands of hurricane scenarios to predict damage, optimize evacuation routes, and pre-position emergency supplies before a storm hits.
*   **Smart Grid & Microgrids:** Managing the integration of renewable energy (solar/wind) into the island's grid. The AI will manage microgrids that can "island" themselves off from the main grid during a storm, keeping critical services (hospitals, shelters) powered even if the main lines go down.
*   **Heritage Site Protection:** Modeling the impact of sea-level rise on cultural heritage sites to prioritize preservation efforts.

## 5. Impact
*   **Survival:** Drastically improves water and energy security, saving lives during disasters.
*   **Sustainability:** Reduces waste and reliance on imported fossil fuels.
*   **Cultural Preservation:** Protects physical heritage sites from climate erasure.
*   **Global Model:** Establishes Anguilla as a global leader in "Climate Tech" and adaptation strategies.
