## 1. Project Vision

The vision for "Course 1: The AI-Powered Report Viewer" is to create the V2V Academy's flagship, project-based learning experience. This course will guide students through the entire process of building a complex, AI-native application from the ground up, using the same tools and methodologies taught in the V2V curriculum. The Report Viewer is the perfect subject for this course, as it is a keystone generative AI artifact that embodies every core principle of the V2V pathway.

This course will be the first monetizable product for the Academy, offering a deep, hands-on experience that provides immense value to students and serves as a tangible demonstration of the power of the DCE workflow.

## 2. Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.  **Architect an AI-Native Application:** Deconstruct a high-level requirement into a set of structured data models and planning artifacts.
2.  **Generate a Frontend with AI:** Use the DCE workflow to guide an AI in building a complete, interactive frontend with React and Next.js.
3.  **Integrate AI Services:** Build and integrate backend services for core generative AI functionalities, including:
    *   Text-to-Speech (TTS) generation.
    *   Automated image generation.
    *   A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered chatbot.
4.  **Master the Virtuoso's Loop:** Apply the full, end-to-end V2V workflow—including context curation, parallel prompting, and Git-integrated testing—to a real-world project.
5.  **Deploy a Full-Stack Application:** Understand the basics of deploying a modern web application.

## 3. Target Audience

This course will be designed with our three core learner personas in mind, with the content and exercises framed to meet their specific goals:

*   **The Career Transitioner:** Will learn how to architect and lead the development of a modern AI application, a key leadership skill.
*   **The Underequipped Graduate:** Will build a highly impressive, portfolio-worthy project that demonstrates a wide range of in-demand AI development skills.
*   **The Young Precocious:** Will be challenged to build a complex, multi-faceted system, channeling their creative energy into a structured engineering project.

## 4. Phased Course Development Roadmap

The development of the course content will follow a phased approach.

### **Phase 1: Curriculum & Lab Design (Documentation First)**

*   **Goal:** Create the complete set of planning artifacts that will define the course.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Create the detailed Curriculum Outline (`A100`).
    2.  Create the detailed Lab Plan (`A101`), breaking down the project into step-by-step exercises.
    3.  Generate all necessary image prompts and asset wishlists.

### **Phase 2: Content Creation**

*   **Goal:** Write the full text and create all media for the course lessons and labs.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Write the persona-specific content for each lesson defined in the curriculum outline.
    2.  Create all necessary screenshots and screen recordings (GIFs/MP4s) for the lab steps.
    3.  Generate all AI images required for the lessons.
    4.  Consolidate all content into the final JSON data files for the `ReportViewer`.

### **Phase 3: Platform Integration & Launch**

*   **Goal:** Integrate the course into the `aiascent.dev` platform and launch it.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Update the `/academy` page to feature the new course prominently.
    2.  (Future) Integrate with a payment and authentication system to handle enrollment for this paid course.
    3.  Announce and launch the course to the community.
