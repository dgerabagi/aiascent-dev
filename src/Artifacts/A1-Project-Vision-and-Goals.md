## 1. Project Vision

The vision of **aiascent.dev** is to create a professional, engaging, and authoritative promotional website for the **Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension**. It will serve as the primary public-facing hub for the DCE project, clearly articulating its value proposition and demonstrating its power. It aims to be more than a static landing page; it will be a living testament to the capabilities of the DCE by showcasing complex, interactive components that were themselves built using the extension.

## 2. High-Level Goals & Phases

The project will be developed in distinct phases to ensure an iterative and manageable workflow.

### Phase 1: Core Website and Interactive Showcase

The goal of this phase is to establish the foundational website and deliver the primary showcase content.
-   **Core Functionality:**
-   Set up a modern, statically generated website using Next.js and TailwindCSS.
-   Create a compelling landing page that explains the DCE's purpose and benefits.
-   Develop an "Interactive Showcase" (e.g., an interactive whitepaper or a visualization of the DCE workflow) that demonstrates a complex product built using the DCE.
-   **Outcome:** A functional, deployed website at aiascent.dev where visitors can learn about the DCE and interact with a live demonstration of its capabilities.

### Phase 2: Educational Content and Tutorials

This phase will build upon the foundation by adding educational content to foster adoption and teach the AI-assisted development methodology.
-   **Core Functionality:**
-   Create a dedicated section for tutorials and guides.
-   Develop the first set of tutorials explaining how to set up and use the DCE, focusing on the "vibe coding" workflow.
-   Implement a simple blog or articles section for development updates and conceptual deep-dives.
-   **Outcome:** The website becomes a key educational resource for developers wanting to master AI-assisted development with the DCE.

### Phase 3: Community Hub and Downloads

This phase focuses on community building and deeper integration with the DCE ecosystem.
-   **Core Functionality:**
-   Integrate community links (e.g., Discord, GitHub Discussions).
-   Create a showcase of projects built with the DCE.
-   Provide direct download links and installation instructions for the DCE extension's `.vsix` file.
-   **Outcome:** aiascent.dev becomes the central community and distribution hub for the Data Curation Environment project.
