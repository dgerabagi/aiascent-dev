# Artifact A215: Anguilla Project - Migration Manifest
# Date Created: C2
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A curated list of files to migrate from the `aiascent-dev` repository to the new `anguilla-project` repository. This selection ensures the new context possesses the necessary "notions" regarding V2V methodology, Cognitive Capital, and the curator's background.
- **Tags:** anguilla, migration, setup, context curation, manifest

## 1. Purpose

This manifest lists the specific files that should be selected and flattened into a single `flattened_repo.md` for migration to the `anguilla-project` directory. Transferring these files ensures the AI in the new project has the full context of your philosophy, methodology, and credibility.

## 2. File List for Migration

### Group 1: Anguilla Project Core (The Strategy)
*These are the specific plans created for this initiative.*
- `src/Artifacts/A200 - Anguilla Project - Universal Task Checklist.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A201 - Anguilla Project - Vision and Master Plan.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A202 - Research Proposal - The AI Capital.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A203 - Research Proposal - The Cognitive Citizenry.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A204 - Research Proposal - The Automated State.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A205 - Research Proposal - Resilient Island Systems.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A206 - Research Proposal - The Global AI Sandbox.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A207 - Strategic Presentation Guide.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A214 - Anguilla Project - GitHub Repository Setup Guide.md`

### Group 2: Methodology & Philosophy (The "Notions")
*These files explain "Process as Asset," "Cognitive Capital," and the V2V workflow. They are the intellectual engine of the proposal.*
- `src/Artifacts/A50 - V2V Academy - Core Principles & Philosophy.md` (Defines "AI as Feedback Loop" and "Star Trek Motivation")
- `src/Artifacts/A51 - V2V Academy - The Virtuoso's Workflow.md` (The "Documentation First" process)
- `src/Artifacts/A78. DCE - Whitepaper - Process as Asset.md` (Crucial for explaining the value prop to government stakeholders)
- `context/dce/dce_kb.md` (The manual for the DCE tool itself, essential for the "Automated State" pitch)

### Group 3: Personal Credibility & Context (The Authority)
*These files establish your background, the "Citizen Architect" story, and your geopolitical awareness.*
- `context/personal/dgerabagi_resume.md` (Establishes your credentials with Google/DOD)
- `context/personal/personal-journey-to-learn-ai-transcript.txt` (Your origin story)
- `context/v2v/audio-transcripts/1-on-1-training/transcript-11.md` (Contains the "AI Cold War" and "National Security" context)
- `src/Artifacts/A115 - GlobalLogic AI Micro-Pilot Proposal.md` (A template for pitching pilot programs)

### Group 4: System Artifacts (The Engine)
*These are required for the DCE extension to parse your prompts correctly in the new repository.*
- `src/Artifacts/A52.1 DCE - Parser Logic and AI Guidance.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A52.2 DCE - Interaction Schema Source.md`
- `src/Artifacts/A52.3 DCE - Harmony Interaction Schema Source.md`

## 3. Instructions
1.  Open the DCE Context Chooser.
2.  Select the files listed above.
3.  Click **"Flatten Context"**.
4.  Move the generated `flattened_repo.md` to the `anguilla-project` directory.
5.  (Optional) Rename it to `context_bootstrap.md` to distinguish it from future flattened files in the new repo.
