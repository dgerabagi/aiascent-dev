# Date Created: C104
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan to revamp the homepage's hero section to more effectively communicate the core value proposition of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), focusing on the "vibe code for free" angle.
- **Tags:** page design, home page, hero section, plan, marketing, content, image prompts

## 1. Overview and Goal

Based on feedback regarding "burying the lead," this plan outlines a revamp of the `aiascent.dev` homepage hero section. The goal is to immediately and forcefully communicate the single most compelling value proposition of the Data Curation Environment (DCE): **it enables developers to leverage powerful, free AI tools like Google's AI Studio for complex, multi-file coding projects.**

This revamp will involve updating the headline and sub-headline, and adding a new, visually distinct three-column feature section directly below the main call-to-action buttons to explain this core workflow.

## 2. Proposed Content Changes for `HeroSection.tsx`

### 2.1. Updated Text Content

*   **Headline:**
    > Vibe Code for Free. Ship Real Projects.
*   **Sub-headline:**
    > Stop paying for expensive AI assistants. The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the only tool you need to package your entire VS Code project for Google's free AI Studio, unlocking powerful, unlimited AI collaboration.

### 2.2. New "How It Works" Section

A new three-column section will be added below the "Explore the Showcase" and "Download Now" buttons, but *before* the `ContainerScroll` animation. This places the core value proposition directly "above the fold."

*   **Section Headline:**
    > The Free Workflow for Serious AI Development
*   **Column 1:**
    *   **Icon:** A new icon representing "Curation."
    *   **Title:** Curate Your Code
    *   **Description:** Visually select any file in your project. DCE intelligently packages everything into a single, clean prompt ready for any AI.
*   **Column 2:**
    *   **Icon:** A new icon representing "Freedom/Free."
    *   **Title:** Use Any Free AI
    *   **Description:** Take your perfectly curated context to any AI, including the free, powerful models in Google's AI Studio.
*   **Column 3:**
    *   **Icon:** A new icon representing "Creation/Building."
    *   **Title:** Build Without Limits
    *   **Description:** Get unlimited, high-quality code and documentation from the world's best models, without spending a dime on API fees.

## 3. New Asset Wishlist

To support this revamp, new visual assets are required. These prompts should be used with the master system prompt (`A15.1`) and should draw inspiration from the high-quality, consistent aesthetic achieved for the "Young Precocious" persona.

| ID | Asset Name | Description | Format | Prompt |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AS-08** | **Hero Visual: The Free Workflow** | A new primary hero image to replace or supplement the `pcp.gif`. It should visually represent the entire value proposition in a single, powerful image. | WEBP | A hyper-realistic, cinematic image of a 'Citizen Architect' in a solarpunk-inspired home office. They are looking at a holographic display showing a complex VS Code project. Glowing lines of data are flowing from the VS Code window, through a spiral DCE logo, and into a browser window showing the Google AI Studio interface. The mood is one of empowerment, focus, and effortless creation. The aesthetic matches the 'Young Precocious' persona: clean, futuristic, with vibrant accents. |
| **AS-09** | **Icon: Curate** | An icon for the "Curate Your Code" feature column. | SVG | A minimalist, vector-based icon showing a file tree structure on the left with several checkboxes ticked. From these checked items, clean lines converge into a single, streamlined data packet on the right. The style is clean, precise, and uses the site's electric blue accent color. |
| **AS-10** | **Icon: Free** | An icon for the "Use Any Free AI" feature column. | SVG | A minimalist, vector-based icon representing 'free.' A dollar sign is shown inside a 'prohibited' circle, but the circle is made of a glowing, positive blue light and is open at the top, suggesting freedom and breaking limits rather than simple restriction. The style is clean and modern. |
| **AS-11** | **Icon: Build** | An icon for the "Build Without Limits" feature column. | SVG | A minimalist, vector-based icon showing a complex, beautiful digital structure (like a wireframe of a futuristic building) being constructed by a swarm of small, glowing AI bots. The icon should convey creation, complexity, and automation. |

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Generate Assets:** The curator will generate the new images and icons based on the prompts above and place them in the `public/assets/` directory.
2.  **Update `HeroSection.tsx`:**
    *   Replace the main headline and sub-headline text.
    *   Add a new `div` after the CTA buttons to contain the three-column layout.
    *   Implement the three columns using Flexbox or CSS Grid, each containing the new icon, title, and description.
3.  **Update `ContainerScroll`:**
    *   The `ContainerScroll` component, which currently displays the `pcp.gif`, will now be positioned *below* this new three-column section.
    *   The new `AS-08` Hero Visual could potentially replace the `pcp.gif` inside the `ContainerScroll` for a more static but visually impactful presentation.
