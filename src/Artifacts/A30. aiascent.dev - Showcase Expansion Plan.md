## 1. Overview and Goal

The `/showcase` page currently serves as the home for the interactive "Ascent Report." To broaden the demonstration of what can be built with the Data Curation Environment (DCE), the user has requested an expansion to also showcase `aiascent.game`.

The goal of this plan is to refactor the `/showcase` page into a tabbed interface. This design will allow users to easily switch between different showcased projects, starting with the report and the game, while creating an extensible pattern for adding more projects in the future.

## 2. Design and UI/UX

The page will be modified to include a simple, clean tab navigation bar at the top, directly below the main site header. The rest of the page content area will be dedicated to rendering the currently selected tab's content.

### 2.1. Tab Navigation

*   **Location:** At the top of the main content area on `/showcase`.
*   **Tabs:**
    1.  **The Ascent Report:** This will be the default active tab.
    2.  **AI Ascent Game:** The second tab.
*   **Styling:** The tabs will be styled to match the site's aesthetic. The active tab will be clearly indicated (e.g., with a bottom border in the primary color and bolder text).

### 2.2. Tab Content

*   **The Ascent Report:** This tab will render the existing `<ReportViewer reportName="showcase" />` component, filling the entire content area. The user experience for the report will remain unchanged.
*   **AI Ascent Game:** This tab will render an `<iframe>` that fills the entire content area. The `src` of the iframe will be `https://aiascent.game/`. This will embed the live game directly into the showcase page, allowing users to interact with it seamlessly.

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **Create `ShowcaseTabs.tsx` Component:**
    *   A new client component will be created at `src/components/showcase/ShowcaseTabs.tsx`.
    *   This component will use a `useState` hook to manage the `activeTab` (defaulting to `'report'`).
    *   It will render the tab buttons and conditionally render the content for the active tab.
    *   The `ReportViewer` will be rendered for the `'report'` tab.
    *   An `<iframe>` will be rendered for the `'game'` tab. The iframe should be styled to be responsive and fill the available space (`className="w-full h-full border-0"`).

2.  **Update `showcase/page.tsx`:**
    *   The existing content of the showcase page will be replaced with the new `<ShowcaseTabs />` component.
    *   The page will no longer render the `ReportViewer` directly.

3.  **Extensibility (Future Consideration):**
    *   The `ShowcaseTabs.tsx` component can be easily extended in the future by adding new objects to a `tabs` array configuration. Each object would define an `id`, `label`, and the component or content to render.

This plan provides a clean, user-friendly, and technically straightforward path to expanding the showcase, making it a more comprehensive portfolio of projects built with the DCE.
