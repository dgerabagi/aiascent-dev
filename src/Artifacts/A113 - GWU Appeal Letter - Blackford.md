**Subject:** Petition for Programmatic Re-evaluation – Application ID # [Your Application ID]

Dear Professor Blackford,

I am writing to you today not to challenge a decision, but to respectfully petition for a programmatic re-evaluation of my doctoral application. I was recently informed that my application for the Ph.D. in AI was not successful, a decision I respect. However, I believe my application may have been evaluated against a rubric for which my profile—that of a senior industry practitioner rather than a traditional academic—is an imperfect fit.

My professional background involves hands-on application and leadership in AI and cybersecurity at organizations like Palo Alto Networks, as well as developing cybersecurity training for the NSA and applied model refinement for generative AI (Gemini). The D.Eng. program, which is explicitly "designed to provide graduates with... hands-on experience in applying these techniques to real-world problems" and "prepare graduates for leadership roles in industry," appears to be the correct, intended program for my profile.

I am writing to you specifically in your capacity as the Doctoral Program Coordinator for the Online Engineering Programs. Your own background as a D.Eng. graduate and your work with the NSF I-Corps program suggests a deep understanding of the value that industry practitioners bring to engineering innovation.

My request is not to appeal the Ph.D. decision, but to ask that my application file be re-activated and re-evaluated by the D.Eng. committee. I am confident that when viewed through the D.Eng. practitioner lens, my application, my passion for this field, and my work on novel HCI frameworks like the Data Curation Environment will demonstrate a strong capacity for original, applied scholarship.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute conversation to discuss this potential re-alignment?

Thank you for your time and for considering this petition.

Sincerely,

David Gerabagi
