**Subject:** Petition for Programmatic Re-evaluation – Application ID # [Your Application ID]

Dear Professor Blackford,

I am writing to you today not to challenge a decision, but to respectfully petition for a programmatic re-evaluation of my doctoral application. I was recently informed that my application for the Ph.D. in AI program was unsuccessful. While an alternative in Cybersecurity was offered, my singular passion and research focus is on AI, and I had to decline.

I believe my application was a "type mismatch." My profile is that of a senior industry practitioner with a deep passion for building novel AI-native systems, not a traditional academic. My life's mission is to develop the frameworks that empower people to collaborate with AI, increasing our collective "Cognitive Capital" and accelerating our ability to solve major world problems.

My entire purpose in applying to GWU was to pursue the **Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.)**, a degree I believe is perfectly aligned with my practitioner profile. I am writing to you specifically in your capacity as the Doctoral Program Coordinator for the Online Engineering Programs. Your own background as a D.Eng. graduate and your work with the NSF I-Corps program suggest a deep understanding of the value that industry practitioners bring to engineering innovation.

My request is to have my application file re-activated and re-evaluated by the D.Eng. committee for the D.Eng. in AI & Machine Learning. I am not a traditional applicant; I am an innovator who has already architected and built a novel HCI framework for AI development, the Data Curation Environment. This work is a prime example of the original, applied scholarship that the D.Eng. program champions.

I am confident that when viewed through the D.Eng. practitioner lens, my application will demonstrate a level of passion, drive, and proven capability that would be a significant asset to your program.

Thank you for your time and for considering this petition for programmatic re-alignment.

Sincerely,

David Gerabagi
