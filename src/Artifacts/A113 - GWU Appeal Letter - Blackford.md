**Subject:** Petition for Programmatic Re-evaluation – Application ID # [Your Application ID]

Dear Professor Blackford,

I am writing to you today not to challenge a decision, but to respectfully petition for a programmatic re-evaluation of my doctoral application. I was recently informed that my application for the Ph.D. in AI program was unsuccessful. While an alternative in Cybersecurity was offered, my singular passion and research focus is on AI, and I had to decline.

I believe my application was a "type mismatch." My profile is that of a senior industry practitioner with a deep passion for building novel AI-native systems, not a traditional academic. My life's mission is to develop the frameworks that empower people to collaborate with AI, increasing our collective "Cognitive Capital" and accelerating our ability to solve major world problems.

To this end, I architected and built the **Data Curation Environment (DCE)**, a novel Human-Computer Interaction framework for AI development. It transforms the workflow into a structured, auditable engineering discipline. The tangible result of this work is live at **<https://aiascent.dev>**, a project built entirely with the DCE. This framework has already been recognized by senior practitioners, including a colleague from the NSA's **Offensive Cyber Operations**, as a tool that would "immensely" improve their high-stakes workflow.

My entire purpose in applying to GWU was to pursue the **Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.)**. I am writing to you specifically in your capacity as the Doctoral Program Coordinator. Your own background as a D.Eng. graduate and your work with the NSF I-Corps program suggest a deep understanding of the value that industry practitioners bring to engineering innovation.

My request is to have my application file re-activated and re-evaluated by the D.Eng. committee for the D.Eng. in AI & Machine Learning. I am confident that when viewed through the D.Eng. practitioner lens, my application—supported by a live, complex software project and validation from the national security community—demonstrates a strong capacity for the original, applied scholarship that the D.Eng. program champions.

Thank you for your time and for considering this petition for programmatic re-alignment.

Sincerely,

David Gerabagi
