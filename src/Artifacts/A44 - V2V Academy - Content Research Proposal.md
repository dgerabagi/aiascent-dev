# Artifact A44: V2V Academy - Content Research Proposal
# Date Created: C55
# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A formal proposal outlining a research plan to discover, analyze, and synthesize existing public content related to the "prompt engineering to context engineering" paradigm and other V2V methodologies.
- **Tags:** research, content strategy, curriculum, prompt engineering, context engineering

## 1. Introduction & Rationale

The "Vibecoding to Virtuosity" (V2V) curriculum is founded on the premise that the apex skill in human-AI collaboration is the shift from simple "prompt engineering" to holistic "context engineering." To build a world-class curriculum, we must supplement our own 1-on-1 training transcripts with the broader academic, industry, and open-source discourse on this topic.

This proposal outlines a structured research plan to identify, harvest, and synthesize publicly available knowledge that aligns with our methodology. The findings will enrich our curriculum, validate our approach, and ensure our training is at the forefront of AI development practices.

## 2. Research Objectives

1.  **Identify Core Concepts:** To find and document how others in the field are defining the transition from basic prompting to advanced context management.
2.  **Discover Methodologies:** To uncover structured approaches, frameworks, or "rules of thumb" that others have developed for context engineering.
3.  **Harvest Best Practices:** To collect concrete examples, case studies, and best practices for curating and structuring context for complex tasks.
4.  **Source Curriculum Inspiration:** To analyze how others are teaching these advanced concepts, gathering ideas for lesson structure, exercises, and examples.

## 3. Research Methodology

The research will be conducted in three phases: Discovery, Analysis, and Synthesis.

### Phase 3.1: Discovery - Search & Harvest

This phase focuses on broad information gathering. The curator will use the following search queries and explore the specified sources. All relevant findings will be saved as markdown files in the `context/v2v/research` directory.

**Primary Search Queries:**
*   "context engineering vs prompt engineering"
*   "advanced retrieval-augmented generation techniques"
*   "structuring context for large language models"
*   "AI context window management strategies"
*   "human-AI collaborative development workflow"
*   "cognitive apprenticeship with AI"
*   "AI-assisted software architecture"

**Sources to Investigate:**
*   **Academic Databases:** arXiv, Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library.
*   **Technical Blogs:** High-traffic engineering blogs from companies like OpenAI, Google AI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and influential AI startups.
*   **Community Platforms:** Hacker News, relevant subreddits (e.g., r/LocalLLaMA, r/MachineLearning), and Medium articles with high engagement.
*   **Open Source Projects:** GitHub repositories for AI agent frameworks, RAG implementations, and development tools that have detailed documentation or associated whitepapers.
*   **Video Platforms:** YouTube and conference talk recordings (e.g., from NeurIPS, ICML) for presentations on these topics.

### Phase 3.2: Analysis

Once the raw research material is collected, the AI assistant (Gemini) will be tasked with reviewing each markdown file. For each source, the AI will create a "synopsis artifact" that includes:
*   A brief summary of the source's main argument.
*   A list of key concepts and definitions.
*   An extraction of any structured methodologies or actionable advice.
*   An assessment of its relevance to the V2V curriculum.

### Phase 3.3: Synthesis

With the synopses created, the AI will perform a final synthesis. It will be prompted to analyze all the synopses and generate a "meta-analysis" artifact that:
*   Identifies the common themes and patterns across all research.
*   Outlines a proposed structure for a course module on "Context Engineering."
*   Suggests specific examples, exercises, and case studies that can be incorporated into the curriculum.

## 4. Expected Deliverables

*   A `context/v2v/research` directory populated with raw research findings in markdown format.
*   A set of "synopsis artifacts" for each piece of research.
*   A final "meta-analysis" artifact that provides a blueprint for a new curriculum module.
