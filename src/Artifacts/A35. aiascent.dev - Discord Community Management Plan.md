## 1. Vision & Goal

The goal is to create a vibrant, supportive, and self-sustaining community hub on Discord for users of the Data Curation Environment (DCE). This community will serve as a place for learning, collaboration, and support, while also providing a pathway for monetization through high-value consulting and training, all managed through the DCE workflow itself.

## 2. Core Concept: The DCE-Powered Community

The community will be managed using the same principles the DCE promotes: "documentation first" and structured, iterative development. The community manager will act as a "Citizen Architect" for the community itself.

*   **Bot Integration:** A Discord bot will be set up. Its context will be the `aiascent-dev` website repository, allowing it to answer questions and generate community content with full project awareness.
*   **Artifact-Driven Management:** All significant community structures—rules, channel guides, role definitions, onboarding flows—will be created as documentation artifacts using the DCE. This ensures a "source of truth" for the community's governance.

## 3. Community Structure & Engagement

*   **Channel Setup:**
    *   `#welcome-and-rules`: Automated welcome message and clear community guidelines.
    *   `#announcements`: Project updates and news.
    *   `#dce-support`: For users seeking help with the DCE.
    *   `#showcase`: A place for users to share projects they've built with the DCE.
    *   `#vibecoding-lounge`: General chat and discussion about AI-assisted development.
    *   `#feature-requests`: For community feedback and ideas.
*   **Weekly "DCE in Action" Sessions:** The project curator will commit to weekly live sessions (e.g., via Discord stages or streaming) demonstrating how to use the DCE for various tasks. These sessions are free and serve as the top of the engagement funnel.

## 4. Monetization Model: The "Cognitive Apprenticeship" Funnel

The monetization strategy is based on offering progressively deeper levels of expert guidance.

*   **Tier 1: Free Community Access:**
    *   **Offering:** Access to all public channels, community support, and the weekly live sessions.
    *   **Goal:** Build a large, engaged user base and demonstrate the value of the DCE.

*   **Tier 2: Premium Support & Consulting:**
    *   **Offering:** For a fee, users can get dedicated, one-on-one consulting for their specific projects. This could be for troubleshooting, architectural guidance, or advanced workflow optimization.
    *   **Management:** This system can be managed within Discord. A bot could handle requests, payments (via Stripe integration), and scheduling. The community manager would be the primary point of contact, triaging requests and escalating complex issues to the curator.

*   **Role of the Community Manager:**
    *   Act as the first line of support, answering questions they can handle based on their knowledge.
    *   Triage questions they cannot answer and bring them to the curator.
    *   Manage the premium support system, acting as a liaison between users and the curator.
    *   Foster a positive and collaborative community environment.

This model creates a sustainable ecosystem where the community benefits from free resources and expert access, while providing a clear path to generate revenue by offering high-value, personalized expertise.
