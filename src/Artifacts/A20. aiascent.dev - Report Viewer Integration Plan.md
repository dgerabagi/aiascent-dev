## 1. Overview and Goal

The goal of this initiative is to integrate a feature-rich, interactive report viewer into the `aiascent.dev` website. This component, originally developed for the `aiascent.game` project, will be repurposed to display "The Ascent Report" on the `/showcase` page, a smaller whitepaper on the homepage, and future educational content on the `/learn` page. This plan outlines the technical strategy for porting, adapting, and integrating the component and its associated assets.

## 2. Technical Strategy

The porting process will involve migrating the React components, Zustand state management, and data/image assets into the `aiascent.dev` project structure.

### 2.1. Component and State Management Migration

*   **Components Directory:** A new directory will be created at `src/components/report-viewer/` to house all the ported React components (`.tsx` files) from `context/aiascentgame/report/`.
    *   The main component, `ReportViewerModal.tsx`, will be adapted to be a standard page component (`ReportViewer.tsx`) rather than a modal.
*   **State Management:** A new Zustand store will be created at `src/stores/reportStore.ts`. The code from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts` will be copied here. This store will manage the complex state of the report viewer, including page navigation, image selection, and chat functionality.
*   **Dependencies:** The `react-icons` library is a required dependency for the components and must be added to `package.json`.

### 2.2. Data and Asset Placement

To ensure the component can load its content, the following directory structure must be established by the curator.

*   **Report Data (JSON):**
    *   **Location:** `public/data/`
    *   **File:** The `reportContent.json` from the `aiascentgame` context will be copied to this directory and renamed to `ai_ascent_report.json`. This will be the primary data source for the `/showcase` page.
*   **Report Images:**
    *   **Location:** `public/assets/images/report/`
    *   **Structure:** The entire directory of images associated with the report must be copied here. The file paths within this directory must align with the URLs constructed by the logic in `reportStore.ts` (e.g., `/assets/images/report/report-3/...`).

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Phase 1: Scaffolding and File Placement (This Cycle)**
    *   Create the `src/components/report-viewer/` and `src/stores/` directories.
    *   Copy all relevant component and store files from the `context/` directory.
    *   Create the placeholder pages for `/showcase` and `/learn`.
    *   Instruct the curator to add dependencies and place the data/image assets in the `public/` directory.

2.  **Phase 2: Component Adaptation**
    *   Refactor `ReportViewerModal.tsx` into a standard `ReportViewer.tsx` component that can be embedded directly into a page.
    *   Update all import paths within the ported components to reflect the new project structure.
    *   Modify the data-loading logic in `reportStore.ts` to fetch from the new path (`/data/ai_ascent_report.json`).
    *   Adjust image URL construction logic if necessary to point to `/assets/images/report/...`.

3.  **Phase 3: Integration**
    *   Embed the fully adapted `ReportViewer.tsx` component into the `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`.
    *   Thoroughly test all functionality: page navigation, image cycling, and interactivity.

4.  **Phase 4: Reusability for Homepage and Learn Page**
    *   Refactor the `ReportViewer.tsx` and `reportStore.ts` to accept a `reportId` or data source URL as a prop. This will allow the same component to load different reports (e.g., the main report on `/showcase` vs. the whitepaper on the homepage). This is a future task.
