*   **Title:** Stages 1 & 2: The Annotator and The Toolmaker
*   **TL;DR:** The pathway begins by developing critical analysis (The Cognitive Annotator) and then shifts to active creation (The Adaptive Toolmaker), fostering agency and practical problem-solving.
*   **Content:**
    The journey starts not with coding, but with critical analysis. As a **Cognitive Annotator**, you learn to deconstruct problems and rigorously review AI output for correctness and security. The goal is to dismantle the flawed model of AI infallibility. Activities focus on decomposing problems into precise prompts and critically reviewing AI-generated code, identifying bugs, vulnerabilities, and stylistic inconsistencies. You learn to be skeptical of the AI. Here, the AI acts as a 'Scaffolded Solution Space,' providing complete examples for deconstruction.

    Next, as an **Adaptive Toolmaker**, you shift from consumer to creator. The goal is to solve authentic, contextual problems by building simple tools. You identify workflow inefficiencies and build 'on-the-fly' scripts, automations, and API integrations. This fosters agency and develops foundational skills in abstraction and systems thinking. In this stage, the AI acts as an 'Adaptive Component Library,' providing functions and code snippets for you to assemble into a coherent solution, forcing you to think about how the pieces fit together.
