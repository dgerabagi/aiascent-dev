## 1\. Purpose and Goal

The Learn page (planned for Phase 2, designed in C2) will be the central educational hub for aiascent.dev. Its goal is to onboard new users to the DCE extension and, more importantly, to teach the methodology and mindset of the "Citizen Architect." It aims to empower users to master AI-assisted development.

## 2\. Target Audience

Developers actively learning or using the DCE extension.

## 3\. Aesthetic and Tone

  * **Aesthetic:** Structured, clear, and easy to navigate. The design should prioritize readability and information hierarchy, similar to modern documentation sites (e.g., Next.js docs, Stripe docs).
  * **Tone:** Instructional, supportive, and practical.
