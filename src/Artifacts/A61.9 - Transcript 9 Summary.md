## 1. High-Level Summary

This transcript captures a coaching session where the curator is guiding learners through the process of setting up their project repositories and beginning to curate their initial data sets for the V2V workflow. The conversation is highly practical, focusing on file organization, the purpose of different document types, and the mechanics of using the Data Curation Environment (DCE) extension. The session emphasizes that a well-organized repository is the crucial first step in the "documentation first" methodology and serves as the foundation for all subsequent AI interactions.

## 2. Key Learnings & Insights

*   **Separation of Concerns in the Repo:** A key organizational principle is established:
    *   **Reference Documents:** Static, foundational materials that don't change often (e.g., frameworks, style guides, official documents).
    *   **Working/Project Documents:** The "living documents" and iterative artifacts that are created and modified during the development process.
    *   **Templates:** Reusable skeletons for projects, lessons, or artifacts.
*   **The Power of a Project Template:** The idea of a `project_template` folder is developed. This allows a user to bootstrap a new project with a pre-defined, logical folder structure, which is a key step toward a repeatable, "virtuoso" workflow.
*   **The Screenshot-to-Artifact Workflow:** A powerful technique is discussed: taking screenshots of a folder structure or UI, feeding them to an AI, and having the AI transcribe them into a structured text artifact (like a file tree list). This is presented as a method for quickly bootstrapping documentation.
*   **The Feedback Loop of Curation:** The process of organizing files is itself a learning experience. The curator explains that the user will naturally start grouping related files to make context selection easier (i.e., to minimize the number of checkboxes they need to click), leading to a more efficient structure over time.
*   **The DCE as a Data Management Tool:** The session provides a hands-on demonstration of the DCE's core features: selecting files with checkboxes, seeing the live token count update, sorting the selected file list by type or size, and removing unwanted files from the context.
*   **Handling Non-Text Files:** The session reveals a bug/limitation in the current version of the DCE: it cannot properly process `.docx` files, leading to garbled text in the flattened output. The immediate workaround is to convert them to PDFs, and the long-term solution is for the curator to add `.docx` parsing capability to the extension.

## 3. Best Bits (Direct Quotes)

*   **On the value of organization for AI:**
    > "As you're doing this, the file structure, what we'll do is we'll just click expand all when you're finally done and we'll take a screenshot of that. And then we'll just let AI turn that into an initial documentation artifact... And then... what you're gonna add in there is what is the significance of the folders, so that it is known from the get-go."

*   **On the iterative nature of the process:**
    > "You'll start making living documents that can turn into templates later because you've got... let's say you've already got templates for state A, listen, then we'll get a template at state Z."

*   **On troubleshooting and tool limitations:**
    > "Oh, I didn't handle docx yet. Sorry, dude. That's why it's happening, because I handled PDF, I handled XLS, I haven't handled docx yet... That'll be next, I guess, on the list. I'll do that for you tomorrow."
