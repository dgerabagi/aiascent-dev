## 1. Title: The Digital Wealth Fund: From Domain Rent to Sovereign Infrastructure

## 2. Problem Statement
Anguilla currently benefits from a significant windfall due to the sales of **.ai** domains. However, this revenue stream is essentially "rent"—it depends on the continued hype of AI and the policies of external registrars. Currently, Anguilla is a passive beneficiary of the AI boom. It does not own the *means of production* (compute, data centers, models) for the AI economy. If the domain market shifts or centralized AI powers consolidate, this revenue could vanish, leaving the island with no lasting digital assets.

## 3. Research Objectives
1.  **Analyze Domain Revenue Sustainability:** Project the long-term viability of .ai domain revenue and identify risks (e.g., new TLDs, market saturation).
2.  **Feasibility of Sovereign Compute:** Investigate the cost and logistics of building a "Sovereign AI Cloud" on the island—a local data center powered by renewable energy that hosts open-source models for local use.
3.  **Digital Wealth Fund Structure:** Research models for a Sovereign Wealth Fund specifically designed to reinvest digital rents into physical and digital infrastructure (e.g., Norway's oil fund model applied to digital assets).

## 4. Proposed Solution: The Anguilla Digital Infrastructure Initiative
We propose creating a **Digital Wealth Fund** funded by a percentage of .ai domain sales. This fund will invest exclusively in:
*   **Local Data Centers:** Building small-footprint, hurricane-resilient data centers to host local government and business data, ensuring data sovereignty.
*   **Subsea Connectivity:** Investing in fiber optic redundancy to ensure the island is never cut off.
*   **Sovereign Models:** Fine-tuning open-source models (like Llama 3 or Mistral) specifically on Anguillan law, history, and culture, creating a "National AI" that is owned by the people, not a foreign corporation.

## 5. Impact
*   **Economic Resilience:** Diversifies the economy beyond tourism and domain rent.
*   **Data Sovereignty:** Ensures that sensitive government and citizen data stays on the island, protected by local law.
*   **Global Prestige:** Positions Anguilla as a serious player in the digital infrastructure space, not just a lucky domain owner.
