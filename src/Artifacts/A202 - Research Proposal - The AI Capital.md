## 1. Title: The Digital Wealth Fund: From Domain Rent to Sovereign, Resilient Infrastructure

## 2. Problem Statement
Anguilla currently benefits from a significant windfall due to the sales of **.ai** domains. However, this revenue stream is essentially "rent"—it depends on the continued hype of AI and the policies of external registrars. Currently, Anguilla is a passive beneficiary of the AI boom. It does not own the *means of production* (compute, data centers, models) for the AI economy. Furthermore, standard digital infrastructure is vulnerable to the region's extreme weather events (hurricanes), posing a risk to any digital economy built upon it.

## 3. Research Objectives
1.  **Analyze Domain Revenue Sustainability:** Project the long-term viability of .ai domain revenue and identify risks (e.g., new TLDs, market saturation).
2.  **Feasibility of Resilient Sovereign Compute:** Investigate the cost and engineering requirements for building a "Sovereign AI Cloud" that is **hurricane-proof** (e.g., reinforced concrete bunkers, underground facilities) and **energy-independent** (solar/wind/battery).
3.  **Digital Wealth Fund Structure:** Research models for a Sovereign Wealth Fund specifically designed to reinvest digital rents into physical and digital infrastructure (e.g., Norway's oil fund model applied to digital assets).

## 4. Proposed Solution: The Anguilla Digital Infrastructure Initiative
We propose creating a **Digital Wealth Fund** funded by a percentage of .ai domain sales. This fund will invest exclusively in:
*   **Resilient Data Centers:** Building small-footprint, Category 5 hurricane-resilient data centers. These facilities will host local government and business data, ensuring data sovereignty even during disasters.
*   **Green Energy Integration:** Powering this infrastructure with renewable energy sources (solar farms, offshore wind) to ensure the AI economy does not burden the island's fossil fuel consumption or contribute to the climate crisis.
*   **Subsea Connectivity:** Investing in fiber optic redundancy to ensure the island is never cut off.
*   **Sovereign Models:** Fine-tuning open-source models (like Llama 3 or Mistral) specifically on Anguillan law, history, and culture, creating a "National AI" that is owned by the people, not a foreign corporation.

## 5. Impact
*   **Economic Resilience:** Diversifies the economy beyond tourism and domain rent.
*   **Data Sovereignty:** Ensures that sensitive government and citizen data stays on the island, protected by local law.
*   **Climate Adaptation:** Creates a robust digital backbone that can survive extreme weather events, ensuring communication and governance continue when they are needed most.
*   **Global Prestige:** Positions Anguilla as a serious player in the digital infrastructure space, leading the way in "Green AI."
