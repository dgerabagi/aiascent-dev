## 1. Title: The Global AI Sandbox: A Jurisdiction for Innovation

## 2. Problem Statement
The global regulatory landscape for AI is fragmented and uncertain. The EU is heavy on regulation (AI Act), while the US is fragmented. Innovative AI companies are looking for a jurisdiction that offers **regulatory clarity**, **speed**, and a **safe environment** to test advanced systems (like autonomous agents, drones, or fintech AI) before global deployment.

## 3. Research Objectives
1.  **Legal Framework Analysis:** Review current Anguillan laws regarding liability, data privacy, and intellectual property to identify gaps for AI regulation.
2.  **Competitive Analysis:** Analyze other "regulatory havens" (e.g., Estonia for e-Residency, Bermuda for insurance) to understand their success factors.
3.  **Risk Assessment:** Identify the risks of hosting experimental AI technologies and define the necessary "safety rails."

## 4. Proposed Solution: The Anguilla AI Sandbox
We propose establishing a legislative framework that designates Anguilla as a **"Special Economic Zone for AI."**
*   **Fast-Track Licensing:** A streamlined process for AI companies to legally register and operate.
*   **Liability Shields:** Clear laws defining liability for AI actions (essential for autonomous agents), providing certainty for developers.
*   **The "Proving Ground":** Designating specific physical or digital zones on the island for testing real-world AI applications (e.g., autonomous delivery drones, AI-managed microgrids) under government supervision.
*   **Data Trusts:** Creating a legal structure for "Data Trusts," allowing companies to securely share data for training models without losing ownership.

## 5. Impact
*   **Foreign Direct Investment:** Attracts high-growth AI startups and major tech companies to establish subsidiaries in Anguilla.
*   **Job Creation:** Creates demand for high-skill local jobs in compliance, legal, and technical support for these companies.
*   **Global Influence:** Anguilla punches above its weight, helping to set the standards for global AI regulation.
