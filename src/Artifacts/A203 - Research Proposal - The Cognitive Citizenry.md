## 1. Title: The Cognitive Citizenry: A National Upskilling and Cultural Preservation Strategy

## 2. Problem Statement
As AI automation advances, traditional service jobs are at risk. While upskilling is necessary, there is a risk that importing global AI curricula could erode local culture, replacing unique Anguillan identity with homogenized "silicon valley" values. Anguilla needs a strategy that modernizes the workforce *without* sacrificing its heritage.

## 3. Research Objectives
1.  **Skills Gap Analysis:** Assess the current digital literacy levels of the Anguillan workforce across key sectors.
2.  **Cultural Archive Feasibility:** Determine the state of Anguilla's oral histories, historical documents, and cultural artifacts. How much is digitized? How much is at risk of being lost?
3.  **Curriculum Adaptation:** Determine how to adapt the "Vibecoding to Virtuosity" (V2V) curriculum to be culturally relevant, using local metaphors and examples.

## 4. Proposed Solution: The National V2V Initiative
We propose a national program to provide every Anguillan citizen with:
*   **A Personal AI Companion:** A free, government-issued account on a national AI platform.
*   **The "Citizen Architect" Curriculum:** A modified version of the V2V Academy curriculum:
    *   *Module 1: AI for Small Business:* Tailored for local tourism and service businesses.
    *   *Module 2: AI for Education:* Providing AI tutors for every student.
    *   *Module 3: AI for Civics:* Using AI to engage with the government.
*   **The "Cultural Heritage AI" Project:** A national initiative to train a specific AI model on Anguillian history, dialect, folklore, and law.
    *   **Oral History Drives:** Citizens (especially elders) are interviewed, and their stories are transcribed to train the model.
    *   **Dialect Preservation:** The model is fine-tuned to understand and speak the local dialect, ensuring technology speaks the language of the people, not just standard English.

## 5. Impact
*   **Workforce Transformation:** Creates a globally competitive, AI-literate workforce.
*   **Cultural Renaissance:** Uses cutting-edge technology to preserve and celebrate Anguillan heritage, preventing cultural erasure.
*   **Intergenerational Connection:** Engages youth (technology) and elders (history) in a shared national project.
*   **Global Leadership:** Anguilla becomes the first nation with 100% AI literacy and a sovereign cultural AI model.
