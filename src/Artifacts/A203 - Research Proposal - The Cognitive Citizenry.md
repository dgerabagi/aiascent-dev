## 1. Title: The Cognitive Citizenry: A National Upskilling Strategy

## 2. Problem Statement
As AI automation advances, traditional service jobs (which dominate Anguilla's tourism-based economy) are at risk of disruption. Simultaneously, there is a massive global shortage of "AI-literate" workers—people who can effectively collaborate with AI to solve complex problems. Anguilla's population is small, which is usually a disadvantage, but in this context, it is an asset: it is small enough to be comprehensively upskilled.

## 3. Research Objectives
1.  **Skills Gap Analysis:** Assess the current digital literacy levels of the Anguillan workforce across key sectors (tourism, government, finance).
2.  **Curriculum Adaptation:** Determine how to adapt the "Vibecoding to Virtuosity" (V2V) curriculum for a general audience, moving from "developer-focused" to "citizen-focused."
3.  **Deployment Logistics:** Investigate the logistics of rolling out a "National AI Tutor" (an adapted version of Ascentia) to every citizen via mobile devices and community centers.

## 4. Proposed Solution: The National V2V Initiative
We propose a national program to provide every Anguillan citizen with:
*   **A Personal AI Companion:** A free, government-issued account on a national AI platform (powered by the Sovereign Cloud proposed in A202).
*   **The "Citizen Architect" Curriculum:** A modified version of the V2V Academy curriculum, translated into modules relevant to daily life and local business.
    *   *Module 1: AI for Small Business:* How to use AI to manage bookings, inventory, and marketing for tourism businesses.
    *   *Module 2: AI for Education:* Providing AI tutors for every student in the school system.
    *   *Module 3: AI for Civics:* How to use AI to understand laws, file taxes, and engage with the government.

## 5. Impact
*   **Workforce Transformation:** Creates a workforce that is uniquely attractive to global tech companies looking for remote talent.
*   **Economic Mobility:** Allows citizens to move from low-wage service roles to high-value knowledge work.
*   **Global Leadership:** Anguilla becomes the first nation with 100% AI literacy, a powerful brand for attracting investment.
