**Subject:** Inquiry from a Cybersecurity Practitioner re: Your Research in Cyber-Attack Detection

Dear Professor Etemadi,

I am a cybersecurity and applied AI practitioner writing to you today with great respect for your work. I have been following your group's research and was particularly struck by your involvement in the 2023 dissertation "Cyber Deception Techniques... for Cybersecurity Enhancement" and your more recent work on "feature selection for cyber attack detection."

My professional work is on the front-lines of this exact problem. I currently develop cybersecurity training for national security (NSA) clients and have an extensive background from Palo Alto Networks. In parallel, I do applied work on LLM alignment with Google's Gemini models. I am consistently finding that academic models for adversary detection could benefit immensely from the high-fidelity, real-world adversary TTP data I work with daily.

I see you are also the Assistant Director for Analytics for the AI/ML programs. This dual-role gives you a unique perspective on the intersection of academic AI research and its practical, industry-led application.

I recently received a rejection for my application to the Ph.D. in AI program, and while I respect the decision, I believe my unique, practitioner-focused profile may have been misaligned with a traditional academic review. I am reaching out to you for guidance. My passion is to build a formal research framework around my industry experience, and your work at the nexus of AI, cybersecurity, and infrastructure is the closest alignment I have found.

Would you be open to a brief, 15-minute virtual call in the coming weeks? I would be fascinated to learn more about your research and the industry-to-academia pipeline at GWU, and to demonstrate my own work on a novel HCI framework—the Data Curation Environment—that I believe has direct relevance to your field.

Respectfully,

David Gerabagi
