**Subject:** Inquiry from an AI Practitioner re: Your Research in Cyber-Attack Detection

Dear Professor Etemadi,

I am an applied AI practitioner writing to you today with great respect for your work. I have been following your group's research and was particularly struck by your involvement in the 2023 dissertation "Cyber Deception Techniques... for Cybersecurity Enhancement" and your more recent work on "feature selection for cyber attack detection."

My professional work is on the front-lines of this exact problem space. I develop cybersecurity training for national security clients and have an extensive background from Palo Alto Networks. In parallel, I do applied work on LLM alignment with Google's Gemini models. This dual focus has given me a unique perspective: while your research uses AI to *detect* problems, my work is focused on architecting new human-AI collaboration frameworks to build systems so advanced and resilient that many of today's attack vectors become obsolete. My ultimate goal is to help engineer a "Star Trek future" where we have elevated our collective cognitive capital to solve grander challenges than cybersecurity.

To this end, I created the **Data Curation Environment (DCE)**, a novel HCI framework that transforms AI collaboration into a structured engineering discipline. The project is open-sourced and live at **<https://aiascent.dev>**, and the methodology has already been validated by practitioners, including a colleague from the NSA's **Offensive Cyber Operations** who believes it would "immensely" improve their work.

I recently received a rejection for my application to the Ph.D. in AI program, and I believe my unique, practitioner-focused profile and this higher-level AI vision may have been misunderstood. I am reaching out to you not to appeal, but to ask for guidance. Your work at the nexus of AI and critical infrastructure security is the closest academic alignment I have found to my own passionate vision.

Would you be open to a brief, 15-minute virtual call in the coming weeks? I would be fascinated to learn more about your research and to demonstrate the DCE, which I believe has direct relevance to the future of building secure, AI-native systems.

Respectfully,

David Gerabagi
