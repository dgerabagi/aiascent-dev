**Subject:** Inquiry from an AI/Systems Practitioner (Palo Alto/NSA) Regarding D.Eng. in AI & Machine Learning

Dear Professor Mazzuchi,

I am writing to you in your capacity as both a Professor of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering and as the Co-Director of GW Engineering Online. I am an AI and systems practitioner, and my research into your work has revealed a powerful alignment that I hope you might provide some brief guidance on.

My professional experience is centered at the intersection of complex systems, AI, and cybersecurity risk. In my roles at Palo Alto Networks and developing training for the NSA, my work has been the practical application of the very topics I see in your recent research—from "Mitigating Cybersecurity Risks" to "Deep learning Architectures for Network Intrusion Detection."

This brings me to my query. I recently applied to the Ph.D. in AI program and was unsuccessful, though I was offered admission to the Ph.D. in Cybersecurity. I respectfully declined this offer because I believe focusing on cybersecurity alone addresses a symptom, not the root cause. My core passion and research interest lie in using AI to solve a higher-order problem: how do we fundamentally increase a society's "cognitive capital" to architect systems that are inherently more resilient and secure? My mission is to help build a "Star Trek future" of abundance, and I believe that starts by creating new paradigms for human-AI collaboration.

My work in creating the Data Curation Environment (DCE) is my first step in this direction. In retrospect, it is clear to me that my practitioner-focused profile was not the right fit for a traditional CS Ph.D. However, my research led me to the EMSE department's strategic focus on "trustworthiness in artificial intelligence" and, more specifically, to the **Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) in AI & Machine Learning** that you and Professor Sarkani oversee. This practice-oriented doctorate appears to be the "right fit" I was looking for.

I was deeply struck by your and Professor Sarkani's stated mission to provide a "level playing field" for driven professionals. I am not asking to appeal a past decision. I am asking for 15 minutes of your guidance, as the Co-Director of this program, on how a practitioner with a passionate, AI-driven vision for the future of systems engineering might find a home at GWU.

Thank you for your time and for your leadership in building programs for working professionals.

Respectfully,

David Gerabagi
