**Subject:** Inquiry from an AI/Cybersecurity Professional (Palo Alto/NSA) Regarding D.Eng. in AI & Machine Learning

Dear Professor Mazzuchi,

I am writing to you in your capacity as both a Professor of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering and as the Co-Director of GW Engineering Online. I am an AI and cybersecurity professional, and my research into your work has revealed a powerful alignment that I hope you might provide some brief guidance on.

My professional experience is centered at the intersection of complex systems, AI, and cybersecurity. In my roles at Palo Alto Networks and developing cybersecurity training for the NSA, my work has been the practical application of the very topics I see in your recent research—from "Mitigating Cybersecurity Risks in Grids" to "Deep learning Architectures for Network Intrusion Detection." As a professional who "trains" and productionalizes LLMs like Gemini, I was particularly drawn to your and Professor Sarkani's work on "MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WORKFORCE."

This brings me to my query. I am a driven practitioner, and I recently applied to and was rejected by the traditional Ph.D. in AI program in the Computer Science department. In retrospect, it is clear to me that my profile—which is focused on applied systems integration rather than foundational theory—was not the right fit for that program.

However, my subsequent research led me to the EMSE department's strategic focus on "trustworthiness in artificial intelligence" and, more specifically, to the **Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) in AI & Machine Learning** that you and Professor Sarkani oversee. This practice-oriented doctorate for working professionals appears to be the "right fit" I was looking for.

I was deeply struck by your and Professor Sarkani's stated mission to provide a "level playing field" for driven professionals to succeed. As someone who fits that profile, I am asking for 15 minutes of your guidance, as the Co-Director of this program, on how I might best prepare a future, successful application to the D.Eng. program—an environment where my practitioner background in AI and NSA-level cybersecurity risk would be an asset.

Thank you for your time and for your leadership in building programs for working professionals.

Respectfully,

David Gerabagi
