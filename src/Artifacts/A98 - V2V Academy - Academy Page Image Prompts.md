## 2. Image Prompts

### **2.1. Lab 1 Cover Image**

*   **Asset:** Main illustration for "Lab 1: Your First Project with the DCE."
*   **Prompt:** A hyper-realistic, cinematic image showing a first-time user's journey. The image is a split panel. On the left, a person sits before a completely blank computer screen, representing the "blank page problem." On the right, the same person is now confidently looking at a beautifully rendered, professional portfolio website they have just created. A glowing, translucent overlay of the DCE's spiral logo connects the two panels, symbolizing the tool that enabled the transformation. The aesthetic is hopeful, empowering, and solarpunk-inspired, with clean lighting and a modern, minimalist environment.

### **2.2. Persona Thumbnail Images**

*   **Asset:** Three separate thumbnail images for the persona selection cards. Each should be a powerful portrait of the "hero" of that journey.

    *   **Prompt 1 (The Career Transitioner):** A hyper-realistic, cinematic portrait of a seasoned professional (40s) standing in a sleek, architectural office. They are looking thoughtfully at a holographic blueprint of a complex system, a look of strategic insight on their face. The style is professional and sophisticated, adhering to the "Career Transitioner" aesthetic from `A75`.

    *   **Prompt 2 (The Underequipped Graduate):** A hyper-realistic, cinematic portrait of a recent graduate (20s) in a modern, collaborative tech office. They are looking up from their laptop with a confident, hopeful expression, a "lightbulb" moment of understanding visible. The background is slightly blurred, showing a positive, professional environment. The style aligns with the "Underequipped Graduate" aesthetic from `A75`.

    *   **Prompt 3 (The Young Precocious):** A hyper-realistic, cinematic portrait of a young, intense developer (late teens) in a high-tech, gaming-style setup with RGB lighting. They are focused on a screen displaying complex, glowing code, their hands poised over the keyboard as if about to execute a powerful command. The style is energetic and masterful, aligning with the "Young Precocious" aesthetic from `A75`.

### **2.3. Lab 1 Thumbnail Image**

*   **Asset:** Thumbnail image for the "Lab 1: Your First Portfolio" card.
*   **Prompt:** A clean, minimalist icon representing the creation of a portfolio. The icon shows a stylized browser window with a simple, elegant personal website inside it. A glowing `+` symbol and the DCE spiral logo are subtly overlaid in a corner, indicating that the website was created using the tool. The aesthetic is clean, modern, and instantly recognizable.

### **2.4. "Coming Soon" Course Thumbnail Image**

*   **Asset:** Thumbnail image for the "Course 1: The AI-Powered Report Viewer" card.
*   **Prompt:** A visually striking and futuristic icon representing the AI-Powered Report Viewer. The icon depicts a central, glowing document. From this document, several streams of light emerge, connecting to smaller icons representing its key features: a waveform (for TTS), a picture icon (for AI images), and a chat bubble (for the RAG chatbot). The entire composition is sleek, high-tech, and visually represents a keystone generative AI artifact.
