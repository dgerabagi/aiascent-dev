## 1. Overview and Goal

The primary goal of the "Vibecoding to Virtuosity" (V2V) Academy is to codify and teach the expert methodologies of its curator. The raw materials for this curriculum are a rich set of 1-on-1 coaching transcripts, existing project documentation, and the curator's demonstrated workflow. To transform this raw data into a structured and effective curriculum, a systematic process of analysis and synthesis is required.

This document outlines the formal plan for this process. It details a multi-phase approach to reverse-engineer the curator's tacit knowledge and explicit practices, aligning with the pedagogical model of Cognitive Apprenticeship, where an expert's internal thought processes are made visible and learnable.

## 2. Methodology: Reverse Engineering Expertise

The methodology is based on an observational investigation to distill a model of the expert's process. This involves analyzing the provided materials through several distinct "lenses" to extract different layers of knowledge.

### Phase 1: Thematic Analysis of Transcripts

This phase focuses on extracting the high-level, often philosophical, underpinnings of the curator's approach. The transcripts will be analyzed to identify recurring themes, core beliefs, and motivational drivers.

**Lenses for Analysis:**
*   **Core Principles:** What are the foundational beliefs about AI, learning, and development? (e.g., "AI is a feedback loop," "Data curation is the core skill").
*   **Mental Models & Analogies:** What metaphors and analogies are used to explain complex concepts? (e.g., "The internet is your hard drive," "The AI is your intern," "It's all just text").
*   **Strategic Vision:** What is the ultimate goal or motivation driving the work? (e.g., The "Star Trek" motivation, empowering "Citizen Architects").

**Output:** `A50 - V2V Academy - Core Principles & Philosophy.md`

### Phase 2: Workflow Deconstruction

This phase focuses on reverse-engineering the practical, step-by-step workflow the curator uses to move from an idea to an implemented solution. This involves analyzing not just the transcripts, but the entire project context (cycle history, artifacts, interaction schema).

**Lenses for Analysis:**
*   **Process Mapping:** What is the sequence of actions taken in a typical development cycle? (e.g., Start with documentation, generate multiple parallel responses, use Git to test and revert).
*   **Tool Usage:** What specific tools are used and how are they integrated? (e.g., The DCE extension, AI Studio, local LLMs, WinMerge).
*   **Heuristics & Rules of Thumb:** What are the recurring decision-making rules? (e.g., "Sort by token count," "Update documentation before code," "If a file is too big, refactor it").

**Output:** `A51 - V2V Academy - The Virtuoso's Workflow.md`

### Phase 3: Foundational Skills Identification

This phase works backward from the expert workflow to identify the true prerequisite skills, challenging traditional assumptions about what a developer needs to know.

**Lenses for Analysis:**
*   **Skill Dependency:** What foundational skills are absolutely necessary to execute the Virtuoso's workflow? (e.g., You can't critique an AI response without critical thinking skills).
*   **Omitted Skills:** What traditional skills are conspicuously absent or de-emphasized in the workflow? (e.g., The curator repeatedly states "I can't code," indicating that traditional programming syntax is not a primary prerequisite).
*   **Core Competencies:** Based on the above, what are the essential competencies? (e.g., Data Curation, Data Annotation, Critical Analysis, Systems Thinking).

**Output:** `A52 - V2V Academy - Foundational Skills Analysis.md`

## 3. Synthesis and Curriculum Design

Once the analysis is complete, the synthesized findings will be used to architect the curriculum itself, following a "backwards design" approach.

1.  **Define the End Goal:** The "Virtuoso's Workflow" (A51) becomes the aspirational target for the learner.
2.  **Structure the Pathway:** A curriculum outline will be created that deconstructs the Virtuoso's skills into a logical sequence of modules and lessons, starting with the end goal and working back to the fundamentals.
3.  **Develop Lesson Content:** The first lesson will be created, introducing the learner to the complete, end-to-end expert workflow as a "north star" for their learning journey.
