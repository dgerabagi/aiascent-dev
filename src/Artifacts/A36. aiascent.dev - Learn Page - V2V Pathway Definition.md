*   **Title:** The 'Vibecoding to Virtuosity' Pathway
*   **TL;DR:** The V2V pathway is a structured pedagogical model, grounded in Cognitive Apprenticeship, designed to transform intuitive AI interaction ('vibecoding') into architectural mastery.
*   **Content:**
    The creation of complex systems with AI is a journey. It begins with intuition and culminates in architectural mastery. This is the 'Vibecoding to Virtuosity' (V2V) pathway, a new model for creative development that redefines technical literacy. It is the curriculum for the Citizen Architect.

    'Vibecoding' is the intuitive, conversational starting point of AI collaboration, where a high-level goal or 'vibe' is translated into a functional artifact using natural language. It lowers the barrier to entry for creation to near zero. However, unstructured vibecoding can lead to fragile, insecure systems built by developers who don't fully understand their own creations.

    The V2V pathway addresses this by grounding the learning process in the established principles of Cognitive Apprenticeship. It provides a structured, four-stage developmental model designed to systematically guide a learner from a novice prompter to an expert architect, transforming intuitive interaction into deep, resilient mastery. This framework makes the "hidden curriculum" of expert thinking visible and learnable, ensuring that the speed of AI-assisted creation is matched by the rigor of true engineering.
