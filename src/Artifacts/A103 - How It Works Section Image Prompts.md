- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** Provides a set of new, detailed image prompts for the three core feature sections on the homepage (now the "How It Works" section), designed to align with the new "Citizen Architect" aesthetic.
- **Tags:** page design, home page, image prompts, marketing, content, aesthetic

## 1. Overview

This document provides the specific image generation prompts for the three feature sections on the homepage: "Precision Context Curation," "Parallel Co-Pilot & Rapid Testing," and "Iterative Knowledge Graph." These prompts are designed to be used with the master system prompt (`A15.1`) and the established "Citizen Architect" visual style to create a new, thematically coherent set of visuals that replace the previous simple icons.

### **Prompt 1: Precision Context Curation**

*   **Asset Name:** `curation.webp`
*   **Location:** `public/assets/images/how-it-works/`
*   **Prompt:** A hyper-realistic, cinematic image of a Citizen Architect interacting with a holographic file management interface. They are using simple checkboxes to select various file types (PDF, code, spreadsheets). A clean, precise beam of light, representing the curated context, flows from the selected files towards a destination labeled "Precision In, Perfection Out: The Art of Curation." The aesthetic is futuristic, clean, and aligned with the "Citizen Architect" style, featuring a dark background with vibrant blue and cyan accents.

### **Prompt 2: Parallel Co-Pilot & Rapid Testing**

*   **Asset Name:** `parallel-copilot.webp`
*   **Location:** `public/assets/images/how-it-works/`
*   **Prompt:** A hyper-realistic, cinematic image of a Citizen Architect standing before a large, futuristic touch-screen panel labeled "DCE's Parallel Co-Pilot Panel." The panel displays three different AI-generated solutions (A, B, C) side-by-side with an "Integrated Diff Viewer" highlighting the changes. The operator is comparing the solutions before committing, illustrating a "Rapid, Low-Risk Iteration Loop." The aesthetic is futuristic, clean, and aligned with the "Citizen Architect" style, emphasizing the speed and confidence of the workflow.

### **Prompt 3: Iterative Knowledge Graph**

*   **Asset Name:** `knowledge-graph.webp`
*   **Location:** `public/assets/images/how-it-works/`
*   **Prompt:** A hyper-realistic, cinematic image of a Citizen Architect standing in a vast, modern library-like space, representing "The Architecture of Institutional Memory." They are interacting with a "Cycle Navigator" to explore a massive, glowing "Persistent Knowledge Graph." Each node in the graph is a "CAPTURED CYCLE" containing the curated context, user intent, and AI solutions for a step in the project's history. The aesthetic is futuristic, clean, and aligned with the "Citizen Architect" style, conveying the scale and value of the captured knowledge.
