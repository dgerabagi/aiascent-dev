## 1. Vision & Goal

The "Citizen Architect" has emerged as the core brand identity for `aiascent.dev` and the V2V Academy. Recent image generation work has produced a consistent and compelling visual likeness for this archetype.

The goal of this initiative is to systematically re-brand the entire `aiascent.dev` website, replacing all existing imagery with new assets that align with this powerful, unified aesthetic. This will create a more professional, cohesive, and memorable brand identity.

## 2. The Phased Re-branding Roadmap

The re-branding will be executed in focused phases to ensure a manageable workflow.

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Homepage (Current Focus)**

*   **Objective:** To establish the foundational assets and re-brand the most prominent content on the site—the homepage's interactive whitepaper.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Develop New Master System Prompt (`A107`):** Create an updated image generation system prompt that codifies the "likeness and style transfer" workflow. This is a prerequisite for all subsequent image generation.
    2.  **Generate New Persona Likenesses (`A108`):** The current likenesses are for the "Young Precocious" persona. We must first generate the male and female "Citizen Architect" likeness cards for the "Career Transitioner" and "Underequipped Graduate" personas. This will give us a complete set of six archetypes to use.
    3.  **Re-brand Whitepaper Images (`A109`):** Create a new set of image prompts for all 19 pages of the "Process as Asset" whitepaper. These prompts will be designed to be combined with the new likenesses to generate the final, re-branded images.

### **Phase 2: Core Content Pages (Future Cycle)**

*   **Objective:** To re-brand the main informational pages of the website.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Generate new images for the "How It Works" section on the homepage. (Complete)
    2.  Generate new images for all sections on the `/mission` page.
    2.1. Before Generating new images, we should reconsider the language in the same vein as in the revamp of the homepage where we decided to not 'bury the lead' and to make the 'vibe code for free' one of the most prominent statements, as opposed to just hoping the users will derive this notion from the beautiful mess that is this website. 
    3.  Generate new images for all sections on the `/learn` page.

### **Phase 3: V2V Academy Curriculum (Future Cycle)**

*   **Objective:** To perform a complete visual overhaul of the entire V2V Academy interactive curriculum.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Re-generate all images for the "Career Transitioner" curriculum.
    2.  Re-generate all images for the "Underequipped Graduate" curriculum.
    3.  Re-generate all images for the "Young Precocious" curriculum (Complete).

## 3. Workflow for Image Generation

The workflow for this initiative, as defined by the curator, will be as follows:
1.  **Context Package:** The curator will provide the diffusion model with a package of images, typically including a base "likeness" image (e.g., the male Young Precocious) and an existing image from the website that needs to be re-branded.
2.  **System Prompt:** The new Master System Prompt (`A107`) will instruct the AI on how to perform the style transfer—taking the character likeness from the first image and applying it to the theme and composition of the second.
3.  **User Prompt:** A specific prompt (e.g., from `A109`) will guide the final composition.
