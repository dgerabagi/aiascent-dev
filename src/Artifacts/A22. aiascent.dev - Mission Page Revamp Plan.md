# Artifact A22: aiascent.dev - Mission Page Revamp Plan

# Date Created: C17

# Author: AI Model & Curator

- **Key/Value for A0:**
- **Description:** A plan to refactor the static Mission page into a smaller, digestible, static version of the interactive report viewer, showcasing key concepts with associated imagery.
- **Tags:** page design, mission, report viewer, refactor, plan, ui, ux

## 1. Overview and Goal

The current Mission page (`/mission`) serves its purpose as a static text document but lacks the engaging, interactive quality of the main Showcase. The goal of this refactor is to transform the Mission page into a "mini-report" that leverages the bite-sized, visually-driven format of the `ReportViewer`.

This will create a more thematically consistent and engaging experience for users, introducing them to the report viewer's UI concepts in a more digestible format before they dive into the full report on the Showcase page. This will be a static implementation, not a full port of the viewer, to keep the page lightweight.

## 2. Design and Component Structure

The page will be rebuilt as a series of content sections, each mimicking a "page" from the report viewer. Each section will contain:

1.  **Title:** The main heading for the concept.
2.  **Image Carousel:** A simple, auto-playing carousel of images relevant to the section's content.
3.  **Image Prompt:** The text of the prompt used to generate the images.
4.  **TL;DR:** A concise, one-sentence summary.
5.  **Content:** The full descriptive text for the section.

## 3. Content-to-Image Mapping

The following plan maps the existing narrative sections of the Mission page to specific images from the `imageManifest.json`. This provides a clear blueprint for the static page's content.

### **Section 1: The Vision**

*   **Title:** Empowering the Citizen Architect.
*   **TL;DR:** We are building the tools for a future where anyone with a vision can build complex systems.
*   **Images (from `group_the-citizen-architect-has-arrived_prompt-1`):**
    *   `the-citizen-architect-has-arrived-p1-img-1.webp`
    *   `the-citizen-architect-has-arrived-p1-img-5.webp`
    *   `the-citizen-architect-has-arrived-p1-img-9.webp`
*   **Image Prompt:** "A single individual is shown orchestrating a swarm of small, glowing AI bots to construct a complex and beautiful digital structure..."
*   **Content:** The existing text from the "The Vision" section.

### **Section 2: The Strategic Imperative**

*   **Title:** The Fissured Workplace
*   **TL;DR:** The current Western AI labor model is a strategic vulnerability, creating an unstable foundation for our most critical technology.
*   **Images (from `group_the-fissured-workplace_prompt-1`):**
    *   `the-fissured-workplace-p1-img-1.webp`
    *   `the-fissured-workplace-p1-img-7.webp`
    *   `the-fissured-workplace-p1-img-11.webp`
*   **Image Prompt:** "An architectural blueprint of a corporation. At the top is a solid, gleaming headquarters. Below it, the structure fractures into multiple, disconnected layers..."
*   **Content:** The existing text from "The Fissured Workplace" and "The Coherent Competitor" subsections.

### **Section 3: The Counter-Strategy**

*   **Title:** Our Strategy: Cognitive Apprenticeship
*   **TL;DR:** Our answer is not to imitate authoritarian control, but to unleash decentralized expertise through a model where AI serves as a tireless mentor.
*   **Images (from `group_the-pedagogical-engine-cam_prompt-1`):**
    *   `the-pedagogical-engine-cam-p1-img-1.webp`
    *   `the-pedagogical-engine-cam-p1-img-6.webp`
    *   `the-pedagogical-engine-cam-p1-img-12.webp`
*   **Image Prompt:** "A hyper-realistic, cinematic image illustrating 'Cognitive Apprenticeship'. An expert DCIA (human) is working alongside an apprentice. The expert's thought process is visualized as a glowing, structured blueprint ('The Hidden Curriculum') projected holographically above their head. The apprentice is observing and absorbing this blueprint. The setting is a bright, solarpunk training facility. The image captures the moment of insight as the invisible becomes visible. The message conveyed is \"The Hidden Curriculum Revealed\"."
*   **Content:** The existing text from the "Cognitive Apprenticeship" section.

### **Section 4: The Role of the DCE**

*   **Title:** The Essential Toolkit
*   **TL;DR:** The DCE is more than a productivity tool; it's the infrastructure for the Citizen Architect.
*   **Images (from `group_the-new-creative-partnership_prompt-1`):**
    *   `the-new-creative-partnership-p1-img-1.webp`
    *   `the-new-creative-partnership-p1-img-8.webp`
    *   `the-new-creative-partnership-p1-img-15.webp`
*   **Image Prompt:** "A hyper-realistic, solarpunk cinematic image of a developer... sitting cross-legged on a vast, glowing digital floor... thoughtfully placing one of these blocks into a complex, half-finished digital structure..."
*   **Content:** The existing text from "The Essential Toolkit" section.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Create Section Component:** Develop a new reusable React component, e.g., `MissionSectionBlock.tsx`, that accepts `title`, `tldr`, `content`, `images`, and `imagePrompt` as props.
2.  **Implement Carousel:** Inside this component, implement a simple image carousel (e.g., using `framer-motion` or a lightweight library) to display the provided images.
3.  **Refactor Mission Page:** Rebuild `src/app/mission/page.tsx` to be a container that renders a series of `<MissionSectionBlock />` components, passing in the data mapped out in this plan.
4.  **Styling:** Ensure the styling of the new components is consistent with the `ReportViewer` to create a cohesive user experience.
