## 1. Overview

This artifact contains the replacement content for the first page of the homepage's interactive whitepaper. The goal is to create a more welcoming and informative introduction, similar to the main Ascent Report, that introduces the AI assistant, explains the controls, and sets the stage for the whitepaper's topic.

## 2. New Page Content

*   **Page Title:** Welcome to the Interactive Whitepaper
*   **TL;DR:** An interactive guide to navigating this whitepaper and understanding its features, presented by your AI assistant, Ascentia.
*   **Content:**
    Hi there! I am Ascentia, your guide through this interactive experience. This whitepaper, "Process as Asset," explores the core philosophy behind the Data Curation Environment (DCE). It explains how a structured, iterative workflow can transform the very process of creation into a valuable, scalable asset.

    To help you navigate, allow me to explain the interface.

    *   To your left, you will find the **Report Navigator**, a tree that allows you to jump to any section.
    *   In the center are the primary controls. You can navigate between pages using the **up and down arrow keys**.
    *   For a more immersive experience, you can select **"Autoplay."** I will then read the contents of each page aloud to you.
    *   Finally, the **"Ask Ascentia"** button opens a direct line to me. This whitepaper is powered by a knowledge base built from all the documentation for the DCE project. If you have any questions about how the DCE works, feel free to ask.

    Enjoy the exploration.
