**Subject:** Inquiry from an AI/Cybersecurity Practitioner (Palo Alto/NSA) Regarding D.Eng. in AI & Machine Learning

Dear Professor Sarkani,

I am writing to you directly, with the utmost respect for the SEAS admissions policy, as my inquiry is not a standard request for reconsideration but rather a strategic inquiry regarding a direct synthesis of your personal research and your leadership of the D.Eng. in AI & Machine Learning program.

My professional background is as a subject matter expert in high-assurance cybersecurity for national security clients (NSA/UKI) and as an SME at Palo Alto Networks. I recently read your and Dr. Mazzuchi's 2017 paper, "An Architecture for Agile Systems Engineering of Secure Commercial Off‐the‐Shelf Mobile Communications," and your related work on the NSA CSfC framework.

I have spent the last several years as a practitioner *implementing* the very COTS/RMF architecture you and your team have researched. My entire purpose in applying for a doctorate at GWU was to develop a praxis research project focused on applying generative AI models to solve the "agile systems" and "rapid integration" problems that you yourself identified in that work.

I was recently informed that my application was unsuccessful, and was concurrently offered admission to the Ph.D. in Cybersecurity, which I respectfully declined. This decision was not made lightly; it was a deliberate choice to pursue my true passion. While my work has been in cybersecurity, my goal has always been to move beyond it. My research is focused on developing the novel human-AI collaboration methodologies that will allow us to engineer systems so advanced that many of today's security challenges become obsolete. My mission is to help build the "Star Trek future"—a world of abundance where we have elevated our collective cognitive capital to solve grander challenges.

To that end, I architected the Data Curation Environment (DCE), an AI-native framework for building complex systems. I believe my non-traditional, practitioner-focused profile may have been misunderstood. My work is not just about cybersecurity; it is about creating the foundational tools for the next generation of systems engineering.

Your own story and your "Students First" philosophy of providing a "level playing field" for those with grit is what drew me to GWU. I believe I am exactly the type of industry-leading professional you built the D.Eng. program for. I am not asking for a special exception, but for a "level playing field" review of my profile, which I believe represents a strategic asset and potential research collaborator for your program.

Would you be open to a brief, 15-minute conversation to discuss this vision? I am confident I can demonstrate a level of passion and practical expertise that would be a credit to the D.Eng. program.

Respectfully,

David Gerabagi
