**Subject:** Inquiry from an AI/Cybersecurity Practitioner (Palo Alto/NSA) Regarding D.Eng. in AI & Machine Learning

Dear Professor Sarkani,

I am writing to you directly, with the utmost respect for the SEAS admissions policy, as my inquiry is not a standard request for reconsideration but a strategic inquiry regarding a direct synthesis of your personal research and your leadership of the D.Eng. in AI & Machine Learning program.

My professional background is as a subject matter expert in high-assurance cybersecurity for national security clients (NSA/UKI) and as an SME at Palo Alto Networks. I recently read your and Dr. Mazzuchi's 2017 paper, "An Architecture for Agile Systems Engineering of Secure Commercial Off‐the‐Shelf Mobile Communications," and your related work on the NSA CSfC framework.

I have spent the last several years as a practitioner implementing the very COTS/RMF architecture you and your team have researched. My entire purpose in applying for a doctorate at GWU was to develop a praxis research project focused on applying generative AI models to solve the "agile systems" and "rapid integration" problems that you yourself identified in that work.

I was recently informed that my application for the Ph.D. in AI was unsuccessful. I can only surmise that my non-traditional, practitioner-focused profile was misunderstood by a standard academic rubric. My "training" role, for example, is as a Subject Matter Expert in COTS architecture, and my "coding" experience is in applied generative AI model optimization and the creation of novel HCI frameworks like my Data Curation Environment.

Your own story and your "Students First" philosophy of providing a "level playing field" for those with grit is what drew me to GWU. I believe I am exactly the type of industry-leading professional you built the D.Eng. program for. I am not asking for a special exception, but for a "level playing field" review of my profile, which I believe represents a strategic asset and potential research collaborator for your program.

Would you be open to a brief, 15-minute conversation to discuss the alignment between my work and your research? I am confident I can demonstrate a level of passion, drive, and practical expertise that would be a credit to the D.Eng. program.

Respectfully,

David Gerabagi
