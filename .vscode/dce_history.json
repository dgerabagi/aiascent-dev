I understand the plan to create a new website for DCE at `aiascent.dev`, repurposing existing assets to build a homepage and an interactive whitepaper. My course of action is to answer your technical hosting questions, provide the initial planning and documentation artifacts to \"pre-boot\" this new website project, and give you a clear list of which existing DCE artifacts you should copy over for context.\n\nI will begin by creating a new artifact that provides a comprehensive plan for hosting both `aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev` on your single server using Caddy, which is the best-practice solution for your setup. Then, I will generate the initial set of planning documents for the new website project itself, including a project vision, technical plan, and a specific plan for the interactive whitepaper. Finally, I will provide a clear, actionable list of the existing DCE artifacts you should port over.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Answer Hosting Questions:** I will create a new artifact, **`A113. aiascent.dev - Multi-Domain Hosting Plan.md`**, to provide a definitive answer to your questions. It will explain that you can point both domains' DNS records to your single IP and use a reverse proxy like Caddy to route traffic based on the domain name requested. I will provide a sample `Caddyfile` configuration.\n2.  **Pre-boot `aiascent-dev` Project:** I will generate the initial set of documentation artifacts required to start the new website project using the DCE workflow.\n    *   Create **`A114. aiascent.dev - Project Vision and Goals.md`** to define the scope and purpose of the new website.\n    *   Create **`A115. aiascent.dev - Technical Scaffolding Plan.md`** to propose a technical stack (Next.js, React, TypeScript) suitable for building the homepage and interactive report viewer.\n    *   Create **`A116. aiascent.dev - Interactive Whitepaper Plan.md`** to detail the requirements and implementation strategy for adapting the report viewer from `aiascent.game`.\n    *   Create **`A117. aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List.md`** to serve as the `A0` file for this new project, cataloging all the newly created planning documents.\n3.  **Provide Porting Instructions:** I will include a `<curator_activity>` section with a checklist of the essential documentation artifacts from the *current* DCE extension project that you should copy into your new `C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev\\context\\dce` directory to provide context for that new development effort.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A113. aiascent.dev - Multi-Domain Hosting Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A113: aiascent.dev - Multi-Domain Hosting Plan\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A technical guide explaining how to host multiple domains (aiascent.game and aiascent.dev) on a single server with one public IP address using a Caddy reverse proxy.\n- **Tags:** hosting, networking, dns, caddy, reverse proxy, multi-domain\n\n## 1. Overview & Goal\n\nThis document provides the technical solution for hosting both `aiascent.game` and the new `aiascent.dev` website on the same home server that is also running the vLLM instance. The goal is to configure the network and server to correctly route incoming traffic to the appropriate application based on the requested domain name.\n\nThe recommended and most robust solution is to use a reverse proxy, and since you are already using Caddy, we will expand that configuration.\n\n## 2. The Architecture\n\nThe setup involves three main parts: DNS, Port Forwarding, and the Caddy Reverse Proxy.\n\n```\n+----------------+      +----------------+      +-----------------+      +---------------------+\n|   DNS Records  |      |   AT&T Router  |      |  Caddy Server   |----->| aiascent.game (App) |\n| aiascent.game  |----->|                |      | (Reverse Proxy) |      | (localhost:3001)    |\n| aiascent.dev   |      | (Public IP)    |----->|                 |      +---------------------+\n+----------------+      |                |      |                 |\n                        | (Ports 80/443) |      |                 |      +---------------------+\n                        +----------------+      +-----------------+----->| aiascent.dev (App)  |\n                                                                         | (localhost:3002)    |\n                                                                         +---------------------+\n```\n\n## 3. Step-by-Step Configuration\n\n### Step 1: DNS Configuration\nYou are correct in your thinking. You need to configure the DNS \"A\" records for both of your domains to point to the same public IP address provided by your AT&T router.\n\n-   **`aiascent.game` -> A Record -> `[Your Public IP]`**\n-   **`aiascent.dev` -> A Record -> `[Your Public IP]`**\n\n### Step 2: Port Forwarding (AT&T Router)\nYour router is already configured to forward traffic for `aiascent.game`, but you should ensure it forwards all standard web traffic to your server's *local* IP address.\n\n-   Forward incoming TCP traffic on port **80** to your server's local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).\n-   Forward incoming TCP traffic on port **443** to your server's local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).\n\nCaddy will handle receiving traffic on these ports.\n\n### Step 3: Caddy Reverse Proxy Configuration (Caddyfile)\nThis is the core of the solution. Caddy will inspect the `Host` header of each incoming request and route it to the correct backend application running on a different internal port. This allows you to run multiple web services on the same machine.\n\nBelow is a sample `Caddyfile` that handles both domains. You will run your `aiascent.game` server on port `3001` and your new `aiascent.dev` website server on a different port, like `3002`.\n\n```caddy\n# Caddyfile for Multi-Domain Hosting\n\n{\n    # Global options, like your email for Let's Encrypt SSL certificates\n    email your-email@example.com\n}\n\n# Site 1: AI Ascent Game\naiascent.game, www.aiascent.game {\n    # Caddy automatically handles HTTPS for this domain.\n    \n    # Reverse proxy all requests for aiascent.game to your game server\n    # running on localhost port 3001.\n    reverse_proxy localhost:3001\n}\n\n# Site 2: New DCE Website\naiascent.dev, www.aiascent.dev {\n    # Caddy automatically handles HTTPS for this domain as well.\n    \n    # Reverse proxy all requests for aiascent.dev to your new website server\n    # running on localhost port 3002.\n    reverse_proxy localhost:3002\n}\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n1.  A user requests `https://aiascent.dev`.\n2.  DNS resolves it to your public IP.\n3.  Your router forwards the request on port 443 to your server.\n4.  Caddy receives the request. It sees the request is for `aiascent.dev`.\n5.  It looks at the `aiascent.dev` block in the `Caddyfile` and proxies the request to the application running on `localhost:3002`.\n\nThis setup is clean, secure (with automatic HTTPS), and easily scalable if you decide to add more domains in the future.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A114. aiascent.dev - Project Vision and Goals.md\">\n# Artifact A114: aiascent.dev - Project Vision and Goals\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** High-level overview of the aiascent.dev website, its purpose as a promotional hub for DCE, and its development plan.\n- **Tags:** project vision, goals, scope, aiascent.dev, dce, website\n\n## 1. Project Vision\n\nThe vision for the `aiascent.dev` website is to create a professional, public-facing hub for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) project. It will serve as the primary destination for developers to learn about the DCE, understand its value proposition, and access resources like tutorials and the project's whitepaper.\n\nCrucially, the website itself will be a **living demonstration of the DCE's power**. It will be built from the ground up using the DCE workflow, serving as a tangible showcase of what can be achieved with this new paradigm of AI-assisted development.\n\n## 2. High-Level Goals & Phases\n\nThe project will be developed in distinct phases.\n\n### Phase 1: Homepage & Core Content\n\nThe goal of this phase is to establish the foundational website with a compelling homepage that introduces the DCE.\n\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Develop a modern, responsive single-page homepage by adapting the shell of the `automationsaas` project.\n    -   Clearly articulate the problem DCE solves (the friction in AI context management) and its solution.\n    -   Include sections for \"Features,\" \"Workflow,\" and a \"Get Started\" call-to-action that links to the future VS Code Marketplace page.\n-   **Outcome:** A functional, visually appealing landing page that effectively promotes the DCE extension.\n\n### Phase 2: The Interactive Whitepaper\n\nThis phase focuses on building a unique and engaging way to present the project's whitepaper, further demonstrating the capabilities of DCE.\n\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Create a new section/tab on the website for an \"Interactive Whitepaper.\"\n    -   This feature will be a professionalized clone of the \"Report Viewer\" from the `aiascent.game` project.\n    -   It will present the content of the DCE whitepaper (`A78`) in an engaging, multi-modal format with text, images, and potentially narration.\n-   **Outcome:** A powerful showcase piece that not only communicates the project's strategic vision but also serves as a second example of a complex web tool built using the DCE.\n\n### Phase 3: Community & Resources\n\nThis phase will expand the site to include resources for a growing user community.\n\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Add a \"Tutorials\" section, using the report viewer infrastructure to host interactive guides on \"vibe coding\" and using the DCE effectively.\n    -   Add a \"Blog\" or \"Updates\" section to communicate project progress.\n-   **Outcome:** The `aiascent.dev` site becomes the central community and learning hub for the DCE project.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A115. aiascent.dev - Technical Scaffolding Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A115: aiascent.dev - Technical Scaffolding Plan\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** Outlines the proposed technical scaffolding and file structure for the aiascent.dev website, leveraging a modern React-based framework.\n- **Tags:** technical plan, scaffolding, file structure, typescript, nextjs, react\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis document outlines the proposed technical scaffolding and file structure for the `aiascent.dev` website. The plan is to use a modern, performant, and developer-friendly technology stack that aligns well with the existing assets (`automationsaas` shell, `aiascent.game` report viewer) which are built with React.\n\n## 2. Technology Stack\n\n-   **Language:** TypeScript\n-   **Framework:** Next.js (or a similar React framework like Vite + React)\n    -   **Rationale:** Next.js provides an excellent developer experience, server-side rendering (SSR) for fast initial page loads and good SEO, static site generation (SSG) for performance, and a robust routing system. This is a perfect fit for a content-focused promotional site and a complex interactive application like the report viewer.\n-   **Styling:** SCSS or TailwindCSS (To be determined by the `automationsaas` project's existing styles).\n-   **Deployment:** The application will be built as a static or Node.js-based site, to be served locally via the Caddy reverse proxy as detailed in `A113`.\n\n## 3. Proposed File Structure (Next.js App Router)\n\nThe project will adhere to the modern Next.js App Router structure, which is feature-driven and colocates components with the pages that use them.\n\n```\naiascent-dev/\n├── src/\n│   ├── app/\n│   │   ├── (main)/\n│   │   │   ├── page.tsx            # The main homepage component\n│   │   │   └── layout.tsx          # Root layout with header/footer\n│   │   │\n│   │   ├── whitepaper/\n│   │   │   ├── page.tsx            # The interactive whitepaper/report viewer page\n│   │   │   └── layout.tsx          # Layout specific to the whitepaper section\n│   │   │\n│   │   ├── globals.css             # Global styles\n│   │   └── layout.tsx              # Root layout\n│   │\n│   ├── components/                 # Shared, reusable UI components\n│   │   ├── Header.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   └── ReportViewer/           # The adapted report viewer component\n│   │       ├── ReportViewer.tsx\n│   │       └── ... (other sub-components)\n│   │\n│   ├── lib/                        # Utility functions, constants\n│   │\n│   └── context/                    # Folder for DCE context artifacts\n│       ├── aiascentgame/\n│       ├── automationsaas/\n│       └── dce/\n│\n├── public/                         # Static assets (images, fonts)\n│\n├── package.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n└── next.config.js\n```\n\n## 4. Key Architectural Concepts\n\n-   **Component-Based UI:** The UI will be built by composing small, reusable React components.\n-   **Server Components:** Leverage Next.js Server Components for performance, fetching data on the server where possible.\n-   **Separation of Concerns:** The structure separates pages, shared components, and utility logic.\n-   **DCE-Driven Development:** The entire project will be developed using the DCE extension, with all planning and documentation residing in a `src/Artifacts` directory (to be created in Cycle 1 of that project).\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A116. aiascent.dev - Interactive Whitepaper Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A116: aiascent.dev - Interactive Whitepaper Plan\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** Details the plan to adapt the existing \"Report Viewer\" from aiascent.game into a professional, interactive whitepaper for the DCE project.\n- **Tags:** feature plan, whitepaper, report viewer, showcase, aiascent.dev\n\n## 1. Overview & Goal\n\nA key feature of the `aiascent.dev` website is the \"Interactive Whitepaper.\" This will serve as a compelling and innovative way to present the strategic vision behind the Data Curation Environment (DCE). The goal is to create this feature by adapting the existing \"Report Viewer\" component from the `aiascent.game` project, professionalizing its appearance and loading it with the content from the DCE whitepaper (`A78`).\n\nThis effort serves a dual purpose: it creates a great user experience for reading the whitepaper and acts as a powerful demonstration of reusing complex components built with the DCE workflow.\n\n## 2. User Stories\n\n| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |\n|---|---|---|\n| WP-01 | **Navigate Whitepaper** | As a visitor, I want to navigate the sections and pages of the whitepaper using a tree-like table of contents, so I can easily find the information I'm interested in. | - A side panel displays a hierarchical view of the whitepaper's sections and pages. <br> - Clicking an item in the navigator instantly loads and displays the content for that page. |\n| WP-02 | **View Multimodal Content** | As a visitor, I want to view the whitepaper content, which includes formatted text and associated images, so I can have a rich reading experience. | - The main content area displays the text for the selected page. <br> - An image viewer displays the images associated with that page. |\n| WP-03 | **Professional UI/UX** | As a visitor, I expect the interactive whitepaper to have a clean, professional, and modern design that is distinct from the in-game theme of `aiascent.game`. | - The UI is restyled with a new color palette, typography, and layout suitable for a professional project website. <br> - All game-specific elements (e.g., sci-fi borders, thematic icons) are removed or replaced. |\n\n## 3. Technical Implementation Plan\n\n1.  **Code Porting:**\n    *   The curator will copy the relevant React components for the \"Report Viewer\" from the `aiascent.game` project into the `aiascent-dev` project's `src/components/ReportViewer/` directory.\n    *   The curator will also copy the `reportContent.json` file (which contains the whitepaper text) into the `aiascent-dev` project, likely under `src/lib/data/`.\n\n2.  **Component Adaptation:**\n    *   The main `ReportViewer.tsx` component will be refactored to be a self-contained, reusable component.\n    *   It will be updated to load its content from a local JSON file instead of fetching from a game server API.\n    *   Props will be added to allow for customization of its appearance (e.g., theme, colors).\n\n3.  **Styling (`.scss` or Tailwind):**\n    *   A new stylesheet will be created specifically for the `ReportViewer` component.\n    *   All existing styles will be reviewed and overridden to match the professional aesthetic of the `aiascent.dev` website. This will be the most significant part of the work.\n\n4.  **Integration:**\n    *   The `src/app/whitepaper/page.tsx` file will import and render the newly adapted `ReportViewer` component, passing in the required data.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A117. aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List.md\">\n# Artifact A117: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The definitive list of all documentation artifacts for the aiascent.dev website project.\n- **Tags:** documentation, master artifact list, project setup, aiascent.dev\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nThis is an excellent and comprehensive plan. Your strategy to create a promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) on `aiascent.dev` is sound, and your technical approach for hosting and development is perfectly aligned with modern web practices.\n\nMy course of action is to fully support this new initiative. First, I will confirm the technical details of your hosting plan. Second, I will provide a curated list of essential artifacts from the current DCE project that you should port over to provide context for the new `aiascent-dev` project. Finally, I will \"pre-boot\" the new project by generating a complete starter set of Cycle 0 documentation artifacts, tailored to the goal of building the new promotional website and interactive whitepaper.\n\n</summary>\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Confirm Hosting Strategy:** I will confirm that your plan to point both `aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev` to the same IP address and use your `server.ts` to route traffic based on the request's hostname is a standard and effective method for hosting multiple domains on a single server. This is often referred to as using virtual hosts or server blocks.\n\n2.  **Provide Curated Artifact List:** I will provide a list of key documentation artifacts from the DCE project that are essential for bootstrapping the `aiascent-dev` website. This will ensure the new project has the necessary context regarding the DCE's vision, workflow, and technical architecture.\n\n3.  **Generate Initial Artifacts for `aiascent-dev-website`:** I will generate a complete set of \"Cycle 0\" planning documents for the new project.

Confirming Your Hosting Strategy\n\nYour plan is technically sound and is a common practice for hosting multiple websites on a single server/IP address. Here is the confirmation of the workflow:\n\n1.  **DNS Configuration:** Point the `A` records for both `aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev` to the public IP address of your home server.\n2.  **Server-Side Routing:** In your `server.ts` (or within a reverse proxy like Caddy/Nginx), you will inspect the `Host` header of incoming HTTP requests. Based on whether the host is `aiascent.game` or `aiascent.dev`, you can then route the request to the appropriate application logic (e.g., to the game server or the new DCE website server). For a Next.js application, this can be handled using middleware or API routes to check the request headers.\n\nThis setup will work perfectly for your intended purpose.\n\n### 2. Recommended DCE Artifacts to Port\n\nTo provide the necessary context for the new `aiascent-dev` project, I recommend you copy the following artifacts from this DCE project into your `C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev\\context\\dce` directory.

Key Implementation Steps\n\n1.  **Project Initialization:**\n    *   Initialize a new Next.js project in `C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`.\n    *   Set up the basic file structure as outlined above.\n\n2.  **Component Migration:**\n    *   **Homepage:** Copy the relevant layout and component files from the `automationsaas` project to serve as the shell for `src/app/page.tsx`.\n    *   **Report Viewer:** Copy the `report viewer` component and all its dependencies (child components, state management, utility functions) from the `aiascent.game` project into `src/components/report-viewer/`. This is a straightforward file copy-paste operation.\n    *   **Data:** Copy the `reportContent.json` file into the project, likely in a `/data` or `/lib` directory, so it can be imported and passed to the report viewer component.\n\n3.  **Integration and Styling:**\n    *   Integrate the cloned `ReportViewer` component into the `src/app/whitepaper/page.tsx` page.\n    *   Refactor the component's styling to match the professional aesthetic of the new `aiascent.dev` site, removing any game-specific branding.\n    *   Update the homepage content to be relevant to the DCE extension.\n\n4.  **Server Configuration:**\n    *   Update the main `server.ts` on the host machine to include logic for routing requests for `aiascent.dev` to the new Next.js application's build output.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-website-A7-Development-and-Testing-Guide.md\">\n# Artifact A7: aiascent-dev-website - Development and Testing Guide\n# Date Created: C0\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A step-by-step guide explaining how to run, debug, and test the website locally.\n- **Tags:** development, testing, debugging, workflow\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **AI Ascent Dev Website** application locally.\n\n## 2. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed using npm.\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code and watch for changes, run the following command:```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\nThis will start the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOpen a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the homepage of the website. The development server supports hot-reloading, so any changes you save in the source code will be reflected in the browser automatically.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\nYou can use your browser's developer tools to debug the frontend application. You can set breakpoints, inspect the DOM, and view console logs directly in the browser. For backend debugging of any server-side rendering logic or API routes, you can use the VS Code debugger attached to the Node.js process.\n\n## 3. Testing\n\nThe project will be configured with a testing framework (e.g., Jest with React Testing Library). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-website-A9-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\">\n# Artifact A9: aiascent-dev-website - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n# Date Created: C0\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A guide with the necessary git commands to initialize the project as a local repository and push it to a new remote repository on GitHub.\n- **Tags:** git, github, version control, setup\n\n## 1.

Prerequisites\n\n*   You have `git` installed on your machine.\n*   You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev-website`\n4.  **Description:** Promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions. We will use the section titled **\"...or push an existing repository from the command line\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory (`C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`). Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files:**\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"Initial commit: Cycle 0 planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev-website.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\nAfter these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files. You are now set up to use the DCE and Git to build this new website.\n</file>"

          "content": "<summary>\nThis is an excellent and comprehensive plan. I can confirm that your proposed hosting setup is entirely feasible and a standard industry practice. You can indeed host multiple domains (`aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev`) on a single server with one IP address. The routing is handled by a reverse proxy like Caddy, which inspects the incoming request's `Host` header (`aiascent.game` or `aiascent.dev`) and forwards the traffic to the appropriate backend service or route within your Node.js `server.ts` application. Your existing Caddy setup is well-suited for this.\n\nMy course of action is to execute your plan by providing the two key deliverables you've requested. First, I will create a new planning artifact for the `aiascent-dev` project that includes a curated list of the most relevant DCE artifacts you should port over.

It aims to provide a professional, informative website that will serve as the primary destination for users to learn about, download, and get support for the DCE. The site itself will be a testament to the power of the DCE, as it will be built using the very same artifact-driven, AI-assisted workflow it promotes.\n\n## 2. High-Level Goals & Phases\n\nThe project will be developed in distinct phases to ensure an iterative and manageable workflow.\n\n### Phase 1: Core Website and Interactive Whitepaper\n\nThe goal of this phase is to establish the foundational elements of the project, leveraging existing assets for rapid development.\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Develop a main homepage based on the `automationsaas` project shell, explaining the DCE's value proposition.\n    -   Create an \"Interactive Whitepaper\" section by adapting the report viewer from `aiascent.game`.\n    -   Host the \"Process as Asset\" whitepaper as the initial content for the viewer.\n-   **Outcome:** A live, functional website at `aiascent.dev` that introduces the DCE to the world and showcases a key component built with the DCE methodology.\n\n### Phase 2: Tutorial and \"Vibe Coding\" Hub\n\nThis phase will build upon the foundation of Phase 1 by adding educational content.\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Expand the report viewer to support multiple documents.\n    -   Create and host a series of tutorials on how to \"vibe code\" and use the DCE effectively.\n    -   Add a blog or articles section for development updates and thoughts on AI-assisted workflows.\n-   **Outcome:** `aiascent.dev` becomes a central resource for learning the \"AI Ascent\" development methodology.\n\n### Phase 3: Community and Integration\n\nThis phase focuses on building a community around the DCE and integrating with other platforms.\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Add links to the official VS Code Marketplace page.\n    -   Integrate with GitHub for issue tracking and community contributions.\n    -   Potentially add a forum or Discord integration for user support.\n-   **Outcome:** A polished and comprehensive hub for the entire DCE project and its user community.\n</file>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-A3-Technical-Scaffolding-Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A3: aiascent-dev - Technical Scaffolding Plan\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A generic template for a technical scaffolding plan.\n- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis document outlines the proposed technical scaffolding and file structure for **aiascent.dev**. This plan serves as a blueprint for the initial project setup, ensuring a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture from the start, leveraging modern web development practices.\n\n## 2. Technology Stack\n\n-   **Language:** TypeScript\n-   **Framework/Library:** React with Next.js (This is recommended for its performance, SEO benefits, and ease of routing, which will be useful for the different sections like the whitepaper).\n-   **Styling:** SCSS or TailwindCSS (To be determined based on the styles of the imported `automationsaas` and `report viewer` components).\n-   **Bundler:** Webpack (Handled automatically by Next.js).\n\n## 3. Proposed File Structure\n\nThe project will adhere to a standard Next.js directory structure:\n\n```\n.\n├── src/\n│   ├── app/                # Next.js App Router for pages and layouts\n│   │   ├── (main)/           # Main website routes\n│   │   │   ├── page.tsx      # Homepage\n│   │   │   └── layout.tsx\n│   │   ├── whitepaper/       # Route group for the interactive whitepaper\n│   │   │   ├── page.tsx\n│   │   │   └── layout.tsx\n│   │   └── global.scss     # Global styles\n│   │\n│   ├── components/         # Reusable React components (e.g., Navbar, Footer)\n│   │   └── report-viewer/  # The adapted report viewer component\n│   │\n│   ├── lib/                # Utility functions, helpers\n│   │\n│   └── content/            # Static content, like the markdown/json for the whitepaper\n│\n├── public/                 # Static assets (images, fonts)\n│\n├── package.json            # Project manifest and dependencies\n└── tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration\n```\n\n## 4. Key Architectural Concepts\n\n-   **Separation of Concerns:** The structure separates pages, reusable UI components, and static content.\n-   **Component-Based UI:** The UI will be built by composing small, reusable components. The core components from `automationsaas` (homepage layout) and `aiascent.game` (report viewer) will be adapted and placed in `src/components/`.\n-   **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Next.js will be used to pre-render the homepage and whitepaper pages as static HTML, ensuring fast load times and good SEO.\n-   **Strong Typing:** TypeScript will be used throughout the project to ensure type safety and improve developer experience.\n</file>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-A7-Development-and-Testing-Guide.md\">\n# Artifact A7: aiascent-dev - Development and Testing Guide\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A generic template for a development and testing guide.\n- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **aiascent.dev** website locally.\n\n## 2. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed using npm.\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code and watch for changes, run the following command:\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\nThis will start the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`, and automatically recompile your code when you save a file.\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOpen your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the homepage of the `aiascent.dev` website.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\nYou can use your browser's developer tools to debug the frontend React components. For backend (server-side rendering) debugging in Next.js, you can attach the VS Code debugger by creating a `launch.json` configuration.\n\n## 3. Testing\n\nThe project will be configured with a testing framework (e.g., Jest with React Testing Library). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n</file>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-A9-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\">\n# Artifact A9: aiascent-dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A generic template for a guide on setting up a new project with Git and GitHub, including a sample workflow.\n- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, git, github, version control, workflow\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local project folder (`C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`) into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines the sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2. Prerequisites\n\n*   You have `git` installed on your machine.\n*   You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** Enter `aiascent-dev`.\n4.  **Description:** (Optional) \"Promotional website and interactive whitepaper for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) project.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files, and this will prevent conflicts.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions. We will use the section titled **\"...or push an existing repository from the command line\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory (`C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`). Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files:**\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"Initial commit: Pre-boot with planning artifacts from DCE C117\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\nAfter these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files.\n\n## 4. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work, without losing your place.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean. You can check this with `git status`. All your previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate a Prompt and Get Responses\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Use this prompt to get multiple responses (e.g., 4 to 8) from your preferred AI model.\n\n### Step 3: Paste and Parse\nPaste the responses into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 4: Accept and Test\n1.  Review the responses and find one that looks promising.\n2.  Select that response and use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Now, compile and test the application (`npm run dev`). Does it work? Does it have errors?\n\n### Step 5: The \"Restore\" Loop\nThis is where Git becomes a powerful part of the workflow.\n\n*   **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs, don't work as expected):**\n    1.  Use the **\"Restore Baseline\"** button in the DCE, or run `git restore .` in the terminal.\n    2.  This command instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    3.  You are now back to a clean state and can go back to the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, select a *different* AI response, and click \"Accept Selected Files\" again to test the next proposed solution.\n\n*   **If the changes are good:**\n    1.  Use the **\"Baseline (Commit)\"** button in the DCE, or use the Source Control panel in VS Code.\n    2.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"Feat: Implement homepage header via AI C5\").\n    3.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle from a new, clean state.\n\nThis iterative loop of `accept -> test -> restore` allows you to rapidly audition multiple AI-generated solutions without fear of corrupting your codebase.\n</file>"

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nAs the senior project architect for `aiascent.dev`, I have completed the project initialization (Cycle 0). I analyzed the project scope (M4) and reviewed the available context, including the flattened repositories of related projects (`automationsaas` and `aiascent.game`).\n\nBased on this analysis, I have developed a strategy that leverages these existing assets to accelerate development. The `automationsaas` project will provide the foundational Next.js/TypeScript/TailwindCSS shell, and the `aiascent.game` project will provide the interactive report viewer component, which will be ported and adapted as the primary showcase feature.\n\nI have generated nine foundational artifacts based on the provided templates (M6 Static Context). This includes the mandatory setup guides (A14 GitHub Setup and A7 Development Guide) and core planning documents that reflect the asset reuse strategy (A1 Vision, A2 Requirements, A3 Technical Plan, A11 Roadmap). I also created the necessary process documents (A16 Environment Setup, A4 Task Checklist) and the Master Artifact List (A0).\n\nNo code files were generated, adhering to the Cycle 0 constraints.

Key Architectural Concepts\n\n  - **Asset Reuse:** The primary architectural concept is the reuse of the `automationsaas` shell. This provides a pre-configured environment with styling, theming, and basic layout structures.\n  - **Component Porting:** The core interactive feature (the viewer) will be ported from `aiascent.game` and encapsulated within the `src/components/whitepaper/` directory.\n  - **Next.js App Router:** Utilizing the file-system-based routing and React Server Components capabilities of the Next.js App Router.\n  - **Decoupling and Simplification:** Removing unnecessary dependencies from the `automationsaas` shell (like authentication, billing, and database logic) to create a lean promotional site.\n    \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A11-aiascentdev-Implementation-Roadmap.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A11: aiascentdev - Implementation Roadmap\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A step-by-step roadmap for the implementation of `aiascent.dev`, focusing on the migration of existing assets and the development of the interactive showcase.\n  - **Tags:** roadmap, implementation, planning, strategy, migration, porting\n\n## 1\\. Overview & Goal\n\nThis document provides a clear, step-by-step roadmap for the implementation of **aiascent.dev**. The roadmap prioritizes the migration of the `automationsaas` shell and the porting of the `aiascent.game` viewer component to rapidly achieve the Phase 1 goals.\n\n## 2\\. Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Shell Migration and Cleanup (Est. Cycle 1-2)\n\n  - **Goal:** Establish the project foundation by migrating and cleaning the `automationsaas` shell.\n  - **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Migration:** Copy the core files from `automationsaas` (`package.json`, configs, `src/app`, `src/components/global`, `src/components/ui`, `src/providers`, `src/lib`).\n    2.  **Dependency Cleanup:** Update `package.json` to remove dependencies not needed for `aiascent.dev` (e.g., Prisma, Stripe, Clerk, specific API clients).\n    3.  **Code Cleanup:** Remove authentication, billing, database access, and API route files from the `src` directory.\n    4.  **Rebranding:** Update the site name, logo, and basic styling in the Navbar and layout files.\n    5.  **Validation:** Ensure the cleaned shell builds and runs (`npm install && npm run dev`).\n  - **Outcome:** A clean, rebranded Next.js application shell ready for feature development.\n\n### Step 2: Interactive Whitepaper - Porting and Refactoring (Est. Cycle 3-5)\n\n  - **Goal:** Port the viewer component from `aiascent.game` and adapt it for the new environment.\n  - **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Identification:** Analyze the `ReportViewer` in `aiascent.game` and identify all dependencies (child components, utility functions, data structures).\n    2.  **Porting:** Copy the relevant files into `src/components/whitepaper/`.\n    3.  **Refactoring:** Rename the component to `InteractiveWhitepaper`. Remove game-specific state management and styling. Adapt it to use local state or a new, dedicated store.\n    4.  **Data Integration:** Define the JSON data structure for the whitepaper and implement the logic to load it from `src/data`.\n  - **Outcome:** A functional, standalone interactive viewer component running within the `aiascent.dev` shell.\n\n### Step 3: Content Integration and UI Development (Est. Cycle 6-8)\n\n  - **Goal:** Integrate the actual whitepaper content and build the remaining UI.\n  - **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Content Conversion:** Convert the DCE whitepaper into the required JSON format.\n    2.  **Page Creation:** Create the `/whitepaper` route and integrate the `InteractiveWhitepaper` component.\n    3.  **Landing Page:** Develop the main landing page (`src/app/page.tsx`) with marketing content about the DCE, adapting the existing `automationsaas` landing page design.\n  - **Outcome:** A feature-complete Phase 1 website.\n\n### Step 4: Polish and Deployment (Est. Cycle 9+)\n\n  - **Goal:** Refine the application and deploy it to production.\n  - **Tasks:**\n    1.  **UI/UX Polish:** Address responsiveness issues and fine-tune styling.\n    2.  **Testing:** Conduct thorough cross-browser testing.\n    3.  **Deployment:** Configure the hosting environment and deploy the website.\n  - **Outcome:** A stable, polished, and publicly accessible website.\n    \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A7-aiascentdev-Development-and-Testing-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A7: aiascentdev - Development and Testing Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Standard procedures for running, debugging, and testing the `aiascent.dev` Next.js application locally.\n  - **Tags:** development, testing, debugging, workflow, nextjs, guide\n\n## 1\\. Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **aiascent.dev** application locally.\n\n## 2\\. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed. This project inherits the configuration from `automationsaas`. Navigate to the project root and run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n# or if using yarn (as specified in automationsaas package.json):\n# yarn install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo start the Next.js development server with hot-reloading, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or:\n# yarn dev\n```\n\nThis will compile the code and watch for changes.\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOnce the development server is running, it will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the configuration). Open this URL in your web browser to view the application. Next.js will automatically update the browser when you save changes to the source files.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\nYou can use your browser's built-in Developer Tools (Inspector, Console, Debugger) to debug the client-side React application.\n\nFor debugging server-side code (e.g., React Server Components or API routes), logs will appear in the terminal where you ran the dev command.\n\n## 3\\. Testing\n\nThe project inherits the testing configuration from `automationsaas` (Jest). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n# or:\n# yarn test\n```\n\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n\n## 4\\. Building for Production\n\nTo create an optimized production build of the application, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n# or:\n# yarn build\n```\n\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A14-aiascentdev-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A14: aiascentdev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A step-by-step guide with the necessary git commands to initialize the `aiascent.dev` project repository and link it to GitHub, including the DCE testing workflow.\n  - **Tags:** git, github, version control, setup, repository, workflow, dce\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines a sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n  * You have `git` installed on your machine.\n  * You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev` (or similar).\n4.  **Description:** \"Promotional and educational website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files (the artifacts generated in Cycle 0):**\n\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with project planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your new GitHub repository page.\n\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\n## 4\\. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle (like Cycle 1), ensure your working directory is clean (`git status` should show nothing to commit).\n\n### Step 2: Generate a Prompt and Get Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file based on the task list (A4). Use this prompt to get multiple responses from your preferred AI model.\n\n### Step 3: Paste and Parse\n\nPaste the responses into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 4: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and find one that looks promising.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button to write the AI's proposed changes (e.g., the migration of the `automationsaas` shell) to your workspace.\n3.  Now, try to build and run the application (`npm install`, `npm run dev`). Does it work?\n\n### Step 5: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n  * **If the changes are bad (e.g., the migration was incomplete, the app doesn't build):**\n\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    3.  This command instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit (Cycle 0).\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response in the DCE panel and try again.\n\n  * **If the changes are good:**\n\n    1.  Open the Source Control panel in VS Code.\n    2.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    3.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Migrate and clean automationsaas shell\").\n    4.  Commit the changes.\n    5.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle (Cycle 2).\n        \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A16-aiascentdev-Developer-Environment-Setup-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A16: aiascentdev - Developer Environment Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A guide for setting up the local development environment, including required tools (Node.js, Git, VS Code) and configuration.\n  - **Tags:** environment, setup, tools, configuration, onboarding, guide\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis document provides a step-by-step guide for setting up the local development environment required to build and run **aiascent.dev**.\n\n## 2\\. System Requirements\n\n  - **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux\n  - **Package Manager:** npm (included with Node.js) or yarn\n  - **Node.js Version:** v18.17.0 or later (LTS recommended, e.g., v20.x)\n  - **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code (Recommended)\n\n## 3\\. Required Tools & Software\n\nPlease install the following tools if you do not already have them:\n\n1.  **Node.js:** Download the LTS version from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).\n2.  **Git:** Download from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n3.  **Visual Studio Code:** Download from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n### Recommended VS Code Extensions\n\n  - ESLint\n  - Prettier - Code formatter\n  - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense\n  - Data Curation Environment (DCE)\n\n## 4\\. Step-by-Step Setup Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Clone the Repository\n\nFirst, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.\n\n```bash\n# Replace with your repository URL\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/aiascent-dev.git\ncd aiascent-dev\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install Project Dependencies\n\nNext, install all the necessary project dependencies.\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n# or yarn install\n```\n\n### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (If Applicable)\n\nIf the project requires environment variables, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project. Next.js automatically loads variables from this file.\n\n```bash\n# Example content for .env.local:\n# NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=UA-XXXXX-Y\n```\n\n### Step 4: Run the Development Server\n\nTo start the local development server, run the following command.\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or yarn dev\n```\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Setup\n\nOnce the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the configuration). You should see the `aiascent.dev` landing page.\n\n## 5\\. Managing Environment Variables and Secrets\n\nTo provide an AI assistant with the necessary context about which environment variables are available without exposing sensitive secrets, follow this best practice:\n\n1.  **Use `.env.local` for secrets:** Keep your actual secrets in `.env.local`.\n2.  **Create a `.env.dce` file (or `.env.example`):** Make a copy of your `.env.local` file.\n3.  **Redact Secret Values:** In the copied file, replace all sensitive values with the placeholder `[REDACTED]`.\n4.  **Include in Context:** When using the DCE, select the redacted file (`.env.dce` or `.env.example`) to include it in the prompt context.\n5.  **Exclude Secrets from Git:** Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes `.env.local` (Next.js default) to prevent your actual secrets from being committed to version control.\n    \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A4-aiascentdev-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A4: aiascentdev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, starting with the migration of the `automationsaas` shell.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, process, planning, workflow, migration\n\n## 1\\.

Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Prerequisites\n\nEnsure you have the following installed:\n\n  - Node.js (LTS version recommended)\n  - npm (or yarn/pnpm)\n\n### Step 2: Install Dependencies\n\nNavigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and install all project dependencies.\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Step 3: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code and start the Next.js development server with hot-reloading, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThis will watch for changes in your source files and automatically update the application in the browser.\n\n### Step 4: Running the Application\n\nOnce the development server is running, you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to:\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3000\n```\n\n### Step 5: Debugging\n\nYou can debug the client-side application using your browser's developer tools (Inspector, Console, Debugger). For server-side code (e.g., API routes or Server Components), you can attach a debugger to the Node.js process or use `console.log` statements which will appear in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running.\n\n## 3\\. Testing\n\nThe project will be configured with a testing framework (e.g., Jest or Cypress). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\n\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console. (Note: Testing framework setup is planned for a future cycle).\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A14. aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A14: aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A guide on setting up the aiascent.dev project with Git and GitHub, including a sample workflow for using Git with the DCE.\n  - **Tags:** git, github, version control, workflow, setup, guide\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines a sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n  * You have `git` installed on your machine.\n  * You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev`.\n4.  **Description:** (Optional) \"Promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"C0: Initial project setup and planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\n## 4\\. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean (check with `git status`). All previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate and Parse Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Get multiple responses from your AI model, paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 3: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and select a promising one.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Compile and test the application (e.g., `npm run dev`). Does it work? Does it have errors?\n\n### Step 4: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\nThis is where Git integrates seamlessly with the workflow.\n\n  * **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs):**\n\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    3.  This command instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response in the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and test the next solution.\n\n  * **If the changes are good:**\n\n    1.  Open the Source Control panel in VS Code.\n    2.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    3.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding\").\n    4.  Commit the changes.\n    5.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle.\n\nThis iterative loop of `accept -> test -> restore` allows you to rapidly audition multiple AI-generated solutions without fear of corrupting your codebase.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A17. aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A17: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1\\.

Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Foundational Setup & Scaffolding (Cycle 1)\n\n\\-   **Goal:** Create the basic project structure and initialize the development environment.\n\\-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Initialize Project:** Set up the Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS (A3).\n    2.  **Version Control:** Initialize the Git repository and push to GitHub (A14).\n    3.  **Basic Layout:** Implement the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) with placeholder Header and Footer components.\n\\-   **Outcome:** A runnable Next.js application with the core technical structure in place.\n\n### Step 2: Landing Page UI Development (Cycle 2-3)\n\n\\-   **Goal:** Build the main landing page UI and core navigation.\n\\-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Header & Footer:** Implement the functional Header and Footer components.\n    2.  **Hero Section:** Create the main hero section with the headline and primary CTA.\n    3.  **Features Section:** Implement the section detailing the key benefits of the DCE.\n    4.  **Styling & Responsiveness:** Apply the visual design using TailwindCSS and ensure responsiveness.\n\\-   **Outcome:** A visually complete and responsive landing page.\n\n### Step 3: Interactive Showcase Implementation (Cycle 4-6)\n\n\\-   **Goal:** Develop the core feature of Phase 1: the interactive showcase component.\n\\-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Data Structure:** Define and create the JSON data source (`src/data/whitepaperContent.json`).\n    2.  **Showcase Page:** Create the `/showcase` page route.\n    3.  **Component Development:** Build the `InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx` component, including data loading and navigation logic.\n    4.  **Integration:** Integrate the component into the showcase page with accompanying explanatory text.\n\\-   **Outcome:** A functional interactive showcase that demonstrates the DCE's capabilities.\n\n### Step 4: Polish, Testing, and Deployment (Cycle 7+)\n\n\\-   **Goal:** Finalize the content, fix bugs, and deploy the website.\n\\-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Content Finalization:** Review and finalize all text content and imagery.\n    2.  **Cross-Browser/Device Testing:** Ensure the website works correctly across major browsers and devices.\n    3.  **SEO Optimization:** Implement basic SEO metadata.\n    4.  **Deployment:** Configure the hosting environment and deploy the application.\n\\-   **Outcome:** The Phase 1 website is live and accessible to the public.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A7-Development-and-Testing-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A7: aiascent.dev - Development and Testing Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A guide providing the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the aiascent.dev Next.js website locally.\n  - **Tags:** documentation, project setup, development, testing, nextjs, workflow\n\n## 1\\. Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **aiascent.dev** application locally.\n\n## 2\\. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed. Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n# or if using yarn\n# yarn install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code and start the Next.js development server with hot-reloading, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOnce the development server is running, it will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your web browser to view the application. The server will automatically refresh the page when you save changes to the source files.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\nDebugging is primarily done using the browser's developer tools (DevTools).\n\n  - **Client-Side Debugging:** Open DevTools (F12 or right-click -\\> Inspect) and navigate to the \"Console\" tab for logs or the \"Sources\" (Chrome/Edge) / \"Debugger\" (Firefox) tab to set breakpoints directly in the TypeScript source code (thanks to source maps).\n  - **React State:** Install the React Developer Tools browser extension to inspect component state and props.\n\n## 3\\. Testing\n\nThe project will be configured with a testing framework (e.g., Jest and React Testing Library) as development progresses. To run the test suite, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\n\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n\n## 4\\. Building for Production\n\nTo create an optimized production build of the application, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis generates the necessary files for deployment. You can then run the production build locally using:\n\n```bash\nnpm run start\n```\n\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A14-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A14: aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A guide on setting up the aiascent.dev project with Git and GitHub, including the essential workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n  - **Tags:** git, github, version control, workflow, setup, dce\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines the standard workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n\\*   You have `git` installed on your machine.\n\\*   You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev` (or similar).\n4.  **Description:** \"Promotional and educational website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n    ` bash     git init      `\n\n2.  **Create/Update `.gitignore`:** Ensure you have a `.gitignore` file. Crucially, it must include `.vscode/` to prevent DCE state files from causing issues, along with standard Next.js ignores. You can create a basic one with:\n    ```bash\n    echo \"node_modules/\\n.next/\\n.env.local\\n.vscode/\" > .gitignore\n    ```\n\n3.  **Add all existing files:**\n    ` bash     git add .      `\n\n4.  **Create the first commit:**\n    ` bash     git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with project artifacts\"      `\n\n5.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n    ` bash     git branch -M main      `\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n    ` bash     git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git      `\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n    ` bash     git push -u origin main      `\n\n## 4\\. Standard Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is essential for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean (`git status`). All previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate and Parse Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Get multiple responses from your AI model, paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 3: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and select one that looks promising.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button (or the integrated \"Baseline\" feature if available) to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Compile and test the website (`npm run dev`). Does it work? Are there errors?\n\n### Step 4: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n\\*   **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs):**\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    3.  This instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response in the DCE panel and test the next solution.\n\n\\*   **If the changes are good:**\n    1.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    2.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding\").\n    3.  Commit the changes (`git commit -m \"...\"`).\n    4.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A4: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1\\.

Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files:** (Ensure you have a proper `.gitignore` file first, which will be created in Cycle 1)\n\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with project planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\nAfter these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files.\n\n## 4\\. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is crucial for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean (`git status`). All your previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate a Prompt and Get Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Use this prompt to get multiple responses from your AI model.\n\n### Step 3: Paste and Parse\n\nPaste the responses into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 4: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and select one that looks promising.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button (or the integrated \"Baseline & Accept\" feature if available in your DCE version) to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Now, compile and test the application (`npm run dev`). Does the website look correct? Does the new feature work?\n\n### Step 5: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n  * **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs, break the layout):**\n\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .` (or use the DCE's integrated \"Restore Baseline\" button).\n    3.  This instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response in the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and test the next proposed solution.\n\n  * **If the changes are good:**\n\n    1.  Open the Source Control panel in VS Code.\n    2.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    3.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding\").\n    4.  Commit the changes.\n    5.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle from a new, clean state.\n        \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-A17-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A17: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, bugs, and progress for the aiascent.dev website, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1\\.

Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **aiascent.dev** application locally, based on the Next.js framework inherited from the `automationsaas` shell.\n\n## 2\\. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed. Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run the appropriate command based on the package manager used in the `automationsaas` shell (check `package.json` or look for lock files).\n\n```bash\n# If using npm\nnpm install\n\n# If using yarn (common in automationsaas)\n# yarn install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code, watch for changes, and enable Fast Refresh (hot-reloading), run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or\n# yarn dev\n```\n\nThis will start the Next.js development server.\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOnce the development server is running, the application will typically be available at:\n`http://localhost:3000`\n\nOpen this URL in your web browser. The browser will automatically update when you make changes to the source code.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\n  - **Client-Side Debugging:** Use your browser's Developer Tools (DevTools) to inspect components, monitor network requests, and view console logs.\n  - **Server-Side Debugging:** Logs from server-side rendering or API routes will appear directly in the terminal where the dev server is running.\n\n## 3\\. Testing\n\nThe project inherits the testing configuration from the `automationsaas` shell (likely Jest). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n# or\n# yarn test\n```\n\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent.dev-A14-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A14: aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A step-by-step guide with the necessary git commands to initialize the aiascent.dev project repository and establish the standard DCE testing workflow.\n  - **Tags:** git, github, version control, setup, repository, workflow, dce\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to GitHub, and outlines the standard workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n  * You have `git` installed on your machine.\n  * You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  Click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev`.\n4.  **Description:** \"Promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing the files generated in Cycle 0 and the `automationsaas` shell.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Ensure `.gitignore` is correct:** The `.gitignore` file should be inherited from the `automationsaas` shell in Cycle 1. It is crucial that it includes `.vscode/` to prevent the DCE extension's state files from being committed.\n\n3.  **Add all existing files:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n4.  **Create the first commit:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with project planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n5.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your new GitHub repository page.\n\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\n## 4\\. Standard Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is essential for the DCE workflow, enabling rapid testing and clean reversions of AI-generated code.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle (e.g., Cycle 1), ensure your working directory is clean (check with `git status`).\n\n### Step 2: Generate and Parse Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate `prompt.md`. Get multiple AI responses, paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, and \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 3: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Select the most promising response.\n2.  Use **\"Accept Selected Files\"** (or the \"Baseline/Accept\" flow if implemented in your DCE version) to write the changes to your workspace.\n3.  Run the application (e.g., `npm run dev`) and test the changes.\n\n### Step 4: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n  * **If the changes are bad (e.g., bugs, undesired outcome):**\n\n    1.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    2.  This instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting to the last commit.\n    3.  You are now clean and can select a *different* AI response in the Panel and try again.\n\n  * **If the changes are good:**\n\n    1.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    2.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding from automationsaas\").\n    3.  Commit the changes.\n    4.  You are now ready for the next development cycle.\n        \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent.dev-A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n## 1\\.

Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines a sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n\\*   You have `git` installed on your machine.\n\\*   You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev`.\n4.  **Description:** (Optional) \"Promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n    ` bash     git init      `\n\n2.  **Add a .gitignore (Important for Next.js and DCE):**\n    Ensure a `.gitignore` file exists in the root directory (Next.js usually creates one). Crucially, ensure it ignores `.vscode/` to prevent DCE state files from causing issues.\n    ```\n    # Example entries:\n    node_modules\n    .next/\n    .env.local\n    # DCE History (Crucial)\n    .vscode/\n    ```\n\n3.  **Add all existing files:**\n    ` bash     git add .      `\n\n4.  **Create the first commit:**\n    ` bash     git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with documentation artifacts\"      `\n\n5.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n    ` bash     git branch -M main      `\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n    ` bash     git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git      `\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n    ` bash     git push -u origin main      `\n\n## 4\\. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean (`git status`). All your previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate and Parse Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Get multiple responses from your AI model, paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 3: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and select one that looks promising.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Compile and test the application (`npm run dev`). Does it work? Does it have errors?\n\n### Step 4: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n\\*   **If the changes are bad:**\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    3.  This instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response to test.\n\n\\*   **If the changes are good:**\n    1.  Stage the changes: `git add .`\n    2.  Commit the changes: `git commit -m \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding\"`\n    3.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent.dev-A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A4: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** The primary task tracking document for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity for efficient workflow management.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1\\.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis is Cycle 1, dedicated to the initial scaffolding of the `aiascent.dev` project as detailed in A3 (Technical Scaffolding Plan) and A4 (Task Checklist T-1).\n\nI have generated the complete foundational structure for a modern Next.js application using the App Router, configured with TypeScript and TailwindCSS. Furthermore, I have integrated the Shadcn/ui component library, as suggested optionally in A3, to provide a robust foundation for rapid UI development.\n\nThis includes all necessary configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `components.json`, etc.), core utility files (`src/lib/utils.ts`), the theme provider setup (`src/providers/theme-provider.tsx`), and the initial application layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`). I also generated the base UI components required for the layout (`Button.tsx`, `DropdownMenu.tsx`) and the `ModeToggle.tsx` component, along with placeholder Header, Footer, and Showcase components/data as defined in A3.\n\nThe project is now initialized and ready for dependency installation and local execution.\n\n**Files Updated/Created:**\n\n  * .gitignore\n  * components.json\n  * next.config.mjs\n  * package.json\n  * postcss.config.mjs\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/globals.css\n  * src/app/layout.tsx\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/app/showcase/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/mode-toggle.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n  * src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/button.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx\n  * src/data/whitepaperContent.json\n  * src/lib/utils.ts\n  * src/providers/theme-provider.tsx\n  * tailwind.config.ts\n  * tsconfig.json\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Create `package.json`:** Define project metadata and dependencies for Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn/ui related libraries.\n2.  **Create Configuration Files:** Generate `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `next.config.mjs`, and `components.json`.\n3.  **Create `.gitignore`:** Ensure standard Next.js and DCE directories (`.vscode/`) are ignored.\n4.  **Create Utility Files:** Generate `src/lib/utils.ts` (for `cn` helper) and `src/providers/theme-provider.tsx`.\n5.  **Create Core Application Files:** Implement `src/app/globals.css`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, and a placeholder `src/app/page.tsx`.\n6.  **Create Base UI Components:** Generate `src/components/ui/button.tsx` and `src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx` (required for ModeToggle).\n7.  **Create Layout Components:** Generate `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`, and `src/components/global/mode-toggle.tsx`.\n8.  **Create Showcase Placeholders:** Generate `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` and `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`.\n9.  **Create Data Placeholder:** Generate `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`.\n10. **Update A4 Checklist:** Mark Task T-1 (Project Scaffolding) as completed.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\n\n1.  **Install Dependencies:** Please run `npm install` (or `yarn install`/`pnpm install`) in the project root directory after accepting these files to install the dependencies defined in `package.json`.\n2.  **Start Development Server:** Run `npm run dev` to verify the initial setup.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis is Cycle 1, dedicated to initializing the `aiascent.dev` project scaffolding as outlined in the Technical Scaffolding Plan (A3) and Task T-1 of the Universal Task Checklist (A4). The objective is to establish a robust, modern foundation using Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, incorporating the structure for the shadcn/ui component library from the outset.\n\nI have generated the complete foundational setup by creating all necessary configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, etc.), utility files (`src/lib/utils.ts`), and providers (`ThemeProvider`). I utilized configuration patterns observed in the `automationsaas` context (M7) as a reference for best practices in this technology stack.\n\nThe core application structure is established, including the root layout, global styles, and the initial landing page. Placeholder components for the Header and Footer have been created, integrating a functional theme toggle (ModeToggle).\n\nFurthermore, the scaffolding for the Interactive Showcase feature has been created according to A3. This includes the data placeholder (`src/data/whitepaperContent.json`), the showcase page (`src/app/showcase/page.tsx`), and the interactive component (`src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`). The data loading strategy is implemented correctly: the JSON is imported in the server component (`showcase/page.tsx`) and passed as a prop to the client component (`InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`).\n\nFinally, I updated the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to mark T-1 as complete and provided instructions for the curator to initialize the project.\n\n**Files Created/Updated:**\n\n  * .eslintrc.json\n  * .gitignore\n  * components.json\n  * next.config.mjs\n  * next-env.d.ts\n  * package.json\n  * postcss.config.mjs\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/globals.css\n  * src/app/layout.tsx\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/app/showcase/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/mode-toggle.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n  * src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/button.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx\n  * src/data/whitepaperContent.json\n  * src/lib/utils.ts\n  * src/providers/theme-provider.tsx\n  * tailwind.config.ts\n  * tsconfig.json\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Generate Configuration Files:** Create `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `next.config.mjs`, `.gitignore`, `components.json`, `.eslintrc.json`, and `next-env.d.ts`.\n2.  **Generate Utility Files:** Create `src/lib/utils.ts` (for `cn` helper).\n3.  **Generate Providers and Theming:** Create `src/providers/theme-provider.tsx` and `src/components/global/mode-toggle.tsx`.\n4.  **Generate Core Application Structure:** Create `src/app/globals.css`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, and `src/app/page.tsx`.\n5.  **Generate Layout Components:** Create `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` and `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`.\n6.  **Generate Showcase Structure:** Create `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`, `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`, and `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`. Implement the data loading strategy (import in server component, pass to client component).\n7.  **Generate Basic UI Components:** Create necessary shadcn/ui components (`Button.tsx`, `DropdownMenu.tsx`).\n8.  **Update A4 Checklist:** Mark Task T-1 as complete and prepare for T-2.\n9.  **Provide Curator Instructions:** Outline steps to install dependencies and run the project.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\nAfter accepting these files, please perform the following actions in your terminal at the project root (`C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`):\n\n1.  **Install Dependencies:**\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n    *(Note: If you prefer using yarn, as indicated in the `packageManager` field of `package.json`, you can run `yarn install` instead.)*\n\n2.  **Initialize Git and Commit:** (As detailed in A14, the `.gitignore` file is included in this response)\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    git add .\n    git commit -m \"C1: Initialize Next.js project scaffolding and structure\"\n    git branch -M main\n    # Add your remote and push if ready (see A14 for details)\n    ```\n\n3.  **Start the Development Server:**\n\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n\n4.  **Verify:** Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to ensure the basic application is running.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nCycle 1: Project Initialization and Scaffolding.\n\nThe objective of this cycle is to initialize the `aiascent.dev` project by creating the foundational scaffolding as outlined in the Technical Scaffolding Plan (A3) and Task T-1 of the Universal Task Checklist (A4).\n\nI have generated the core configuration files required for a modern Next.js application utilizing the App Router, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. This includes:\n\n  - `package.json` with necessary dependencies (including common utilities like `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `tailwindcss-animate`, and `lucide-react`).\n  - `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration.\n  - TailwindCSS setup files (`tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`).\n  - `next.config.mjs` for Next.js configuration.\n  - A comprehensive `.gitignore` file, including the crucial `.vscode/` ignore for DCE compatibility.\n\nFurthermore, I established the initial application structure: the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`), the global stylesheet (`src/app/globals.css`) with standard CSS variables for theming, and a placeholder home page (`src/app/page.tsx`). I also included `src/lib/utils.ts` (for the `cn` helper).\n\nTo establish the planned architecture (A3), I generated functional placeholder files for the layout components (`Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`), the showcase page (`src/app/showcase/page.tsx`), the interactive component (`InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`), and the data source (`src/data/whitepaperContent.json`).\n\nFinally, I updated the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to reflect the completion of T-1.\n\nThe project is now scaffolded and ready for the curator to install dependencies and begin development.\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Create `package.json`**: Define project metadata and dependencies for Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and common utilities.\n2.  **Create `tsconfig.json`**: Set up TypeScript configuration suitable for Next.js.\n3.  **Create `tailwind.config.ts`**: Initialize the TailwindCSS configuration using a standard structure compatible with modern practices (like shadcn/ui).\n4.  **Create `postcss.config.mjs`**: Configuration file required for TailwindCSS processing.\n5.  **Create `next.config.mjs`**: Basic Next.js configuration file.\n6.  **Create `.gitignore`**: Define files and directories to be ignored by Git, including Next.js defaults and DCE specifics (`.vscode/`).\n7.  **Create `src/lib/utils.ts`**: Create the `cn` utility function for Tailwind class merging.\n8.  **Create `src/app/globals.css`**: Global stylesheet containing Tailwind directives and CSS variables for theming.\n9.  **Create `src/app/layout.tsx`**: The root layout for the application using the App Router, integrating Header and Footer.\n10. **Create `src/app/page.tsx`**: The main landing page (placeholder content).\n11. **Create Placeholder Structure Files**: Generate functional placeholders for `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`, `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`.\n12. **Create Placeholder Data**: Generate `src/data/whitepaperContent.json` with sample data.\n13. **Update `A4.

It aims to be more than a static landing page; it will be a living testament to the capabilities of the DCE by showcasing complex, interactive components that were themselves built using the extension."
