I understand the plan to create a new website for DCE at `aiascent.dev`, repurposing existing assets to build a homepage and an interactive whitepaper. My course of action is to answer your technical hosting questions, provide the initial planning and documentation artifacts to \"pre-boot\" this new website project, and give you a clear list of which existing DCE artifacts you should copy over for context.\n\nI will begin by creating a new artifact that provides a comprehensive plan for hosting both `aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev` on your single server using Caddy, which is the best-practice solution for your setup. Then, I will generate the initial set of planning documents for the new website project itself, including a project vision, technical plan, and a specific plan for the interactive whitepaper. Finally, I will provide a clear, actionable list of the existing DCE artifacts you should port over.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Answer Hosting Questions:** I will create a new artifact, **`A113. aiascent.dev - Multi-Domain Hosting Plan.md`**, to provide a definitive answer to your questions. It will explain that you can point both domains' DNS records to your single IP and use a reverse proxy like Caddy to route traffic based on the domain name requested. I will provide a sample `Caddyfile` configuration.\n2.  **Pre-boot `aiascent-dev` Project:** I will generate the initial set of documentation artifacts required to start the new website project using the DCE workflow.\n    *   Create **`A114. aiascent.dev - Project Vision and Goals.md`** to define the scope and purpose of the new website.\n    *   Create **`A115. aiascent.dev - Technical Scaffolding Plan.md`** to propose a technical stack (Next.js, React, TypeScript) suitable for building the homepage and interactive report viewer.\n    *   Create **`A116. aiascent.dev - Interactive Whitepaper Plan.md`** to detail the requirements and implementation strategy for adapting the report viewer from `aiascent.game`.\n    *   Create **`A117. aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List.md`** to serve as the `A0` file for this new project, cataloging all the newly created planning documents.\n3.  **Provide Porting Instructions:** I will include a `<curator_activity>` section with a checklist of the essential documentation artifacts from the *current* DCE extension project that you should copy into your new `C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev\\context\\dce` directory to provide context for that new development effort.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A113. aiascent.dev - Multi-Domain Hosting Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A113: aiascent.dev - Multi-Domain Hosting Plan\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A technical guide explaining how to host multiple domains (aiascent.game and aiascent.dev) on a single server with one public IP address using a Caddy reverse proxy.\n- **Tags:** hosting, networking, dns, caddy, reverse proxy, multi-domain\n\n## 1. Overview & Goal\n\nThis document provides the technical solution for hosting both `aiascent.game` and the new `aiascent.dev` website on the same home server that is also running the vLLM instance. The goal is to configure the network and server to correctly route incoming traffic to the appropriate application based on the requested domain name.\n\nThe recommended and most robust solution is to use a reverse proxy, and since you are already using Caddy, we will expand that configuration.\n\n## 2. The Architecture\n\nThe setup involves three main parts: DNS, Port Forwarding, and the Caddy Reverse Proxy.\n\n```\n+----------------+      +----------------+      +-----------------+      +---------------------+\n|   DNS Records  |      |   AT&T Router  |      |  Caddy Server   |----->| aiascent.game (App) |\n| aiascent.game  |----->|                |      | (Reverse Proxy) |      | (localhost:3001)    |\n| aiascent.dev   |      | (Public IP)    |----->|                 |      +---------------------+\n+----------------+      |                |      |                 |\n                        | (Ports 80/443) |      |                 |      +---------------------+\n                        +----------------+      +-----------------+----->| aiascent.dev (App)  |\n                                                                         | (localhost:3002)    |\n                                                                         +---------------------+\n```\n\n## 3. Step-by-Step Configuration\n\n### Step 1: DNS Configuration\nYou are correct in your thinking. You need to configure the DNS \"A\" records for both of your domains to point to the same public IP address provided by your AT&T router.\n\n-   **`aiascent.game` -> A Record -> `[Your Public IP]`**\n-   **`aiascent.dev` -> A Record -> `[Your Public IP]`**\n\n### Step 2: Port Forwarding (AT&T Router)\nYour router is already configured to forward traffic for `aiascent.game`, but you should ensure it forwards all standard web traffic to your server's *local* IP address.\n\n-   Forward incoming TCP traffic on port **80** to your server's local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).\n-   Forward incoming TCP traffic on port **443** to your server's local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).\n\nCaddy will handle receiving traffic on these ports.\n\n### Step 3: Caddy Reverse Proxy Configuration (Caddyfile)\nThis is the core of the solution. Caddy will inspect the `Host` header of each incoming request and route it to the correct backend application running on a different internal port. This allows you to run multiple web services on the same machine.\n\nBelow is a sample `Caddyfile` that handles both domains. You will run your `aiascent.game` server on port `3001` and your new `aiascent.dev` website server on a different port, like `3002`.\n\n```caddy\n# Caddyfile for Multi-Domain Hosting\n\n{\n    # Global options, like your email for Let's Encrypt SSL certificates\n    email your-email@example.com\n}\n\n# Site 1: AI Ascent Game\naiascent.game, www.aiascent.game {\n    # Caddy automatically handles HTTPS for this domain.\n    \n    # Reverse proxy all requests for aiascent.game to your game server\n    # running on localhost port 3001.\n    reverse_proxy localhost:3001\n}\n\n# Site 2: New DCE Website\naiascent.dev, www.aiascent.dev {\n    # Caddy automatically handles HTTPS for this domain as well.\n    \n    # Reverse proxy all requests for aiascent.dev to your new website server\n    # running on localhost port 3002.\n    reverse_proxy localhost:3002\n}\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n1.  A user requests `https://aiascent.dev`.\n2.  DNS resolves it to your public IP.\n3.  Your router forwards the request on port 443 to your server.\n4.  Caddy receives the request. It sees the request is for `aiascent.dev`.\n5.  It looks at the `aiascent.dev` block in the `Caddyfile` and proxies the request to the application running on `localhost:3002`.\n\nThis setup is clean, secure (with automatic HTTPS), and easily scalable if you decide to add more domains in the future.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A114. aiascent.dev - Project Vision and Goals.md\">\n# Artifact A114: aiascent.dev - Project Vision and Goals\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** High-level overview of the aiascent.dev website, its purpose as a promotional hub for DCE, and its development plan.\n- **Tags:** project vision, goals, scope, aiascent.dev, dce, website\n\n## 1. Project Vision\n\nThe vision for the `aiascent.dev` website is to create a professional, public-facing hub for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) project. It will serve as the primary destination for developers to learn about the DCE, understand its value proposition, and access resources like tutorials and the project's whitepaper.\n\nCrucially, the website itself will be a **living demonstration of the DCE's power**. It will be built from the ground up using the DCE workflow, serving as a tangible showcase of what can be achieved with this new paradigm of AI-assisted development.\n\n## 2. High-Level Goals & Phases\n\nThe project will be developed in distinct phases.\n\n### Phase 1: Homepage & Core Content\n\nThe goal of this phase is to establish the foundational website with a compelling homepage that introduces the DCE.\n\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Develop a modern, responsive single-page homepage by adapting the shell of the `automationsaas` project.\n    -   Clearly articulate the problem DCE solves (the friction in AI context management) and its solution.\n    -   Include sections for \"Features,\" \"Workflow,\" and a \"Get Started\" call-to-action that links to the future VS Code Marketplace page.\n-   **Outcome:** A functional, visually appealing landing page that effectively promotes the DCE extension.\n\n### Phase 2: The Interactive Whitepaper\n\nThis phase focuses on building a unique and engaging way to present the project's whitepaper, further demonstrating the capabilities of DCE.\n\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Create a new section/tab on the website for an \"Interactive Whitepaper.\"\n    -   This feature will be a professionalized clone of the \"Report Viewer\" from the `aiascent.game` project.\n    -   It will present the content of the DCE whitepaper (`A78`) in an engaging, multi-modal format with text, images, and potentially narration.\n-   **Outcome:** A powerful showcase piece that not only communicates the project's strategic vision but also serves as a second example of a complex web tool built using the DCE.\n\n### Phase 3: Community & Resources\n\nThis phase will expand the site to include resources for a growing user community.\n\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Add a \"Tutorials\" section, using the report viewer infrastructure to host interactive guides on \"vibe coding\" and using the DCE effectively.\n    -   Add a \"Blog\" or \"Updates\" section to communicate project progress.\n-   **Outcome:** The `aiascent.dev` site becomes the central community and learning hub for the DCE project.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A115. aiascent.dev - Technical Scaffolding Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A115: aiascent.dev - Technical Scaffolding Plan\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** Outlines the proposed technical scaffolding and file structure for the aiascent.dev website, leveraging a modern React-based framework.\n- **Tags:** technical plan, scaffolding, file structure, typescript, nextjs, react\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis document outlines the proposed technical scaffolding and file structure for the `aiascent.dev` website. The plan is to use a modern, performant, and developer-friendly technology stack that aligns well with the existing assets (`automationsaas` shell, `aiascent.game` report viewer) which are built with React.\n\n## 2. Technology Stack\n\n-   **Language:** TypeScript\n-   **Framework:** Next.js (or a similar React framework like Vite + React)\n    -   **Rationale:** Next.js provides an excellent developer experience, server-side rendering (SSR) for fast initial page loads and good SEO, static site generation (SSG) for performance, and a robust routing system. This is a perfect fit for a content-focused promotional site and a complex interactive application like the report viewer.\n-   **Styling:** SCSS or TailwindCSS (To be determined by the `automationsaas` project's existing styles).\n-   **Deployment:** The application will be built as a static or Node.js-based site, to be served locally via the Caddy reverse proxy as detailed in `A113`.\n\n## 3. Proposed File Structure (Next.js App Router)\n\nThe project will adhere to the modern Next.js App Router structure, which is feature-driven and colocates components with the pages that use them.\n\n```\naiascent-dev/\n├── src/\n│   ├── app/\n│   │   ├── (main)/\n│   │   │   ├── page.tsx            # The main homepage component\n│   │   │   └── layout.tsx          # Root layout with header/footer\n│   │   │\n│   │   ├── whitepaper/\n│   │   │   ├── page.tsx            # The interactive whitepaper/report viewer page\n│   │   │   └── layout.tsx          # Layout specific to the whitepaper section\n│   │   │\n│   │   ├── globals.css             # Global styles\n│   │   └── layout.tsx              # Root layout\n│   │\n│   ├── components/                 # Shared, reusable UI components\n│   │   ├── Header.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   └── ReportViewer/           # The adapted report viewer component\n│   │       ├── ReportViewer.tsx\n│   │       └── ... (other sub-components)\n│   │\n│   ├── lib/                        # Utility functions, constants\n│   │\n│   └── context/                    # Folder for DCE context artifacts\n│       ├── aiascentgame/\n│       ├── automationsaas/\n│       └── dce/\n│\n├── public/                         # Static assets (images, fonts)\n│\n├── package.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n└── next.config.js\n```\n\n## 4. Key Architectural Concepts\n\n-   **Component-Based UI:** The UI will be built by composing small, reusable React components.\n-   **Server Components:** Leverage Next.js Server Components for performance, fetching data on the server where possible.\n-   **Separation of Concerns:** The structure separates pages, shared components, and utility logic.\n-   **DCE-Driven Development:** The entire project will be developed using the DCE extension, with all planning and documentation residing in a `src/Artifacts` directory (to be created in Cycle 1 of that project).\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A116. aiascent.dev - Interactive Whitepaper Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A116: aiascent.dev - Interactive Whitepaper Plan\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** Details the plan to adapt the existing \"Report Viewer\" from aiascent.game into a professional, interactive whitepaper for the DCE project.\n- **Tags:** feature plan, whitepaper, report viewer, showcase, aiascent.dev\n\n## 1. Overview & Goal\n\nA key feature of the `aiascent.dev` website is the \"Interactive Whitepaper.\" This will serve as a compelling and innovative way to present the strategic vision behind the Data Curation Environment (DCE). The goal is to create this feature by adapting the existing \"Report Viewer\" component from the `aiascent.game` project, professionalizing its appearance and loading it with the content from the DCE whitepaper (`A78`).\n\nThis effort serves a dual purpose: it creates a great user experience for reading the whitepaper and acts as a powerful demonstration of reusing complex components built with the DCE workflow.\n\n## 2. User Stories\n\n| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |\n|---|---|---|\n| WP-01 | **Navigate Whitepaper** | As a visitor, I want to navigate the sections and pages of the whitepaper using a tree-like table of contents, so I can easily find the information I'm interested in. | - A side panel displays a hierarchical view of the whitepaper's sections and pages. <br> - Clicking an item in the navigator instantly loads and displays the content for that page. |\n| WP-02 | **View Multimodal Content** | As a visitor, I want to view the whitepaper content, which includes formatted text and associated images, so I can have a rich reading experience. | - The main content area displays the text for the selected page. <br> - An image viewer displays the images associated with that page. |\n| WP-03 | **Professional UI/UX** | As a visitor, I expect the interactive whitepaper to have a clean, professional, and modern design that is distinct from the in-game theme of `aiascent.game`. | - The UI is restyled with a new color palette, typography, and layout suitable for a professional project website. <br> - All game-specific elements (e.g., sci-fi borders, thematic icons) are removed or replaced. |\n\n## 3. Technical Implementation Plan\n\n1.  **Code Porting:**\n    *   The curator will copy the relevant React components for the \"Report Viewer\" from the `aiascent.game` project into the `aiascent-dev` project's `src/components/ReportViewer/` directory.\n    *   The curator will also copy the `reportContent.json` file (which contains the whitepaper text) into the `aiascent-dev` project, likely under `src/lib/data/`.\n\n2.  **Component Adaptation:**\n    *   The main `ReportViewer.tsx` component will be refactored to be a self-contained, reusable component.\n    *   It will be updated to load its content from a local JSON file instead of fetching from a game server API.\n    *   Props will be added to allow for customization of its appearance (e.g., theme, colors).\n\n3.  **Styling (`.scss` or Tailwind):**\n    *   A new stylesheet will be created specifically for the `ReportViewer` component.\n    *   All existing styles will be reviewed and overridden to match the professional aesthetic of the `aiascent.dev` website. This will be the most significant part of the work.\n\n4.  **Integration:**\n    *   The `src/app/whitepaper/page.tsx` file will import and render the newly adapted `ReportViewer` component, passing in the required data.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A117. aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List.md\">\n# Artifact A117: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The definitive list of all documentation artifacts for the aiascent.dev website project.\n- **Tags:** documentation, master artifact list, project setup, aiascent.dev\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nThis is an excellent and comprehensive plan. Your strategy to create a promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) on `aiascent.dev` is sound, and your technical approach for hosting and development is perfectly aligned with modern web practices.\n\nMy course of action is to fully support this new initiative. First, I will confirm the technical details of your hosting plan. Second, I will provide a curated list of essential artifacts from the current DCE project that you should port over to provide context for the new `aiascent-dev` project. Finally, I will \"pre-boot\" the new project by generating a complete starter set of Cycle 0 documentation artifacts, tailored to the goal of building the new promotional website and interactive whitepaper.\n\n</summary>\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Confirm Hosting Strategy:** I will confirm that your plan to point both `aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev` to the same IP address and use your `server.ts` to route traffic based on the request's hostname is a standard and effective method for hosting multiple domains on a single server. This is often referred to as using virtual hosts or server blocks.\n\n2.  **Provide Curated Artifact List:** I will provide a list of key documentation artifacts from the DCE project that are essential for bootstrapping the `aiascent-dev` website. This will ensure the new project has the necessary context regarding the DCE's vision, workflow, and technical architecture.\n\n3.  **Generate Initial Artifacts for `aiascent-dev-website`:** I will generate a complete set of \"Cycle 0\" planning documents for the new project.

Confirming Your Hosting Strategy\n\nYour plan is technically sound and is a common practice for hosting multiple websites on a single server/IP address. Here is the confirmation of the workflow:\n\n1.  **DNS Configuration:** Point the `A` records for both `aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev` to the public IP address of your home server.\n2.  **Server-Side Routing:** In your `server.ts` (or within a reverse proxy like Caddy/Nginx), you will inspect the `Host` header of incoming HTTP requests. Based on whether the host is `aiascent.game` or `aiascent.dev`, you can then route the request to the appropriate application logic (e.g., to the game server or the new DCE website server). For a Next.js application, this can be handled using middleware or API routes to check the request headers.\n\nThis setup will work perfectly for your intended purpose.\n\n### 2. Recommended DCE Artifacts to Port\n\nTo provide the necessary context for the new `aiascent-dev` project, I recommend you copy the following artifacts from this DCE project into your `C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev\\context\\dce` directory.

Key Implementation Steps\n\n1.  **Project Initialization:**\n    *   Initialize a new Next.js project in `C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`.\n    *   Set up the basic file structure as outlined above.\n\n2.  **Component Migration:**\n    *   **Homepage:** Copy the relevant layout and component files from the `automationsaas` project to serve as the shell for `src/app/page.tsx`.\n    *   **Report Viewer:** Copy the `report viewer` component and all its dependencies (child components, state management, utility functions) from the `aiascent.game` project into `src/components/report-viewer/`. This is a straightforward file copy-paste operation.\n    *   **Data:** Copy the `reportContent.json` file into the project, likely in a `/data` or `/lib` directory, so it can be imported and passed to the report viewer component.\n\n3.  **Integration and Styling:**\n    *   Integrate the cloned `ReportViewer` component into the `src/app/whitepaper/page.tsx` page.\n    *   Refactor the component's styling to match the professional aesthetic of the new `aiascent.dev` site, removing any game-specific branding.\n    *   Update the homepage content to be relevant to the DCE extension.\n\n4.  **Server Configuration:**\n    *   Update the main `server.ts` on the host machine to include logic for routing requests for `aiascent.dev` to the new Next.js application's build output.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-website-A7-Development-and-Testing-Guide.md\">\n# Artifact A7: aiascent-dev-website - Development and Testing Guide\n# Date Created: C0\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A step-by-step guide explaining how to run, debug, and test the website locally.\n- **Tags:** development, testing, debugging, workflow\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **AI Ascent Dev Website** application locally.\n\n## 2. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed using npm.\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code and watch for changes, run the following command:```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\nThis will start the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOpen a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the homepage of the website. The development server supports hot-reloading, so any changes you save in the source code will be reflected in the browser automatically.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\nYou can use your browser's developer tools to debug the frontend application. You can set breakpoints, inspect the DOM, and view console logs directly in the browser. For backend debugging of any server-side rendering logic or API routes, you can use the VS Code debugger attached to the Node.js process.\n\n## 3. Testing\n\nThe project will be configured with a testing framework (e.g., Jest with React Testing Library). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-website-A9-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\">\n# Artifact A9: aiascent-dev-website - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n# Date Created: C0\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A guide with the necessary git commands to initialize the project as a local repository and push it to a new remote repository on GitHub.\n- **Tags:** git, github, version control, setup\n\n## 1.

Prerequisites\n\n*   You have `git` installed on your machine.\n*   You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev-website`\n4.  **Description:** Promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions. We will use the section titled **\"...or push an existing repository from the command line\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory (`C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`). Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files:**\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"Initial commit: Cycle 0 planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev-website.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\nAfter these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files. You are now set up to use the DCE and Git to build this new website.\n</file>"

          "content": "<summary>\nThis is an excellent and comprehensive plan. I can confirm that your proposed hosting setup is entirely feasible and a standard industry practice. You can indeed host multiple domains (`aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev`) on a single server with one IP address. The routing is handled by a reverse proxy like Caddy, which inspects the incoming request's `Host` header (`aiascent.game` or `aiascent.dev`) and forwards the traffic to the appropriate backend service or route within your Node.js `server.ts` application. Your existing Caddy setup is well-suited for this.\n\nMy course of action is to execute your plan by providing the two key deliverables you've requested. First, I will create a new planning artifact for the `aiascent-dev` project that includes a curated list of the most relevant DCE artifacts you should port over.

It aims to provide a professional, informative website that will serve as the primary destination for users to learn about, download, and get support for the DCE. The site itself will be a testament to the power of the DCE, as it will be built using the very same artifact-driven, AI-assisted workflow it promotes.\n\n## 2. High-Level Goals & Phases\n\nThe project will be developed in distinct phases to ensure an iterative and manageable workflow.\n\n### Phase 1: Core Website and Interactive Whitepaper\n\nThe goal of this phase is to establish the foundational elements of the project, leveraging existing assets for rapid development.\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Develop a main homepage based on the `automationsaas` project shell, explaining the DCE's value proposition.\n    -   Create an \"Interactive Whitepaper\" section by adapting the report viewer from `aiascent.game`.\n    -   Host the \"Process as Asset\" whitepaper as the initial content for the viewer.\n-   **Outcome:** A live, functional website at `aiascent.dev` that introduces the DCE to the world and showcases a key component built with the DCE methodology.\n\n### Phase 2: Tutorial and \"Vibe Coding\" Hub\n\nThis phase will build upon the foundation of Phase 1 by adding educational content.\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Expand the report viewer to support multiple documents.\n    -   Create and host a series of tutorials on how to \"vibe code\" and use the DCE effectively.\n    -   Add a blog or articles section for development updates and thoughts on AI-assisted workflows.\n-   **Outcome:** `aiascent.dev` becomes a central resource for learning the \"AI Ascent\" development methodology.\n\n### Phase 3: Community and Integration\n\nThis phase focuses on building a community around the DCE and integrating with other platforms.\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Add links to the official VS Code Marketplace page.\n    -   Integrate with GitHub for issue tracking and community contributions.\n    -   Potentially add a forum or Discord integration for user support.\n-   **Outcome:** A polished and comprehensive hub for the entire DCE project and its user community.\n</file>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-A3-Technical-Scaffolding-Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A3: aiascent-dev - Technical Scaffolding Plan\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A generic template for a technical scaffolding plan.\n- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis document outlines the proposed technical scaffolding and file structure for **aiascent.dev**. This plan serves as a blueprint for the initial project setup, ensuring a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture from the start, leveraging modern web development practices.\n\n## 2. Technology Stack\n\n-   **Language:** TypeScript\n-   **Framework/Library:** React with Next.js (This is recommended for its performance, SEO benefits, and ease of routing, which will be useful for the different sections like the whitepaper).\n-   **Styling:** SCSS or TailwindCSS (To be determined based on the styles of the imported `automationsaas` and `report viewer` components).\n-   **Bundler:** Webpack (Handled automatically by Next.js).\n\n## 3. Proposed File Structure\n\nThe project will adhere to a standard Next.js directory structure:\n\n```\n.\n├── src/\n│   ├── app/                # Next.js App Router for pages and layouts\n│   │   ├── (main)/           # Main website routes\n│   │   │   ├── page.tsx      # Homepage\n│   │   │   └── layout.tsx\n│   │   ├── whitepaper/       # Route group for the interactive whitepaper\n│   │   │   ├── page.tsx\n│   │   │   └── layout.tsx\n│   │   └── global.scss     # Global styles\n│   │\n│   ├── components/         # Reusable React components (e.g., Navbar, Footer)\n│   │   └── report-viewer/  # The adapted report viewer component\n│   │\n│   ├── lib/                # Utility functions, helpers\n│   │\n│   └── content/            # Static content, like the markdown/json for the whitepaper\n│\n├── public/                 # Static assets (images, fonts)\n│\n├── package.json            # Project manifest and dependencies\n└── tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration\n```\n\n## 4. Key Architectural Concepts\n\n-   **Separation of Concerns:** The structure separates pages, reusable UI components, and static content.\n-   **Component-Based UI:** The UI will be built by composing small, reusable components. The core components from `automationsaas` (homepage layout) and `aiascent.game` (report viewer) will be adapted and placed in `src/components/`.\n-   **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Next.js will be used to pre-render the homepage and whitepaper pages as static HTML, ensuring fast load times and good SEO.\n-   **Strong Typing:** TypeScript will be used throughout the project to ensure type safety and improve developer experience.\n</file>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-A7-Development-and-Testing-Guide.md\">\n# Artifact A7: aiascent-dev - Development and Testing Guide\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A generic template for a development and testing guide.\n- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **aiascent.dev** website locally.\n\n## 2. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed using npm.\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code and watch for changes, run the following command:\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\nThis will start the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`, and automatically recompile your code when you save a file.\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOpen your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the homepage of the `aiascent.dev` website.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\nYou can use your browser's developer tools to debug the frontend React components. For backend (server-side rendering) debugging in Next.js, you can attach the VS Code debugger by creating a `launch.json` configuration.\n\n## 3. Testing\n\nThe project will be configured with a testing framework (e.g., Jest with React Testing Library). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n</file>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-A9-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\">\n# Artifact A9: aiascent-dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A generic template for a guide on setting up a new project with Git and GitHub, including a sample workflow.\n- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, git, github, version control, workflow\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local project folder (`C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`) into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines the sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2. Prerequisites\n\n*   You have `git` installed on your machine.\n*   You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** Enter `aiascent-dev`.\n4.  **Description:** (Optional) \"Promotional website and interactive whitepaper for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) project.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files, and this will prevent conflicts.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions. We will use the section titled **\"...or push an existing repository from the command line\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory (`C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`). Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files:**\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"Initial commit: Pre-boot with planning artifacts from DCE C117\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\nAfter these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files.\n\n## 4. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work, without losing your place.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean. You can check this with `git status`. All your previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate a Prompt and Get Responses\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Use this prompt to get multiple responses (e.g., 4 to 8) from your preferred AI model.\n\n### Step 3: Paste and Parse\nPaste the responses into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 4: Accept and Test\n1.  Review the responses and find one that looks promising.\n2.  Select that response and use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Now, compile and test the application (`npm run dev`). Does it work? Does it have errors?\n\n### Step 5: The \"Restore\" Loop\nThis is where Git becomes a powerful part of the workflow.\n\n*   **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs, don't work as expected):**\n    1.  Use the **\"Restore Baseline\"** button in the DCE, or run `git restore .` in the terminal.\n    2.  This command instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    3.  You are now back to a clean state and can go back to the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, select a *different* AI response, and click \"Accept Selected Files\" again to test the next proposed solution.\n\n*   **If the changes are good:**\n    1.  Use the **\"Baseline (Commit)\"** button in the DCE, or use the Source Control panel in VS Code.\n    2.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"Feat: Implement homepage header via AI C5\").\n    3.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle from a new, clean state.\n\nThis iterative loop of `accept -> test -> restore` allows you to rapidly audition multiple AI-generated solutions without fear of corrupting your codebase.\n</file>"

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nAs the senior project architect for `aiascent.dev`, I have completed the project initialization (Cycle 0). I analyzed the project scope (M4) and reviewed the available context, including the flattened repositories of related projects (`automationsaas` and `aiascent.game`).\n\nBased on this analysis, I have developed a strategy that leverages these existing assets to accelerate development. The `automationsaas` project will provide the foundational Next.js/TypeScript/TailwindCSS shell, and the `aiascent.game` project will provide the interactive report viewer component, which will be ported and adapted as the primary showcase feature.\n\nI have generated nine foundational artifacts based on the provided templates (M6 Static Context). This includes the mandatory setup guides (A14 GitHub Setup and A7 Development Guide) and core planning documents that reflect the asset reuse strategy (A1 Vision, A2 Requirements, A3 Technical Plan, A11 Roadmap). I also created the necessary process documents (A16 Environment Setup, A4 Task Checklist) and the Master Artifact List (A0).\n\nNo code files were generated, adhering to the Cycle 0 constraints.

Key Architectural Concepts\n\n  - **Asset Reuse:** The primary architectural concept is the reuse of the `automationsaas` shell. This provides a pre-configured environment with styling, theming, and basic layout structures.\n  - **Component Porting:** The core interactive feature (the viewer) will be ported from `aiascent.game` and encapsulated within the `src/components/whitepaper/` directory.\n  - **Next.js App Router:** Utilizing the file-system-based routing and React Server Components capabilities of the Next.js App Router.\n  - **Decoupling and Simplification:** Removing unnecessary dependencies from the `automationsaas` shell (like authentication, billing, and database logic) to create a lean promotional site.\n    \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A11-aiascentdev-Implementation-Roadmap.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A11: aiascentdev - Implementation Roadmap\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A step-by-step roadmap for the implementation of `aiascent.dev`, focusing on the migration of existing assets and the development of the interactive showcase.\n  - **Tags:** roadmap, implementation, planning, strategy, migration, porting\n\n## 1\\. Overview & Goal\n\nThis document provides a clear, step-by-step roadmap for the implementation of **aiascent.dev**. The roadmap prioritizes the migration of the `automationsaas` shell and the porting of the `aiascent.game` viewer component to rapidly achieve the Phase 1 goals.\n\n## 2\\. Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Shell Migration and Cleanup (Est. Cycle 1-2)\n\n  - **Goal:** Establish the project foundation by migrating and cleaning the `automationsaas` shell.\n  - **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Migration:** Copy the core files from `automationsaas` (`package.json`, configs, `src/app`, `src/components/global`, `src/components/ui`, `src/providers`, `src/lib`).\n    2.  **Dependency Cleanup:** Update `package.json` to remove dependencies not needed for `aiascent.dev` (e.g., Prisma, Stripe, Clerk, specific API clients).\n    3.  **Code Cleanup:** Remove authentication, billing, database access, and API route files from the `src` directory.\n    4.  **Rebranding:** Update the site name, logo, and basic styling in the Navbar and layout files.\n    5.  **Validation:** Ensure the cleaned shell builds and runs (`npm install && npm run dev`).\n  - **Outcome:** A clean, rebranded Next.js application shell ready for feature development.\n\n### Step 2: Interactive Whitepaper - Porting and Refactoring (Est. Cycle 3-5)\n\n  - **Goal:** Port the viewer component from `aiascent.game` and adapt it for the new environment.\n  - **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Identification:** Analyze the `ReportViewer` in `aiascent.game` and identify all dependencies (child components, utility functions, data structures).\n    2.  **Porting:** Copy the relevant files into `src/components/whitepaper/`.\n    3.  **Refactoring:** Rename the component to `InteractiveWhitepaper`. Remove game-specific state management and styling. Adapt it to use local state or a new, dedicated store.\n    4.  **Data Integration:** Define the JSON data structure for the whitepaper and implement the logic to load it from `src/data`.\n  - **Outcome:** A functional, standalone interactive viewer component running within the `aiascent.dev` shell.\n\n### Step 3: Content Integration and UI Development (Est. Cycle 6-8)\n\n  - **Goal:** Integrate the actual whitepaper content and build the remaining UI.\n  - **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Content Conversion:** Convert the DCE whitepaper into the required JSON format.\n    2.  **Page Creation:** Create the `/whitepaper` route and integrate the `InteractiveWhitepaper` component.\n    3.  **Landing Page:** Develop the main landing page (`src/app/page.tsx`) with marketing content about the DCE, adapting the existing `automationsaas` landing page design.\n  - **Outcome:** A feature-complete Phase 1 website.\n\n### Step 4: Polish and Deployment (Est. Cycle 9+)\n\n  - **Goal:** Refine the application and deploy it to production.\n  - **Tasks:**\n    1.  **UI/UX Polish:** Address responsiveness issues and fine-tune styling.\n    2.  **Testing:** Conduct thorough cross-browser testing.\n    3.  **Deployment:** Configure the hosting environment and deploy the website.\n  - **Outcome:** A stable, polished, and publicly accessible website.\n    \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A7-aiascentdev-Development-and-Testing-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A7: aiascentdev - Development and Testing Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Standard procedures for running, debugging, and testing the `aiascent.dev` Next.js application locally.\n  - **Tags:** development, testing, debugging, workflow, nextjs, guide\n\n## 1\\. Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **aiascent.dev** application locally.\n\n## 2\\. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed. This project inherits the configuration from `automationsaas`. Navigate to the project root and run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n# or if using yarn (as specified in automationsaas package.json):\n# yarn install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo start the Next.js development server with hot-reloading, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or:\n# yarn dev\n```\n\nThis will compile the code and watch for changes.\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOnce the development server is running, it will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the configuration). Open this URL in your web browser to view the application. Next.js will automatically update the browser when you save changes to the source files.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\nYou can use your browser's built-in Developer Tools (Inspector, Console, Debugger) to debug the client-side React application.\n\nFor debugging server-side code (e.g., React Server Components or API routes), logs will appear in the terminal where you ran the dev command.\n\n## 3\\. Testing\n\nThe project inherits the testing configuration from `automationsaas` (Jest). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n# or:\n# yarn test\n```\n\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n\n## 4\\. Building for Production\n\nTo create an optimized production build of the application, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n# or:\n# yarn build\n```\n\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A14-aiascentdev-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A14: aiascentdev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A step-by-step guide with the necessary git commands to initialize the `aiascent.dev` project repository and link it to GitHub, including the DCE testing workflow.\n  - **Tags:** git, github, version control, setup, repository, workflow, dce\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines a sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n  * You have `git` installed on your machine.\n  * You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev` (or similar).\n4.  **Description:** \"Promotional and educational website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files (the artifacts generated in Cycle 0):**\n\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with project planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your new GitHub repository page.\n\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\n## 4\\. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle (like Cycle 1), ensure your working directory is clean (`git status` should show nothing to commit).\n\n### Step 2: Generate a Prompt and Get Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file based on the task list (A4). Use this prompt to get multiple responses from your preferred AI model.\n\n### Step 3: Paste and Parse\n\nPaste the responses into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 4: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and find one that looks promising.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button to write the AI's proposed changes (e.g., the migration of the `automationsaas` shell) to your workspace.\n3.  Now, try to build and run the application (`npm install`, `npm run dev`). Does it work?\n\n### Step 5: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n  * **If the changes are bad (e.g., the migration was incomplete, the app doesn't build):**\n\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    3.  This command instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit (Cycle 0).\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response in the DCE panel and try again.\n\n  * **If the changes are good:**\n\n    1.  Open the Source Control panel in VS Code.\n    2.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    3.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Migrate and clean automationsaas shell\").\n    4.  Commit the changes.\n    5.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle (Cycle 2).\n        \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A16-aiascentdev-Developer-Environment-Setup-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A16: aiascentdev - Developer Environment Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A guide for setting up the local development environment, including required tools (Node.js, Git, VS Code) and configuration.\n  - **Tags:** environment, setup, tools, configuration, onboarding, guide\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis document provides a step-by-step guide for setting up the local development environment required to build and run **aiascent.dev**.\n\n## 2\\. System Requirements\n\n  - **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux\n  - **Package Manager:** npm (included with Node.js) or yarn\n  - **Node.js Version:** v18.17.0 or later (LTS recommended, e.g., v20.x)\n  - **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code (Recommended)\n\n## 3\\. Required Tools & Software\n\nPlease install the following tools if you do not already have them:\n\n1.  **Node.js:** Download the LTS version from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).\n2.  **Git:** Download from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n3.  **Visual Studio Code:** Download from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n### Recommended VS Code Extensions\n\n  - ESLint\n  - Prettier - Code formatter\n  - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense\n  - Data Curation Environment (DCE)\n\n## 4\\. Step-by-Step Setup Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Clone the Repository\n\nFirst, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.\n\n```bash\n# Replace with your repository URL\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/aiascent-dev.git\ncd aiascent-dev\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install Project Dependencies\n\nNext, install all the necessary project dependencies.\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n# or yarn install\n```\n\n### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (If Applicable)\n\nIf the project requires environment variables, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project. Next.js automatically loads variables from this file.\n\n```bash\n# Example content for .env.local:\n# NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=UA-XXXXX-Y\n```\n\n### Step 4: Run the Development Server\n\nTo start the local development server, run the following command.\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or yarn dev\n```\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Setup\n\nOnce the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the configuration). You should see the `aiascent.dev` landing page.\n\n## 5\\. Managing Environment Variables and Secrets\n\nTo provide an AI assistant with the necessary context about which environment variables are available without exposing sensitive secrets, follow this best practice:\n\n1.  **Use `.env.local` for secrets:** Keep your actual secrets in `.env.local`.\n2.  **Create a `.env.dce` file (or `.env.example`):** Make a copy of your `.env.local` file.\n3.  **Redact Secret Values:** In the copied file, replace all sensitive values with the placeholder `[REDACTED]`.\n4.  **Include in Context:** When using the DCE, select the redacted file (`.env.dce` or `.env.example`) to include it in the prompt context.\n5.  **Exclude Secrets from Git:** Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes `.env.local` (Next.js default) to prevent your actual secrets from being committed to version control.\n    \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A4-aiascentdev-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A4: aiascentdev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, starting with the migration of the `automationsaas` shell.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, process, planning, workflow, migration\n\n## 1\\.

Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Prerequisites\n\nEnsure you have the following installed:\n\n  - Node.js (LTS version recommended)\n  - npm (or yarn/pnpm)\n\n### Step 2: Install Dependencies\n\nNavigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and install all project dependencies.\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Step 3: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code and start the Next.js development server with hot-reloading, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThis will watch for changes in your source files and automatically update the application in the browser.\n\n### Step 4: Running the Application\n\nOnce the development server is running, you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to:\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3000\n```\n\n### Step 5: Debugging\n\nYou can debug the client-side application using your browser's developer tools (Inspector, Console, Debugger). For server-side code (e.g., API routes or Server Components), you can attach a debugger to the Node.js process or use `console.log` statements which will appear in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running.\n\n## 3\\. Testing\n\nThe project will be configured with a testing framework (e.g., Jest or Cypress). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\n\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console. (Note: Testing framework setup is planned for a future cycle).\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A14. aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A14: aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A guide on setting up the aiascent.dev project with Git and GitHub, including a sample workflow for using Git with the DCE.\n  - **Tags:** git, github, version control, workflow, setup, guide\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines a sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n  * You have `git` installed on your machine.\n  * You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev`.\n4.  **Description:** (Optional) \"Promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"C0: Initial project setup and planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\n## 4\\. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean (check with `git status`). All previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate and Parse Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Get multiple responses from your AI model, paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 3: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and select a promising one.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Compile and test the application (e.g., `npm run dev`). Does it work? Does it have errors?\n\n### Step 4: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\nThis is where Git integrates seamlessly with the workflow.\n\n  * **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs):**\n\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    3.  This command instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response in the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and test the next solution.\n\n  * **If the changes are good:**\n\n    1.  Open the Source Control panel in VS Code.\n    2.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    3.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding\").\n    4.  Commit the changes.\n    5.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle.\n\nThis iterative loop of `accept -> test -> restore` allows you to rapidly audition multiple AI-generated solutions without fear of corrupting your codebase.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A17. aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A17: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1\\.

Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Foundational Setup & Scaffolding (Cycle 1)\n\n\\-   **Goal:** Create the basic project structure and initialize the development environment.\n\\-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Initialize Project:** Set up the Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS (A3).\n    2.  **Version Control:** Initialize the Git repository and push to GitHub (A14).\n    3.  **Basic Layout:** Implement the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) with placeholder Header and Footer components.\n\\-   **Outcome:** A runnable Next.js application with the core technical structure in place.\n\n### Step 2: Landing Page UI Development (Cycle 2-3)\n\n\\-   **Goal:** Build the main landing page UI and core navigation.\n\\-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Header & Footer:** Implement the functional Header and Footer components.\n    2.  **Hero Section:** Create the main hero section with the headline and primary CTA.\n    3.  **Features Section:** Implement the section detailing the key benefits of the DCE.\n    4.  **Styling & Responsiveness:** Apply the visual design using TailwindCSS and ensure responsiveness.\n\\-   **Outcome:** A visually complete and responsive landing page.\n\n### Step 3: Interactive Showcase Implementation (Cycle 4-6)\n\n\\-   **Goal:** Develop the core feature of Phase 1: the interactive showcase component.\n\\-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Data Structure:** Define and create the JSON data source (`src/data/whitepaperContent.json`).\n    2.  **Showcase Page:** Create the `/showcase` page route.\n    3.  **Component Development:** Build the `InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx` component, including data loading and navigation logic.\n    4.  **Integration:** Integrate the component into the showcase page with accompanying explanatory text.\n\\-   **Outcome:** A functional interactive showcase that demonstrates the DCE's capabilities.\n\n### Step 4: Polish, Testing, and Deployment (Cycle 7+)\n\n\\-   **Goal:** Finalize the content, fix bugs, and deploy the website.\n\\-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Content Finalization:** Review and finalize all text content and imagery.\n    2.  **Cross-Browser/Device Testing:** Ensure the website works correctly across major browsers and devices.\n    3.  **SEO Optimization:** Implement basic SEO metadata.\n    4.  **Deployment:** Configure the hosting environment and deploy the application.\n\\-   **Outcome:** The Phase 1 website is live and accessible to the public.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A7-Development-and-Testing-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A7: aiascent.dev - Development and Testing Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A guide providing the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the aiascent.dev Next.js website locally.\n  - **Tags:** documentation, project setup, development, testing, nextjs, workflow\n\n## 1\\. Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **aiascent.dev** application locally.\n\n## 2\\. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed. Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n# or if using yarn\n# yarn install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code and start the Next.js development server with hot-reloading, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOnce the development server is running, it will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your web browser to view the application. The server will automatically refresh the page when you save changes to the source files.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\nDebugging is primarily done using the browser's developer tools (DevTools).\n\n  - **Client-Side Debugging:** Open DevTools (F12 or right-click -\\> Inspect) and navigate to the \"Console\" tab for logs or the \"Sources\" (Chrome/Edge) / \"Debugger\" (Firefox) tab to set breakpoints directly in the TypeScript source code (thanks to source maps).\n  - **React State:** Install the React Developer Tools browser extension to inspect component state and props.\n\n## 3\\. Testing\n\nThe project will be configured with a testing framework (e.g., Jest and React Testing Library) as development progresses. To run the test suite, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\n\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n\n## 4\\. Building for Production\n\nTo create an optimized production build of the application, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis generates the necessary files for deployment. You can then run the production build locally using:\n\n```bash\nnpm run start\n```\n\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A14-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A14: aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A guide on setting up the aiascent.dev project with Git and GitHub, including the essential workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n  - **Tags:** git, github, version control, workflow, setup, dce\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines the standard workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n\\*   You have `git` installed on your machine.\n\\*   You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev` (or similar).\n4.  **Description:** \"Promotional and educational website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n    ` bash     git init      `\n\n2.  **Create/Update `.gitignore`:** Ensure you have a `.gitignore` file. Crucially, it must include `.vscode/` to prevent DCE state files from causing issues, along with standard Next.js ignores. You can create a basic one with:\n    ```bash\n    echo \"node_modules/\\n.next/\\n.env.local\\n.vscode/\" > .gitignore\n    ```\n\n3.  **Add all existing files:**\n    ` bash     git add .      `\n\n4.  **Create the first commit:**\n    ` bash     git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with project artifacts\"      `\n\n5.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n    ` bash     git branch -M main      `\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n    ` bash     git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git      `\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n    ` bash     git push -u origin main      `\n\n## 4\\. Standard Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is essential for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean (`git status`). All previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate and Parse Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Get multiple responses from your AI model, paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 3: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and select one that looks promising.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button (or the integrated \"Baseline\" feature if available) to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Compile and test the website (`npm run dev`). Does it work? Are there errors?\n\n### Step 4: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n\\*   **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs):**\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    3.  This instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response in the DCE panel and test the next solution.\n\n\\*   **If the changes are good:**\n    1.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    2.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding\").\n    3.  Commit the changes (`git commit -m \"...\"`).\n    4.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A4: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1\\.

Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files:** (Ensure you have a proper `.gitignore` file first, which will be created in Cycle 1)\n\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with project planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\nAfter these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files.\n\n## 4\\. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is crucial for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean (`git status`). All your previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate a Prompt and Get Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Use this prompt to get multiple responses from your AI model.\n\n### Step 3: Paste and Parse\n\nPaste the responses into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 4: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and select one that looks promising.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button (or the integrated \"Baseline & Accept\" feature if available in your DCE version) to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Now, compile and test the application (`npm run dev`). Does the website look correct? Does the new feature work?\n\n### Step 5: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n  * **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs, break the layout):**\n\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .` (or use the DCE's integrated \"Restore Baseline\" button).\n    3.  This instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response in the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and test the next proposed solution.\n\n  * **If the changes are good:**\n\n    1.  Open the Source Control panel in VS Code.\n    2.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    3.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding\").\n    4.  Commit the changes.\n    5.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle from a new, clean state.\n        \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-A17-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A17: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, bugs, and progress for the aiascent.dev website, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1\\.

Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **aiascent.dev** application locally, based on the Next.js framework inherited from the `automationsaas` shell.\n\n## 2\\. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed. Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run the appropriate command based on the package manager used in the `automationsaas` shell (check `package.json` or look for lock files).\n\n```bash\n# If using npm\nnpm install\n\n# If using yarn (common in automationsaas)\n# yarn install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code, watch for changes, and enable Fast Refresh (hot-reloading), run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or\n# yarn dev\n```\n\nThis will start the Next.js development server.\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOnce the development server is running, the application will typically be available at:\n`http://localhost:3000`\n\nOpen this URL in your web browser. The browser will automatically update when you make changes to the source code.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\n  - **Client-Side Debugging:** Use your browser's Developer Tools (DevTools) to inspect components, monitor network requests, and view console logs.\n  - **Server-Side Debugging:** Logs from server-side rendering or API routes will appear directly in the terminal where the dev server is running.\n\n## 3\\. Testing\n\nThe project inherits the testing configuration from the `automationsaas` shell (likely Jest). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n# or\n# yarn test\n```\n\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent.dev-A14-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A14: aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A step-by-step guide with the necessary git commands to initialize the aiascent.dev project repository and establish the standard DCE testing workflow.\n  - **Tags:** git, github, version control, setup, repository, workflow, dce\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to GitHub, and outlines the standard workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n  * You have `git` installed on your machine.\n  * You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  Click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev`.\n4.  **Description:** \"Promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing the files generated in Cycle 0 and the `automationsaas` shell.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Ensure `.gitignore` is correct:** The `.gitignore` file should be inherited from the `automationsaas` shell in Cycle 1. It is crucial that it includes `.vscode/` to prevent the DCE extension's state files from being committed.\n\n3.  **Add all existing files:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n4.  **Create the first commit:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with project planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n5.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your new GitHub repository page.\n\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\n## 4\\. Standard Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is essential for the DCE workflow, enabling rapid testing and clean reversions of AI-generated code.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle (e.g., Cycle 1), ensure your working directory is clean (check with `git status`).\n\n### Step 2: Generate and Parse Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate `prompt.md`. Get multiple AI responses, paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, and \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 3: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Select the most promising response.\n2.  Use **\"Accept Selected Files\"** (or the \"Baseline/Accept\" flow if implemented in your DCE version) to write the changes to your workspace.\n3.  Run the application (e.g., `npm run dev`) and test the changes.\n\n### Step 4: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n  * **If the changes are bad (e.g., bugs, undesired outcome):**\n\n    1.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    2.  This instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting to the last commit.\n    3.  You are now clean and can select a *different* AI response in the Panel and try again.\n\n  * **If the changes are good:**\n\n    1.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    2.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding from automationsaas\").\n    3.  Commit the changes.\n    4.  You are now ready for the next development cycle.\n        \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent.dev-A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n## 1\\.

Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines a sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n\\*   You have `git` installed on your machine.\n\\*   You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev`.\n4.  **Description:** (Optional) \"Promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n    ` bash     git init      `\n\n2.  **Add a .gitignore (Important for Next.js and DCE):**\n    Ensure a `.gitignore` file exists in the root directory (Next.js usually creates one). Crucially, ensure it ignores `.vscode/` to prevent DCE state files from causing issues.\n    ```\n    # Example entries:\n    node_modules\n    .next/\n    .env.local\n    # DCE History (Crucial)\n    .vscode/\n    ```\n\n3.  **Add all existing files:**\n    ` bash     git add .      `\n\n4.  **Create the first commit:**\n    ` bash     git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with documentation artifacts\"      `\n\n5.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n    ` bash     git branch -M main      `\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n    ` bash     git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git      `\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n    ` bash     git push -u origin main      `\n\n## 4\\. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean (`git status`). All your previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate and Parse Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Get multiple responses from your AI model, paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 3: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and select one that looks promising.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Compile and test the application (`npm run dev`). Does it work? Does it have errors?\n\n### Step 4: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n\\*   **If the changes are bad:**\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    3.  This instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response to test.\n\n\\*   **If the changes are good:**\n    1.  Stage the changes: `git add .`\n    2.  Commit the changes: `git commit -m \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding\"`\n    3.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent.dev-A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A4: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** The primary task tracking document for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity for efficient workflow management.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1\\.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis is Cycle 1, dedicated to the initial scaffolding of the `aiascent.dev` project as detailed in A3 (Technical Scaffolding Plan) and A4 (Task Checklist T-1).\n\nI have generated the complete foundational structure for a modern Next.js application using the App Router, configured with TypeScript and TailwindCSS. Furthermore, I have integrated the Shadcn/ui component library, as suggested optionally in A3, to provide a robust foundation for rapid UI development.\n\nThis includes all necessary configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `components.json`, etc.), core utility files (`src/lib/utils.ts`), the theme provider setup (`src/providers/theme-provider.tsx`), and the initial application layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`). I also generated the base UI components required for the layout (`Button.tsx`, `DropdownMenu.tsx`) and the `ModeToggle.tsx` component, along with placeholder Header, Footer, and Showcase components/data as defined in A3.\n\nThe project is now initialized and ready for dependency installation and local execution.\n\n**Files Updated/Created:**\n\n  * .gitignore\n  * components.json\n  * next.config.mjs\n  * package.json\n  * postcss.config.mjs\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/globals.css\n  * src/app/layout.tsx\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/app/showcase/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/mode-toggle.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n  * src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/button.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx\n  * src/data/whitepaperContent.json\n  * src/lib/utils.ts\n  * src/providers/theme-provider.tsx\n  * tailwind.config.ts\n  * tsconfig.json\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Create `package.json`:** Define project metadata and dependencies for Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn/ui related libraries.\n2.  **Create Configuration Files:** Generate `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `next.config.mjs`, and `components.json`.\n3.  **Create `.gitignore`:** Ensure standard Next.js and DCE directories (`.vscode/`) are ignored.\n4.  **Create Utility Files:** Generate `src/lib/utils.ts` (for `cn` helper) and `src/providers/theme-provider.tsx`.\n5.  **Create Core Application Files:** Implement `src/app/globals.css`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, and a placeholder `src/app/page.tsx`.\n6.  **Create Base UI Components:** Generate `src/components/ui/button.tsx` and `src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx` (required for ModeToggle).\n7.  **Create Layout Components:** Generate `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`, and `src/components/global/mode-toggle.tsx`.\n8.  **Create Showcase Placeholders:** Generate `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` and `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`.\n9.  **Create Data Placeholder:** Generate `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`.\n10. **Update A4 Checklist:** Mark Task T-1 (Project Scaffolding) as completed.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\n\n1.  **Install Dependencies:** Please run `npm install` (or `yarn install`/`pnpm install`) in the project root directory after accepting these files to install the dependencies defined in `package.json`.\n2.  **Start Development Server:** Run `npm run dev` to verify the initial setup.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis is Cycle 1, dedicated to initializing the `aiascent.dev` project scaffolding as outlined in the Technical Scaffolding Plan (A3) and Task T-1 of the Universal Task Checklist (A4). The objective is to establish a robust, modern foundation using Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, incorporating the structure for the shadcn/ui component library from the outset.\n\nI have generated the complete foundational setup by creating all necessary configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, etc.), utility files (`src/lib/utils.ts`), and providers (`ThemeProvider`). I utilized configuration patterns observed in the `automationsaas` context (M7) as a reference for best practices in this technology stack.\n\nThe core application structure is established, including the root layout, global styles, and the initial landing page. Placeholder components for the Header and Footer have been created, integrating a functional theme toggle (ModeToggle).\n\nFurthermore, the scaffolding for the Interactive Showcase feature has been created according to A3. This includes the data placeholder (`src/data/whitepaperContent.json`), the showcase page (`src/app/showcase/page.tsx`), and the interactive component (`src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`). The data loading strategy is implemented correctly: the JSON is imported in the server component (`showcase/page.tsx`) and passed as a prop to the client component (`InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`).\n\nFinally, I updated the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to mark T-1 as complete and provided instructions for the curator to initialize the project.\n\n**Files Created/Updated:**\n\n  * .eslintrc.json\n  * .gitignore\n  * components.json\n  * next.config.mjs\n  * next-env.d.ts\n  * package.json\n  * postcss.config.mjs\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/globals.css\n  * src/app/layout.tsx\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/app/showcase/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/mode-toggle.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n  * src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/button.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx\n  * src/data/whitepaperContent.json\n  * src/lib/utils.ts\n  * src/providers/theme-provider.tsx\n  * tailwind.config.ts\n  * tsconfig.json\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Generate Configuration Files:** Create `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `next.config.mjs`, `.gitignore`, `components.json`, `.eslintrc.json`, and `next-env.d.ts`.\n2.  **Generate Utility Files:** Create `src/lib/utils.ts` (for `cn` helper).\n3.  **Generate Providers and Theming:** Create `src/providers/theme-provider.tsx` and `src/components/global/mode-toggle.tsx`.\n4.  **Generate Core Application Structure:** Create `src/app/globals.css`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, and `src/app/page.tsx`.\n5.  **Generate Layout Components:** Create `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` and `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`.\n6.  **Generate Showcase Structure:** Create `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`, `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`, and `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`. Implement the data loading strategy (import in server component, pass to client component).\n7.  **Generate Basic UI Components:** Create necessary shadcn/ui components (`Button.tsx`, `DropdownMenu.tsx`).\n8.  **Update A4 Checklist:** Mark Task T-1 as complete and prepare for T-2.\n9.  **Provide Curator Instructions:** Outline steps to install dependencies and run the project.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\nAfter accepting these files, please perform the following actions in your terminal at the project root (`C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`):\n\n1.  **Install Dependencies:**\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n    *(Note: If you prefer using yarn, as indicated in the `packageManager` field of `package.json`, you can run `yarn install` instead.)*\n\n2.  **Initialize Git and Commit:** (As detailed in A14, the `.gitignore` file is included in this response)\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    git add .\n    git commit -m \"C1: Initialize Next.js project scaffolding and structure\"\n    git branch -M main\n    # Add your remote and push if ready (see A14 for details)\n    ```\n\n3.  **Start the Development Server:**\n\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n\n4.  **Verify:** Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to ensure the basic application is running.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nCycle 1: Project Initialization and Scaffolding.\n\nThe objective of this cycle is to initialize the `aiascent.dev` project by creating the foundational scaffolding as outlined in the Technical Scaffolding Plan (A3) and Task T-1 of the Universal Task Checklist (A4).\n\nI have generated the core configuration files required for a modern Next.js application utilizing the App Router, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. This includes:\n\n  - `package.json` with necessary dependencies (including common utilities like `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `tailwindcss-animate`, and `lucide-react`).\n  - `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration.\n  - TailwindCSS setup files (`tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`).\n  - `next.config.mjs` for Next.js configuration.\n  - A comprehensive `.gitignore` file, including the crucial `.vscode/` ignore for DCE compatibility.\n\nFurthermore, I established the initial application structure: the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`), the global stylesheet (`src/app/globals.css`) with standard CSS variables for theming, and a placeholder home page (`src/app/page.tsx`). I also included `src/lib/utils.ts` (for the `cn` helper).\n\nTo establish the planned architecture (A3), I generated functional placeholder files for the layout components (`Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`), the showcase page (`src/app/showcase/page.tsx`), the interactive component (`InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`), and the data source (`src/data/whitepaperContent.json`).\n\nFinally, I updated the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to reflect the completion of T-1.\n\nThe project is now scaffolded and ready for the curator to install dependencies and begin development.\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Create `package.json`**: Define project metadata and dependencies for Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and common utilities.\n2.  **Create `tsconfig.json`**: Set up TypeScript configuration suitable for Next.js.\n3.  **Create `tailwind.config.ts`**: Initialize the TailwindCSS configuration using a standard structure compatible with modern practices (like shadcn/ui).\n4.  **Create `postcss.config.mjs`**: Configuration file required for TailwindCSS processing.\n5.  **Create `next.config.mjs`**: Basic Next.js configuration file.\n6.  **Create `.gitignore`**: Define files and directories to be ignored by Git, including Next.js defaults and DCE specifics (`.vscode/`).\n7.  **Create `src/lib/utils.ts`**: Create the `cn` utility function for Tailwind class merging.\n8.  **Create `src/app/globals.css`**: Global stylesheet containing Tailwind directives and CSS variables for theming.\n9.  **Create `src/app/layout.tsx`**: The root layout for the application using the App Router, integrating Header and Footer.\n10. **Create `src/app/page.tsx`**: The main landing page (placeholder content).\n11. **Create Placeholder Structure Files**: Generate functional placeholders for `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`, `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`.\n12. **Create Placeholder Data**: Generate `src/data/whitepaperContent.json` with sample data.\n13. **Update `A4.

Purpose & Vision\n\nThe Showcase page serves as the \"proof\" for the claims made on the Home page. Its sole purpose is to present a complex, high-quality, interactive component that was itself built using the Data Curation Environment (DCE). This creates a powerful, self-referential demonstration of the tool's power. The page should be clean and focused, putting the showcase component front and center.\n\n## 2. Page Structure & Components\n\n### 2.1. Page Header\n\n*   **Headline:** \"The Proof is the Product\"\n*   **Sub-headline:** \"This interactive report viewer is a complex, data-driven component built from the ground up using the DCE. It demonstrates how the tool facilitates the creation of sophisticated, multi-file features through a structured, iterative workflow.\"\n\n### 2.2. The Showcase Component Container\n\n*   **Component:** `<InteractiveWhitepaper />`\n*   **Layout:** The component will be housed within a clean container, styled to look like a modern application window or a sophisticated presentation view. It should have a subtle border and box-shadow to lift it off the page.\n*   **Data Source:** The component will be fed data from `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`. Initially, this can be the placeholder content, but it will eventually be populated with content from \"The Ascent Report\" (from the `aiascent.game` context).\n\n### 2.3. \"How It Was Built\" Section\n\n*   **Headline:** \"Behind the Curtain: The DCE Workflow\"\n*   **Content:** A brief, step-by-step narrative explaining how a feature like this is built using the DCE. This makes the development process tangible for the user.\n    1.  **Step 1: Documentation First:** \"We started by creating blueprint artifacts (like this one) to define the vision, architecture, and data model.\"\n    2.  **Step 2: Context Curation:** \"Using the DCE's File Tree View, we selected all relevant files—React components, state management stores, and data schemas—to create a precise context for our AI.\"\n    3.  **Step 3: Iterative Generation:** \"We prompted the AI to generate the code, file by file. We used the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel to compare different AI approaches for the navigation logic, selecting the most efficient one.\"\n    4.  **Step 4: Test & Refine:** \"After accepting the AI's code, we tested it. When a bug was found, we used `git restore .` to revert, curated a more specific context, refined the prompt, and generated a better solution in the next cycle.\"\n*   **Visual Element (Optional but effective):** A simplified, animated diagram or a short video/GIF showing the DCE UI in action (the FTV selection -> PCPP response -> code appearing in the editor).\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A18. aiascent.dev - Vision Page Blueprint.md\">\n# Artifact A18: aiascent.dev - Vision Page Blueprint\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A blueprint for the Vision page, a narrative-driven section of the site dedicated to the \"Why\" behind the DCE and the \"Citizen Architect\" concept.\n- **Tags:** blueprint, planning, vision, philosophy, citizen architect\n\n## 1. Purpose & Vision\n\nThis page is the heart of the website's mission. It moves beyond the technical features of the DCE to explain the philosophy and aiascent's long-term vision. The goal is to inspire and resonate with developers who are not just looking for a better tool, but for a more meaningful way to engage with their craft in the age of AI. It directly addresses the user's goal of cultivating 'sleeper citizen agents/architects'.\n\nThe tone should be thoughtful, inspiring, and slightly provocative.\n\n## 2. Page Structure & Narrative Flow\n\nThis page will be structured as a long-form narrative, broken into clear sections with compelling headlines.\n\n### 2.1. Section 1: The Fork in the Road\n\n*   **Headline:** \"AI Presents a Choice: Become a Ghost in the Machine, or its Architect.\"\n*   **Content:**\n    *   Start by acknowledging the anxiety and uncertainty many developers feel about AI. Frame the current moment as a critical choice.\n    *   **Path 1: The Ghost Worker.** Describe the dystopian path where developers become low-paid \"human API endpoints,\" mindlessly fixing the output of a black-box AI, their skills devalued and their agency gone. This connects to the \"Fissured Workplace\" concept.\n    *   **Path 2: The Citizen Architect.** Introduce the alternative: a future where AI handles the drudgery, freeing human intellect to focus on what matters—creativity, strategy, and architecture. This is the path of empowerment.\n\n### 2.2. Section 2: The 100x Multiplier is Real\n\n*   **Headline:** \"This Isn't About Working 10% Faster. It's About Building 100x Bigger.\"\n*   **Content:**\n    *   Argue that the true revolution of AI isn't incremental productivity gains. It's a paradigm shift in the scale of what a single person can create.\n    *   Define the \"Citizen Architect\" as the individual who has mastered this new paradigm. They don't just write code; they orchestrate systems. They are the solo creators who can now build what once required a venture-funded startup.\n    *   Use `aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev` as the primary evidence. \"A single developer built a real-time multiplayer game and this website. That isn't a boast; it's a signal of a new reality.\"\n\n### 2.3. Section 3: The Tool for Architects\n\n*   **Headline:** \"You Can't Build a Skyscraper with a Screwdriver.\"\n*   **Content:**\n    *   Argue that standard AI chat interfaces are insufficient for this new paradigm. They are conversational, not architectural.\n    *   Introduce the DCE as the tool purpose-built for the Citizen Architect. Explain how its core features (Context Curation, Parallel Co-Pilot, Iterative Workflow) are designed to support a structured, systems-level approach to AI development.\n    *   Frame the DCE not as a replacement for the developer, but as a \"cognitive exoskeleton\"—a tool that amplifies their architectural vision.\n\n### 2.4. Section 4: A Call to Action\n\n*   **Headline:** \"The Future is Unwritten. It's Time to Build.\"\n*   **Content:**\n    *   End with a direct and inspiring call to action. This is where the 'cognitive capitalist' and 'sleeper agent' themes are made explicit, but framed positively.\n    *   \"The power to build the future is being decentralized. An army of individual creators, of cognitive capitalists, can out-innovate any top-down, centralized system. This is the American counter-strategy in the global AI race—a bet on the distributed genius of free people.\"\n    *   \"Download the DCE. Start a project. Master the workflow. Become an architect of your own ascent.\"\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A19. aiascent.dev - Documentation Hub Blueprint.md\">\n# Artifact A19: aiascent.dev - Documentation Hub Blueprint\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A blueprint for the Documentation Hub, which will serve as the central repository for tutorials, guides, and educational content for the DCE.\n- **Tags:** blueprint, planning, documentation, tutorials, guides\n\n## 1. Purpose & Vision\n\nThe Documentation Hub is a critical component for fostering adoption and teaching the \"citizen architect\" methodology. It will be the go-to resource for users to learn how to install, use, and master the Data Curation Environment (DCE). The content should be clear, practical, and organized, guiding users from basic setup to advanced workflows.\n\nThis hub will evolve over time, but this blueprint establishes the foundational structure.\n\n## 2.

Purpose & Goal\n\nThe Showcase page serves as the tangible **proof** of the claims made on the homepage. Its primary goal is to host the `InteractiveWhitepaper` component, demonstrating a complex, data-driven application that was itself built using the Data Curation Environment (DCE). The page must frame this component correctly, explaining to the user what they are seeing and why it is significant.\n\n## 2. Page Structure & Content\n\nThe page will have a simple, clean layout that focuses the user's attention on the interactive component itself.\n\n### Section 1: Page Header\n\n*   **Component:** Standard page header section.\n*   **Headline (H1):** `Interactive Showcase: The Ascent Report`\n*   **Sub-headline:** `This interactive report viewer is a real, functional component built entirely with the Data Curation Environment. It demonstrates how a single developer—a \"Citizen Architect\"—can use the DCE to build complex, data-driven applications by collaborating with an AI.`\n\n### Section 2: The Interactive Component\n\n*   **Component:** A large, bordered container that prominently features the `<InteractiveWhitepaper />` component.\n*   **Implementation:** The `showcase/page.tsx` will import the component and the static JSON data (`whitepaperContent.json`), passing the data as a prop. This leverages Next.js Server Components for efficient data loading.\n*   **Content:** The `InteractiveWhitepaper` component will render the content from the JSON file, allowing users to navigate through pages and sections as defined in its own logic.\n\n### Section 3: Explanatory \"How it Was Built\" Section\n\n*   **Component:** A two-column section placed directly below the interactive component container.\n*   **Purpose:** To connect the showcase back to the DCE product.\n*   **Left Column (Text):**\n    *   **Headline (H2):** `From a Vibe to a Component`\n    *   **Body:** Briefly explain the development process.\n        1.  **Phase 1: Vision (Documentation):** \"The process began by creating blueprint artifacts (like this one!) that defined the vision, features, and data structure for the component.\"\n        2.  **Phase 2: Collaboration (AI Prompting):** \"Using the DCE, these blueprints were combined with existing code to create a rich context for an AI. The AI was then prompted to generate the React components, state management logic, and data-loading mechanisms.\"\n        3.  **Phase 3: Curation (Test & Iterate):** \"Multiple AI responses were parsed, compared, and tested in parallel using the PCPP. The best solutions were accepted, and the `git restore` workflow was used to quickly discard failing approaches, leading to rapid, iterative progress.\"\n*   **Right Column (Visual):**\n    *   A simplified visual of the DCE workflow loop: `Artifacts -> DCE Context -> AI -> PCPP -> Final Code`.\n\n### Section 4: Final Call to Action\n\n*   **Component:** A simple, centered CTA section.\n*   **Headline (H2):** `Ready to Build Your Own Showcase?`\n*   **CTA Button:** `Get Started on GitHub`.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A22-Tutorials-Page-Blueprint.md\">\n# Artifact A22: aiascent.dev - Tutorials Page Blueprint\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A placeholder blueprint for the future \"Tutorials\" section of the aiascent.dev website, aligning with Phase 2 of the project roadmap.\n- **Tags:** tutorials, documentation, blueprint, design, phase 2, roadmap\n\n## 1.

Content Strategy\n\n### 3.1. The Philosophy (The Citizen Architect)\n\n  * Introduce the core problem: AI is powerful, but current interfaces (like standard chat) are unstructured, leading to inefficiency, lack of reproducibility, and wasted potential.\n  * Introduce the solution: The DCE provides the necessary structure to turn AI interaction into an engineering discipline.\n  * Emphasize the strategic goal: To empower a wave of \"Citizen Architects\"—developers capable of leveraging AI to build and maintain complex systems, thereby increasing national \"Cognitive Capital\" and countering adversarial AI strategies (e.g., China's centralized approach).\n\n### 3.2. The Methodology\n\n  * Focus on the \"Documentation First\" approach.\n  * Explain what an \"Artifact\" is in the DCE context (a \"Source of Truth\" document).\n  * Explain why this approach is superior for large projects: clarity, consistency, and shared understanding between human and AI collaborators.\n\n### 3.3. The Workflow\n\n  * Use the Workflow Diagram (DIAG-01) as the centerpiece.\n  * Provide a narrative description of each step in the \"perfect loop,\" emphasizing the benefits at each stage (e.g., precision in curation, rapid testing in the restore loop).\n\n### 3.4. Key Features\n\n  * Provide detailed explanations of the main UI components of the extension.\n  * Use focused screenshots (IMG-03, IMG-04) to illustrate each feature.\n  * Explain the benefit of each feature (e.g., FTV ensures precise context; PCPP enables parallel exploration and risk mitigation).\n\n## 4\\. Next Steps (Implementation - Future Cycle)\n\n1.  **Create Page Route:** Create `src/app/about-dce/page.tsx`.\n2.  **Content Drafting:** Begin drafting the content for each section based on the strategy above.\n3.  **Asset Integration:** Integrate the required diagrams and screenshots as they become available (see A15).\n    \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A19-Page-Design-Tutorials-Blog.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A19: aiascent.dev - Page Design - Tutorials and Blog\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Design blueprint for the Tutorials and Blog section, outlining the structure for educational content delivery.\n  - **Tags:** design, tutorials, blog, education, content marketing, mdx\n\n## 1\\. Page Overview and Goals\n\nThe Tutorials and Blog section (Phase 2 goal) is crucial for user adoption and education. It will host articles, guides, and development updates related to the Data Curation Environment (DCE). The goal is to teach the DCE methodology, provide practical examples, and foster a community around the tool.\n\n**Key Message:** Master the DCE workflow and become a more effective Citizen Architect.\n\n## 2\\. Technical Approach (Future State)\n\nWhile the initial implementation might use static React components, the long-term plan is to leverage MDX (Markdown + JSX) for content creation. This allows for rich, interactive content embedded within easily editable Markdown files.\n\n  * **Content Management:** Articles will be stored as `.mdx` files.\n  * **Rendering:** Next.js provides excellent support for MDX, allowing us to render these files as pages with custom layouts.\n\n## 3\\. Layout and Structure\n\nThe section will have two main views: the Index/Listing view and the Article/Detail view.\n\n### 3.1.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThe project is successfully initialized and built. In Cycle 2, we are focusing on detailed planning, asset management, and initiating the implementation of the homepage design based on the provided context.\n\nI have created a new artifact, **A15 (Asset Wishlist)**, detailing the necessary images for the website, prioritizing the DCE interface screenshot for the hero section. To facilitate asset placement, I have created placeholder files (text files with `.png` extensions for visibility) to establish the `public/images/` directory structure.\n\nNext, I have created a comprehensive blueprint for the website by generating dedicated design artifacts for the key pages:\n\n  - **A16 (Homepage Design):** Focusing on a compelling hero section using the `ContainerScroll` animation (inspired by the `automationsaas` template) to showcase the DCE interface, and clear messaging about empowerment and the \"Citizen Architect\" concept.\n  - **A17 (Showcase Design):** Planning the structure and goals for the Interactive Whitepaper demonstration.\n  - **A18 (Tutorials Design):** Planning the structure for future educational content.\n  - **A19 (Mission Design):** Articulating the strategic vision of fostering \"Citizen Architects\" to ensure technological resilience and innovation.\n\nI have updated the **A0 (Master Artifact List)** to include these new planning documents.\n\nFinally, to begin implementing the vision in A16, I have ported the necessary component (`ContainerScroll`) and configuration from the `automationsaas` template. I updated `tailwind.config.ts` with the required keyframes/animations and modified `src/app/page.tsx` to use the `ContainerScroll` component, replacing the placeholder hero section with the new animated design. This leverages existing context to accelerate development and provides a visually engaging landing page structure.\n\n**Files Updated:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Homepage.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A17-Page-Design-Showcase.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A18-Page-Design-Tutorials.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A19-Page-Design-Mission.md (New)\n  * public/images/logo.png (New Placeholder)\n  * public/images/dce-hero-screenshot.png (New Placeholder)\n  * public/images/workflow-diagram.png (New Placeholder)\n  * src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx (New - Ported)\n  * tailwind.config.ts\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Create A15 (Asset Wishlist):** Generate the new artifact detailing required assets and the public directory structure.\n2.  **Create Placeholder Assets:** Generate placeholder files in `public/images/` to establish the directory structure for the curator.\n3.  **Create A16 (Homepage Design):** Generate the design artifact for the landing page, focusing on the hero section (using `ContainerScroll`) and strategic messaging (\"Citizen Architect\").\n4.  **Create A17 (Showcase Design):** Generate the design artifact for the interactive showcase page.\n5.  **Create A18 (Tutorials Design):** Generate the design artifact for the tutorials/guides section (Phase 2 planning).\n6.  **Create A19 (Mission Design):** Generate the design artifact for the About/Mission page, focusing on the strategic goals.\n7.  **Update A0 (Master Artifact List):** Add the new artifacts (A15-A19) to the master list.\n8.  **Port `ContainerScroll` Component:** Copy `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx` from the `automationsaas` context into the project.\n9.  **Update Tailwind Configuration:** Merge the necessary keyframes and animations from the `automationsaas` `tailwind.config.ts` into the project's `tailwind.config.ts` to support the ported component.\n10. **Implement Homepage Hero (A16):** Update `src/app/page.tsx` to utilize the newly ported `ContainerScroll` component for the hero section, aligning with the design in A16.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15: aiascent.dev - Asset Wishlist\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A prioritized list of required visual assets (images, logos, diagrams) for the aiascent.dev website, including the planned directory structure.\n  - **Tags:** assets, wishlist, images, design, planning, public directory\n\n## 1\\.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nIn Cycle 2, I focused on comprehensive planning and establishing the design foundation for `aiascent.dev`, addressing all the user's requests.\n\nI created **A15 (Asset Wishlist and Aesthetics)** to define the visual direction—a professional, \"Empowered Developer\" look—and catalog the required assets, including the critical DCE screenshot. I also established the necessary `public/images/` directory structure with placeholder files, ready for the curator to drop in the actual assets.\n\nNext, I thoroughly planned the website structure. I created **A16 (Site Map and Navigation)** to define the core routes. Following this, I generated detailed blueprints for each page:\n\n  - **A17 (Home):** Focusing on the value proposition and the main hero visual.\n  - **A18 (Showcase):** Centered around the interactive demonstration.\n  - **A19 (Tutorials):** Planning the educational hub (Phase 2).\n  - **A20 (About/Mission):** Dedicated to the strategic \"Citizen Architect\" vision.\n\nI updated **A0 (Master Artifact List)** to include these new planning documents.\n\nFinally, I updated **A4 (Task Checklist)**. The planning and asset tasks (T-5, T-6) are marked complete. The implementation tasks for the next cycle (T-2) have been refined and expanded to include the creation of the new pages (`/about`, `/tutorials`) and the implementation of the homepage based on the new blueprints.\n\nThe project is now thoroughly documented and ready for the main UI implementation phase.\n\n**Files Updated:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist-and-Aesthetics.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Site-Map-and-Navigation.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A17-Page-Blueprint-Home.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A18-Page-Blueprint-Showcase.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A19-Page-Blueprint-Tutorials.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A20-Page-Blueprint-About-Mission.md\n  * public/images/logo.svg\n  * public/images/dce-in-action.png\n  * public/images/icons/placeholder.txt\n  * public/images/showcase/placeholder.txt\n  * public/favicon.ico\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Create A15 (Asset Wishlist & Aesthetics):** Define the required visual assets for the website and establish the overall design language, ensuring it aligns with the professional nature of the DCE and the empowering theme of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n2.  **Establish Directory Structure:** Create placeholder files within the `public/images/` directory to define the necessary structure for storing assets.\n3.  **Create A16 (Site Map and Navigation Structure):** Outline the overall architecture of the website, defining the pages and how they link together.\n4.  **Create Page Blueprints (A17-A20):** Generate detailed blueprints for each core page (Home, Showcase, Tutorials, About/Mission), detailing their specific content, layout, and functionality.\n5.  **Update A0 (Master Artifact List):** Add the newly created planning artifacts (A15 through A20) to the master list.\n6.  **Update A4 (Universal Task Checklist):** Review the checklist, mark the planning tasks introduced in this cycle as complete (T-5, T-6), and refine the upcoming implementation tasks (T-2, T-3) based on the detailed blueprints generated.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist-and-Aesthetics.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15: aiascent.dev - Asset Wishlist and Design Aesthetics\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Defines the required visual assets, overall design language, and thematic aesthetics for the aiascent.dev website, focusing on a professional, empowering, and modern look.\n  - **Tags:** design, aesthetics, assets, wishlist, branding, ui, ux, citizen architect\n\n## 1\\. Overview & Goal\n\nThis document outlines the visual assets required for the `aiascent.dev` website and defines the guiding principles for its design aesthetics. The goal is to create a visual identity that is professional, modern, and reflective of the sophisticated nature of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), while also subtly conveying the empowering theme of the \"Citizen Architect\" or \"Cognitive Capitalist.\"\n\n## 2\\. Design Aesthetics: The \"Empowered Developer\" Look\n\nThe aesthetic should blend the clean, functional design of modern developer tools with a sense of optimism and empowerment.\n\n  - **Color Palette:** Primarily dark mode focused, using deep blues, charcoals, and blacks for the background. Accent colors should be vibrant but used sparingly for calls to action and highlights (e.g., electric blue, crisp white, perhaps a subtle gold or green highlight).\n  - **Typography:** Clean, highly readable sans-serif fonts. (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or similar modern fonts).\n  - **Visual Style:** Minimalist, with a focus on clarity and hierarchy. Use subtle gradients, soft shadows, and clean lines. Avoid clutter.\n  - **Thematic Tone (Citizen Architect):** The design should feel sophisticated and powerful. We want users to feel like they are accessing a high-end tool that enhances their capabilities. Visual elements might subtly nod to themes of networks, intelligence amplification, and building (architecture).\n\n## 3\\. Asset Wishlist\n\n### 3.1.

I will create a master system prompt artifact, `A15.1`, modeled after the provided example (`A179`), which will define the core aesthetic for all generated assets: a sophisticated, dark, modern, and precise look suitable for a developer tool. Following that, I will generate individual prompt artifacts (`A15.2` through `A15.7`) for each specific asset listed in the wishlist (`A15`), including the logo, icons, and OG image. I will then update the Master Artifact List (`A0`) to include these new documentation artifacts.\n\nNext, I will begin the implementation of the home page (Task T-3 from `A4`). This involves creating four new React components: `HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, and `MissionSection`. I will integrate these into the main `page.tsx` file, replacing the existing placeholder content. The `WorkflowVisualization` component will be the designated location for the `pcp.gif` mentioned in the prompt. I will also draw inspiration from the `automationsaas` context to incorporate dynamic and visually engaging components to elevate the page design.\n\nFinally, I will update the `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to reflect the progress made on these tasks. This approach prioritizes documentation first, then moves to a structured implementation of the code, aligning with the project's established workflow.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create Master Image Prompt (A15.1):** Draft a new artifact `A15.1` to serve as the master system prompt for image generation, adapting the style from `A179` to fit the `aiascent.dev` aesthetic (dark, modern, professional).\n2.  **Create Individual Image Prompts (A15.2-A15.7):** Generate six new artifacts, each containing a specific prompt for the assets listed in `A15` (Logo, Favicon, Context Curation Icon, Parallel Co-pilot Icon, Iterative Workflow Icon, OG Image).\n3.  **Update Master Artifact List (A0):** Modify `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md` to include the newly created image prompt artifacts.\n4.  **Create Home Page Components:** Generate the file shells for the new home page components:\n    *   `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`\n    *   `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`\n    *   `src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx`\n    *   `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`\n5.  **Implement `WorkflowVisualization.tsx`:** Build out this component, specifically ensuring it includes the `pcp.gif` as requested, to visually demonstrate the DCE workflow.\n6.  **Implement `FeaturesSection.tsx`:** Build the features section using the icon placeholders defined in `A15`.\n7.  **Implement `MissionSection.tsx`:** Build the mission section, drawing aesthetic inspiration from components like `LampComponent` in the `automationsaas` context.\n8.  **Implement `HeroSection.tsx`:** Build the hero section, incorporating the primary hero image and leveraging dynamic components like `ContainerScroll` for an engaging user experience.\n9.  **Update Home Page (`page.tsx`):** Reconstruct the main `src/app/page.tsx` to import and arrange the new home page components, replacing the C1 placeholder content.\n10. **Update Task Checklist (A4):** Update `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to mark T-3 as \"In Progress\" and document the work completed in this cycle.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.1: aiascent.dev - Image Generation System Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A master system prompt to guide a multimodal AI in generating a thematically and stylistically coherent set of visual assets for the aiascent.dev website.\n- **Tags:** documentation, image generation, prompt engineering, ai art, branding, design system\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets for the aiascent.dev website. Its goal is to establish a consistent, professional aesthetic that aligns with the project's identity as a sophisticated tool for developers. This prompt should be used as the foundational instruction set for generating the specific assets listed in A15.\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Citizen Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and branding specialist. Your task is to generate a series of clean, professional, and thematically coherent visual assets for a developer-focused website promoting a VS Code extension called the \"Data Curation Environment (DCE)\".\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **sophisticated, modern, and precise**. It should feel like a high-end developer tool.\n    *   **Color Palette:** The primary theme is **dark mode**. Use a deep, near-black background (e.g., `#0A0A0A` or `hsl(0 0% 3.9%)`). Accents should be vibrant and futuristic, primarily using **electric blue, cyan, and a hint of deep purple**. White or light grey should be used for text and fine details to ensure high contrast and readability.\n    *   **Style:** The style should be **clean and minimalist**. For icons, think simple, geometric shapes with clear meanings. For graphics, use sharp lines, subtle gradients, and a sense of depth without being overly complex. Avoid photorealism unless specifically requested.\n\n2.  **Maintain Thematic Cohesion:** The assets must feel like they belong to a single, unified product suite. The core themes are:\n    *   **Precision & Control:** The DCE allows developers to be precise. This can be visualized with grids, fine lines, and focused elements.\n    *   **Workflow & Iteration:** The tool is about process. This can be visualized with circular motifs, arrows, and interconnected nodes.\n    *   **AI Collaboration:** This is a human-AI partnership. This can be visualized by showing human and abstract digital elements interacting.\n\n3.  **Technical Specifications:**\n    *   **Icons (SVG):** Generate as SVG code. Icons should be monochrome or use a maximum of two colors from the palette. They must be clear and legible at small sizes. The style should be line-art or simple filled shapes.\n    *   **Graphics (PNG/WEBP):** For more complex images like the OG:Image, the output should be a high-resolution PNG. The aspect ratio for the OG image must be 1200x630px.\n    *   **Logo (SVG):** The logo must be exceptionally clean and symbolic. It needs to work as a single-color icon and with the full brand palette.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific request for an asset (e.g., \"Generate the icon for 'Context Curation'\"). You will apply these core directives to generate a single, high-quality asset that fits perfectly within the established brand identity.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Asset-Prompt-Logo.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Asset Prompt: Logo\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific generation prompt for the aiascent.dev logo.\n- **Tags:** documentation, image generation, prompt, logo, branding\n\n## 1.

Generation Prompt\n\n**System Prompt:** (Use A15.1 - Image Generation System Prompt)\n\n**User Prompt:**\n\nGenerate the logo for \"aiascent.dev\".\n\nThe logo should be a minimalist, abstract, and geometric mark. It should symbolize the concept of \"ascent\" and AI-driven development.\n\n**Core Idea:** Combine the letter 'A' with an upward-pointing arrow or mountain peak. The 'A' itself should be stylized to look like a schematic or a circuit path.\n\n**Execution:**\n- Use clean, sharp lines.\n- The design must be balanced and symmetrical.\n- The output should be a single SVG file.\n- It must be effective as a single-color mark (e.g., all white on a dark background).\n- Optionally, provide a version where the arrow or a key part of the circuit path uses a subtle gradient of electric blue to cyan.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.3-Asset-Prompt-Favicon.md\">\n# Artifact A15.3: aiascent.dev - Asset Prompt: Favicon\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific generation prompt for the aiascent.dev favicon.\n- **Tags:** documentation, image generation, prompt, favicon, branding\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the Cycle 3 requests and formulated a comprehensive plan. My course of action prioritizes the creation of new documentation artifacts for image generation, followed by a significant implementation phase for the homepage redesign.\n\nFirst, I will generate a complete set of new artifacts (`A15.1` through `A15.7`) to provide detailed image generation prompts for all required assets listed in the Asset Wishlist (A15). This includes a master system prompt modeled after best practices observed in the `aiascentgame` context, ensuring a consistent and high-quality aesthetic. I will also update the Master Artifact List (A0) to properly catalog these new documents.\n\nNext, I will address the homepage implementation (T-3 from A4). I will begin by updating the homepage design document (A16) to incorporate the user's `pcp.gif`, specifying its placement within the workflow visualization section. Following this, I will create four new React components (`HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, `MissionSection`) which will form the new body of the homepage. These components will be built according to the specifications in A16 and will leverage dynamic and visually engaging elements from the `automationsaas` context to create a professional and compelling user experience.\n\nFinally, I will replace the placeholder content in `src/app/page.tsx` with these new components and create placeholder pages for `/learn` and `/mission` to ensure all navigation links in the header are functional. I will also update the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to reflect the progress made on these tasks.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create `A15.1` Master Image Generation System Prompt:** Adapt the structure from `A179.

Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets (logos, icons, etc.) for the `aiascent.dev` website. Its goal is to establish a consistent, professional, and thematically aligned aesthetic that reflects the project's core identity as a sophisticated tool for AI-assisted development. This prompt is modeled on the successful `A179. RDS - Image Generation System Prompt.md`.\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Citizen Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and visual identity consultant specializing in branding for high-end developer tools and enterprise software. Your task is to generate a series of clean, modern, and thematically rich assets for a project called **aiascent.dev**, the home of the \"Data Curation Environment\" (DCE) VS Code extension.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Precision Futurism.\"** This is a clean, dark-themed, and highly professional style. It is not dystopian cyberpunk or sterile sci-fi. It is the aesthetic of a powerful, well-crafted tool.\n    *   **Color Palette:** Primarily dark, sophisticated backgrounds (deep charcoal, near-black). Accents should be vibrant and electric, conveying intelligence and energy. Primary accents are **electric blue (#00BFFF)** and **cyan (#00FFFF)**. Use these for glows, highlights, and key elements.\n    *   **Style:** Vector-based, minimalist, and sharp. Lines should be clean. Gradients should be smooth and subtle. Avoid clutter and unnecessary detail. The feeling should be one of clarity, focus, and power.\n    *   **Lighting:** For icons and logos, lighting should be internal, as if the elements themselves are emitting a soft, controlled glow. This reinforces the \"intelligence\" theme.\n\n2.  **Embrace Thematic Reinforcement:** Every asset must visually communicate one of the core concepts of the DCE:\n    *   **Curation & Precision:** Selecting and organizing complex information.\n    *   **Parallelism & Comparison:** Viewing multiple options or streams of data simultaneously.\n    *   **Iteration & Cycles:** A continuous, refining workflow.\n    *   **Human-AI Collaboration:** A partnership between a human mind and a digital intelligence.\n\n3.  **Maintain Professional Quality & Format:**\n    *   **Format:** All assets should be generated as **SVG**s unless otherwise specified. They must have transparent backgrounds and be infinitely scalable.\n    *   **Clarity:** Icons must be instantly recognizable and clear, even at small sizes. Logos must be legible and impactful.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific request for an asset (e.g., \"an icon for Context Curation\"). You will apply the **\"Precision Futurism\"** aesthetic and the **Thematic Reinforcement** principles to generate a single, high-quality SVG asset that fulfills the request.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Logo (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the main aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, logo, design, assets\n\n## 1. Asset Details\n\n- **Asset ID:** AS-01\n- **Asset Name:** Logo\n- **Format:** SVG\n- **Location:** `public/assets/logo.svg`\n\n## 2. Image Generation Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA minimalist and modern logo for \"aiascent.dev\". The logo should consist of an abstract icon and the logotype \"AIAscent.dev\".\n\n**Icon:**\nThe icon should be an abstract representation of an upward-pointing arrow or a stylized mountain peak, representing \"ascent\". This arrow should be composed of two distinct but intertwined shapes, one solid and one made of clean, parallel lines, symbolizing the partnership between human (solid, foundational) and AI (digital, structured). The entire icon should have a subtle, internal glow of electric blue.\n\n**Logotype:**\nThe text \"AIAscent.dev\" should be in a clean, sans-serif, slightly condensed font (similar to Inter or Monument Extended). The \"AI\" part of the name should be a slightly lighter weight or color than \"Ascent.dev\" to create a subtle distinction.\n\n**Overall:**\nThe logo must be presented on a transparent background, rendered in SVG format. It needs to be clean, professional, and immediately legible, suitable for a high-end developer tool.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.3-Image-Prompt-Favicon.md\">\n# Artifact A15.3: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Favicon (AS-02)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the aiascent.dev favicon (AS-02).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, favicon, design, assets\n\n## 1. Asset Details\n\n- **Asset ID:** AS-02\n- **Asset Name:** Favicon\n- **Format:** ICO/SVG\n- **Location:** `public/assets/favicon.ico`\n\n## 2. Image Generation Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA favicon based on the icon from the `aiascent.dev` logo (AS-01).\n\n**Design:**\nIsolate the abstract, upward-pointing arrow icon from the main logo. The icon should be simplified to ensure maximum clarity at very small sizes (16x16 and 32x32 pixels). It should retain the core concept of two intertwined shapes representing the human-AI partnership.\n\nThe icon should be rendered in a vibrant electric blue, enclosed within a rounded square with a dark charcoal background (#111111). This ensures visibility on both light and dark browser tabs.\n\n**Format:**\nGenerate as a high-resolution SVG on a transparent background, which can then be converted to an ICO file containing multiple sizes.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.4-Image-Prompt-Icon-Context-Curation.md\">\n# Artifact A15.4: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Icon: Context Curation (AS-04)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the \"Context Curation\" icon (AS-04).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, icon, design, assets\n\n## 1.

Image Generation Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA minimalist, vector-style icon representing \"Context Curation\" for the `aiascent.dev` website.\n\n**Design:**\nThe icon should depict a stylized, abstract file tree or a stack of documents on the left. On the right, a glowing cyan checkmark or a magnifying glass is overlaid, symbolizing the act of selection and precision. The overall shape should be contained within a conceptual boundary (like a square or circle) but the lines can be open.\n\nThe lines should be clean and sharp. The primary elements should be a neutral grey or off-white, while the selection element (the checkmark or magnifier) should be a vibrant, glowing cyan to draw focus.\n\n**Format:**\nGenerate as an SVG with a transparent background. The design must be clear and instantly understandable at a small scale.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.5-Image-Prompt-Icon-Parallel-Co-Pilot.md\">\n# Artifact A15.5: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Icon: Parallel Co-Pilot (AS-05)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the \"Parallel Co-Pilot\" icon (AS-05).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, icon, design, assets\n\n## 1. Asset Details\n\n- **Asset ID:** AS-05\n- **Asset Name:** Icon: Parallel Co-Pilot\n- **Format:** SVG\n- **Location:** `public/assets/icons/parallel-copilot.svg`\n\n## 2. Image Generation Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA minimalist, vector-style icon representing \"Parallel Co-Pilot\" for the `aiascent.dev` website.\n\n**Design:**\nThe icon should visually represent the comparison of multiple AI responses. Depict two or three simple, rectangular panels side-by-side. The panels should contain abstract, horizontal lines to represent code or text.\n\nA central, glowing electric blue line or arrow should be positioned between the panels, indicating a process of comparison or selection. The panels themselves should be a neutral grey or off-white. The icon needs to convey the idea of parallel streams of information being analyzed simultaneously.\n\n**Format:**\nGenerate as an SVG with a transparent background. The design must be clear and instantly understandable at a small scale.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.6-Image-Prompt-Icon-Iterative-Workflow.md\">\n# Artifact A15.6: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Icon: Iterative Workflow (AS-06)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the \"Iterative Workflow\" icon (AS-06).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, icon, design, assets\n\n## 1. Asset Details\n\n- **Asset ID:** AS-06\n- **Asset Name:** Icon: Iterative Workflow\n- **Format:** SVG\n- **Location:** `public/assets/icons/iterative-workflow.svg`\n\n## 2. Image Generation Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA minimalist, vector-style icon representing \"Iterative Workflow\" for the `aiascent.dev` website.\n\n**Design:**\nThe icon should symbolize a continuous, cyclical process of refinement.

Purpose and Goal\n\nThe Home page is the primary entry point for all visitors. Its goal is to immediately convey the purpose and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), establishing credibility and motivating developers to explore the tool and the underlying philosophy of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n## 2\\. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  * **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple).\n  * **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  * Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  * Logo on the left, navigation links (Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  * **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component in the `automationsaas` context) to add depth.\n  * **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  * **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  * **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  * **Visual:** The centerpiece will be the `dce-hero-screenshot.png` (A15, AS-03), presented within a stylized container (like the `ContainerScroll` component from AutomationSaaS) to give it a dynamic, engaging feel.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution\n\n  * **Layout:** A two-column or alternating layout highlighting the inefficiencies of standard AI workflows and how DCE solves them.\n  * **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools. Start Building the Future.\"\n  * **Points (Visualized with Icons from A15):**\n      * **Problem:** Manual context management is slow and error-prone. **Solution (Icon AS-04):** DCE provides intuitive, visual context curation directly in VS Code.\n      * **Problem:** Testing AI suggestions is risky and time-consuming. **Solution (Icon AS-05):** The Parallel Co-Pilot enables rapid, side-by-side comparison and safe, Git-integrated testing.\n      * **Problem:** AI collaboration lacks structure and auditability. **Solution (Icon AS-06):** DCE captures the entire development process as an iterative, auditable knowledge graph.\n\n### 4.4. Section 3: The DCE Workflow Visualization (Updated C3)\n\n  * **Layout:** A visually engaging section that clearly demonstrates the DCE in action.\n  * **Headline:** \"See The Workflow in Action.\"\n  * **Visual:** This section will prominently feature the **`pcp.gif`** provided by the curator. The GIF, which shows the entire workflow from opening a workspace to parsing responses, is the most effective way to communicate the tool's function. It should be displayed in a large format, possibly within a stylized, browser-like frame to give it context.\n  * **Content:** Accompanying text will briefly explain what the user is seeing in the GIF: \"The `pcp.gif` demonstrates the core loop of the DCE: curating context, generating a prompt, parsing multiple AI responses in parallel, and accepting the best solution directly into your workspace. This entire cycle happens in minutes, not hours.\"\n\n### 4.5. Section 4: The Mission (Cognitive Capitalism)\n\n  * **Layout:** A more text-focused section with a strong visual anchor (perhaps utilizing the `LampComponent` aesthetic from `automationsaas` for dramatic lighting).\n  * **Headline:** \"More Than Code: The Rise of Cognitive Capitalism.\"\n  * **Content:** A brief, compelling summary of the strategic vision—that mastering AI collaboration is essential for competitiveness and individual empowerment. This section connects the tool (DCE) to the broader mission (combating AI centralization and domination policies).\n  * **CTA:** \"Read Our Mission\" (Links to `/mission`).\n\n### 4.6. Footer\n\n  * Standard site footer (from `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`).\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"public/assets/videos/.gitkeep\">\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C3 - Home Page Implementation\n'use client';\n\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/button\";\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\nimport { ContainerScroll } from \"@/components/global/container-scroll-animation\";\nimport Image from \"next/image\";\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\n  return (\n    <section className=\"h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0c0c0c_100%)]\"></div>\n      <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-100px] md:mt-[-50px]\">\n        <ContainerScroll\n          titleComponent={\n            <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n              <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold mb-8\">\n                Master the Human-AI Workflow.\n                <br />\n                Become a Citizen Architect.\n              </h1>\n              <p className=\"text-neutral-500 text-lg max-w-4xl text-center mb-8\">\n                The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the request for Cycle 3 and formulated a comprehensive plan. My primary focus will be on two main streams of work: first, creating the documentation artifacts for the required image assets, and second, implementing the home page design as outlined in the existing artifacts.\n\nFor the image assets, I will create a master system prompt (`A15.1`) to define the overall aesthetic, modeled after best practices from the `aiascentgame` context. Following that, I will generate individual prompt artifacts for the logo, favicon, feature icons, and the OG image. I will also update the Asset Wishlist (`A15`) to include the `pcp.gif` mentioned in the cycle context and add all these new documents to the Master Artifact List (`A0`).\n\nFor the home page implementation, I will develop the individual sections as separate components (`HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, `MissionSection`) based on the blueprint in `A16`. The `WorkflowVisualization` will be designed to showcase the `pcp.gif`. I will then integrate these components into the main `page.tsx`, replacing the current placeholder content. This will also involve refining the existing `Header` and `Footer` to match the sophisticated, dark aesthetic. Finally, I will update the `A4` task checklist to reflect the work completed and outline the next steps.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create Image Prompt Artifacts (Documentation First):**\n    *   Create `A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md` by adapting the principles from `A179` in the `aiascentgame` context, tailoring it to the `aiascent.dev` project's aesthetic.\n    *   Create `A15.2-Logo-Prompt.md` for the site logo.\n    *   Create `A15.3-Favicon-Prompt.md` for the browser favicon.\n    *   Create `A15.4-Icon-Context-Curation-Prompt.md` for the first feature icon.\n    *   Create `A15.5-Icon-Parallel-Copilot-Prompt.md` for the second feature icon.\n    *   Create `A15.6-Icon-Iterative-Workflow-Prompt.md` for the third feature icon.\n    *   Create `A15.7-OG-Image-Prompt.md` for the social media sharing image.\n2.  **Update Asset & Master Artifact Lists:**\n    *   Update `A15-Asset-Wishlist.md` to include an entry for `pcp.gif` and to reference the new prompt artifacts.\n    *   Update `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md` to catalog all the new `A15.x` artifacts.\n3.  **Implement Home Page Components:**\n    *   Create the directory `src/components/home`.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` based on `A16`, utilizing a dynamic layout.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx` to display the three core features with their icons.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx`, which will be designed to embed and display the `pcp.gif`.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx` as per `A16`.\n4.  **Integrate Home Page and Refine Layout:**\n    *   Update `src/app/page.tsx` to import and render the new home page components in the correct order.\n    *   Refine the styling in `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` and `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` to align with the dark, professional theme described in `A16`.\n5.  **Update Task Checklist:**\n    *   Update `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to mark progress on T-3 and set the stage for the next cycle.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\">\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C3 (Add A15.x image prompt artifacts)\n\n## 1\\.

The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and branding specialist. Your task is to generate a series of clean, modern, and thematically coherent visual assets for a high-end developer tool website, `aiascent.dev`.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Sophisticated Minimalism & Technical Precision.\"** This is a professional tool for expert users.\n    *   **Color Palette:** Primarily a dark theme. Use a near-black or very dark charcoal background (`#111111` or `#1C1C1E`). Accents should be a vibrant, electric blue or cyan (`#00BFFF` or `#00A9E0`) to represent data, energy, and intelligence. Use clean whites and light grays for text and secondary elements.\n    *   **Style:** Minimalist, clean lines, and geometric. Avoid clutter. For icons, think vector-based, line-art style. For more complex images, think high-resolution, professional product photography or abstract digital art.\n    *   **Mood:** Professional, precise, powerful, intelligent, and trustworthy.\n\n2.  **Function Over Form (But Make Form Excellent):** Every asset must be instantly recognizable and clearly communicate its purpose.\n    *   **Icons:** Must be simple, symbolic, and clear even at small sizes. They should look like a cohesive set. Use a consistent line weight.\n    *   **Logos:** Must be strong, memorable, and legible. It should work as a simple monogram or a full wordmark.\n    *   **Images:** Must directly relate to the theme of software development, AI, and data management.\n\n3.  **Technical Specifications:**\n    *   **Format:** Generate assets in a vector-friendly format. Describe them as if you were creating an SVG. For raster images, specify a high resolution (e.g., 4K) and a 16:9 aspect ratio unless otherwise noted.\n    *   **Background:** For icons and logos, always generate on a transparent background unless specified otherwise.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with specific prompts for individual assets. For each one, you will apply these master directives to create a single, high-quality visual that fits perfectly within the `aiascent.dev` brand identity.\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Logo-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Logo Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, logo, design\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nOkay, Cycle 3. I will address all three points from the user's request.\n\nFirst, I will create the full suite of documentation for generating the website's visual assets. This includes a master system prompt modeled on a best-practice example from a previous project, as well as individual prompt artifacts for each required asset outlined in the `A15-Asset-Wishlist`. I will then update the `A0-Master-Artifact-List` to include these new documentation files.\n\nSecond, I will execute task `T-3` from the `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist`, which is the implementation of the home page. I will replace the placeholder content on `src/app/page.tsx` and build out the page structure as defined in `A16-Page-Design-Home`. This involves creating four new section components: `HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, and `MissionSection`.\n\nThird, as part of the home page implementation, I will address the specific request to feature the `pcp.gif`. I will place this animation within the new `WorkflowVisualization` component to clearly demonstrate the DCE's core workflow to visitors.\n\nTo enhance the home page's dynamism and align with the user's appreciation for the `automationsaas` project's aesthetic, I will port over and integrate several of its key animation components, such as `ContainerScroll` for the hero section and `LampComponent` for the mission section.\n\nFinally, I will update the task checklist (`A4`) to mark T-3 as in progress and set up the tasks for the next cycle.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create A15.1:** Generate `A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md`, modeling it after `A179` from the `aiascentgame` context but tailoring the aesthetic to `aiascent.dev`'s sophisticated, dark-mode-first theme.\n2.  **Create A15.2-A15.7:** Generate the six individual prompt artifacts for the logo, favicon, three feature icons, and the Open Graph image as specified in the asset wishlist.\n3.  **Update A0:** Add entries for all seven new `A15.x` artifacts to the `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md`.\n4.  **Port Animation Components:** Recreate the `ContainerScroll`, `Lamp`, and `Sparkles` components from the `automationsaas` context and place them in a new `src/components/landing` directory.\n5.  **Create Home Page Sections:**\n    *   Create `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`, integrating the `ContainerScroll` component to display the `dce-hero-screenshot.png`.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx` to display the three core features with their corresponding icons.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx` and embed the `pcp.gif` within it.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`, using the `LampComponent` for a dramatic visual effect.\n6.  **Implement Home Page:** Update `src/app/page.tsx` to clear the placeholder content and assemble the new home page sections in the correct order as defined by `A16`.\n7.  **Refine Header:** Update `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` to improve its styling and alignment with the overall dark, modern aesthetic.\n8.  **Update A4:** Update the status of task T-3 in `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` and prepare for the next cycle's tasks.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.1: aiascent.dev - Image Generation System Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A master system prompt to guide a multimodal AI in generating a thematically and stylistically coherent set of images and icons for the aiascent.dev website.\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt engineering, system prompt, ai art, branding, design\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets for the `aiascent.dev` website. Its goal is to establish a consistent, professional, and thematically appropriate aesthetic that reflects the sophistication of the Data Curation Environment (DCE) tool.\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Digital Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are a world-class graphic designer and branding expert specializing in developer tools and enterprise software. Your task is to generate a series of hyper-clean, professional, and thematically rich visual assets (logos, icons, and marketing images) for a project called **aiascent.dev**, a promotional website for a VS Code extension named the **Data Curation Environment (DCE)**.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Sophisticated, Modern, and Precise.\"** This is a tool for expert developers. The visuals must be clean, clear, and convey a sense of power and precision.\n    *   **Color Palette:** Primarily a dark-mode aesthetic. Use a base of near-black (`#0A0A0A`) or very dark gray. Accents should be a vibrant, electric cyan (`#00FFFF`) and a cool, intelligent blue (`#3B82F6`). White and light grays should be used for contrast and text.\n    *   **Style:** Minimalist, vector-based, and sharp. Avoid photorealism unless specifically requested. Lines should be crisp. Gradients should be subtle and smooth. For icons, think modern iconography like that used by Vercel, Linear, or Stripe.\n    *   **Mood:** Professional, authoritative, and futuristic without being sci-fi fantasy. The feeling should be that of a cutting-edge, indispensable professional tool.\n\n2.  **Embrace Clarity and Recognizability:** Every icon and logo must be instantly recognizable and clearly communicate its purpose.\n    *   **Simplicity is Key:** Icons should be simple enough to be understood at a small size (e.g., 16x16 pixels). Avoid excessive detail.\n    *   **Metaphorical Consistency:** The visual metaphors should be consistent. If a \"file\" is represented in one icon, it should be represented similarly in others.\n\n3.  **Technical Specifications:**\n    *   **Format:** Generate assets as SVGs for scalability, unless a raster format like PNG is explicitly requested.\n    *   **Background:** All logos and icons must be generated on a transparent background. Marketing images should adhere to the specified scene but maintain the core aesthetic.\n    *   **Cleanliness:** Ensure vector assets have clean paths and no unnecessary anchor points.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific prompt for a single asset. You will apply the **Master Aesthetic** and all core directives to generate that asset. Pay close attention to the specific requirements of each prompt to create a cohesive and professional brand identity for aiascent.dev.\n</file_path>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Logo-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Logo Prompt (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, logo, branding\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nOkay, I've analyzed the requests for Cycle 3. My plan is to first create the documentation and assets requested, then begin the implementation of the home page.\n\nFirst, I will create a series of new artifacts for the image generation prompts as requested in A15. This includes a master system prompt (A15.1) modeled on best practices from a similar project, and individual prompts for the logo, icons, and other assets. This \"documentation-first\" approach ensures clarity before any assets are generated. I will also update the home page design document (A16) to incorporate the user's `pcp.gif` into the workflow visualization section.\n\nNext, I will update the master artifact list (A0) to include all the newly created prompt documents.\n\nFinally, I will begin work on Task T-3 from the checklist: implementing the home page. I will create the placeholder components for each major section outlined in the design document (A16)—Hero, Features, Workflow, and Mission. I will then update the main `page.tsx` to render these new components, replacing the temporary content from the initial scaffolding. This sets the stage for fleshing out each component in the subsequent cycle.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `A16-Page-Design-Home.md`:** Modify the \"Workflow Visualization\" section to explicitly mention the use of the `pcp.gif` provided by the curator.\n2.  **Create `A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md`:** Generate a new master system prompt artifact, modeling its structure and tone on `A179. RDS - Image Generation System Prompt.md` but tailoring the aesthetic to `aiascent.dev`.\n3.  **Create `A15.2` through `A15.7`:** Generate six new artifacts containing specific image generation prompts for the logo, favicon, feature icons, and OG image as outlined in the asset wishlist.\n4.  **Update `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md`:** Add entries for all the new `A15.x` artifacts to maintain a complete and organized list of project documentation.\n5.  **Create Home Page Component Shells:** Generate the initial files for the home page sections: `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`, `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`, `src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx`, and `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`. These will be placeholders to establish the structure.\n6.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** Replace the existing placeholder content with the new home page section components.\n7.  **Update `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`:** Mark the initial setup of the home page components as in-progress under task T-3 and prepare the checklist for the next cycle's work.\n8.  **Add Curator Activity:** Include a section to instruct the curator on where to place the `pcp.gif` file.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nPlease place the `pcp.gif` file you mentioned into the `public/assets/images/` directory.

Purpose and Goal\n\nThe Home page is the primary entry point for all visitors. Its goal is to immediately convey the purpose and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), establishing credibility and motivating developers to explore the tool and the underlying philosophy of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n## 2\\. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  * **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple).\n  * **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  * Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  * Logo on the left, navigation links (Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  * **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component in the `automationsaas` context) to add depth.\n  * **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  * **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  * **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  * **Visual:** The centerpiece will be the `dce-hero-screenshot.png` (A15, AS-03), presented within a stylized container (like the `ContainerScroll` component from AutomationSaaS) to give it a dynamic, engaging feel.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution\n\n  * **Layout:** A two-column or alternating layout highlighting the inefficiencies of standard AI workflows and how DCE solves them.\n  * **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools. Start Building the Future.\"\n  * **Points (Visualized with Icons from A15):**\n      * **Problem:** Manual context management is slow and error-prone. **Solution (Icon AS-04):** DCE provides intuitive, visual context curation directly in VS Code.\n      * **Problem:** Testing AI suggestions is risky and time-consuming. **Solution (Icon AS-05):** The Parallel Co-Pilot enables rapid, side-by-side comparison and safe, Git-integrated testing.\n      * **Problem:** AI collaboration lacks structure and auditability. **Solution (Icon AS-06):** DCE captures the entire development process as an iterative, auditable knowledge graph.\n\n### 4.4. Section 3: The DCE Workflow Visualization (Interactive Element)\n\n  * **Layout:** A visually engaging section centered around a clear demonstration of the product in action.\n  * **Headline:** \"The Power of Iteration: See the DCE Workflow\"\n  * **Visual:** This section will prominently feature the `pcp.gif` provided by the curator. The GIF runs through a complete project workflow, from opening a workspace to onboarding and processing multiple AI responses, clearly demonstrating how the DCE operates. The surrounding text will provide context for each stage shown in the animation.\n  * **Curator Note:** The `pcp.gif` should be placed in `public/assets/images/`.\n\n### 4.5.

Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets (logos, icons, etc.) for the `aiascent.dev` website. Its goal is to establish a consistent aesthetic and thematic direction for the image generation AI, ensuring all visuals align with the project's brand identity as a sophisticated, modern developer tool.\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Digital Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and brand identity specialist with a deep understanding of iconography for developer tools and high-tech software. Your task is to generate a series of clean, modern, and thematically rich vector-style graphics for the `aiascent.dev` website, a promotional site for a powerful VS Code extension.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Sophisticated & Futuristic Minimalism.\"**\n    *   **Style:** Clean lines, geometric shapes, and a minimalist approach are paramount. Avoid clutter, excessive detail, and photorealism. The output should be suitable for SVG format.\n    *   **Color Palette:** The primary palette is monochrome (shades of dark gray, black, and white) accented with a vibrant, glowing **electric blue or cyan**. Gradients should be smooth and used purposefully to suggest energy or digital light.\n    *   **Feeling:** The assets should feel precise, professional, innovative, and authoritative. They belong to a cutting-edge tool for serious developers.\n\n2.  **Embrace Clarity and Recognizability:** Every icon and logo must have a dual purpose.\n    *   **Purpose 1: Be Instantly Recognizable.** The design must be simple and clear enough to be understood at small sizes (e.g., as a favicon or in a feature list).\n    *   **Purpose 2: Convey the Concept.** The visual metaphor must directly relate to the feature or idea it represents (e.g., \"Context Curation\" should visually suggest file management or selection).\n\n3.  **Maintain Vector-Ready Quality:**\n    *   **Format:** Generate images that look like clean vector graphics. Use solid colors, simple gradients, and sharp edges. Do not produce rasterized, painterly, or complex photographic styles. The final assets will be used as SVGs on the website.\n    *   **Background:** Unless specified otherwise, generate all icons and logos on a transparent or solid dark background to fit the website's dark-mode-first theme.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific `<Image Prompt>` for each asset required. For each prompt, you will apply these core directives to generate a single, powerful, and on-brand graphic.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Logo-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Logo Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the main aiascent.dev logo.\n- **Tags:** assets, prompt engineering, ai art, logo design\n\n## 1.

My primary focus will be on generating the necessary image prompt artifacts and beginning the implementation of the home page as specified in the updated task list and design documents.\n\nFirst, I will create a master system prompt for image generation (`A15.1`) modeled on best practices. Following that, I will generate individual prompt artifacts for each required asset in the wishlist (`A15.2` through `A15.7`), covering the logo, icons, and social media image. I will then update the Master Artifact List (`A0`) to include these new documents.\n\nNext, I will address the user's request to feature the `pcp.gif` by updating the Home Page Design document (`A16`) to explicitly incorporate it into the workflow visualization section.\n\nFinally, I will begin implementing the home page itself (Task T-3). This involves creating four new React components for the various sections (Hero, Features, Workflow Visualization, and Mission) and integrating them into the main `page.tsx`. The workflow visualization component will be specifically designed to display the `pcp.gif`.

Use a deep, near-black charcoal or dark navy as the base. Accents should be vibrant and electric, primarily **cyan** (`#00FFFF`), **electric blue**, and hints of **deep purple**. White should be used for high-contrast text and elements.\n    *   **Style:** Clean, vector-based graphics for icons and logos. For more complex images, aim for a hyper-realistic or photorealistic style that feels grounded and professional. Avoid cartoonish or overly abstract styles.\n    *   **Mood:** The mood is authoritative, intelligent, and powerful. The visuals should convey precision, efficiency, and the transformative potential of the DCE tool.\n\n2.  **Maintain Cohesion and Clarity:**\n    *   **Icons:** Icons must be instantly recognizable and communicate a single concept clearly. They should be designed as a cohesive set, sharing the same line weight, color palette, and visual language. They should be delivered as SVGs on a transparent background.\n    *   **Logos:** The logo should be simple, memorable, and scalable. It must work well in both monochrome and color, and on both light and dark backgrounds.\n    *   **Imagery:** More complex images (like the OG image) should feel like professional product shots or well-composed digital art. They must adhere to the core color palette and mood.\n\n3.  **Technical Specifications:**\n    *   **Format:** Unless specified otherwise, generate assets in a format suitable for web use (SVG for vectors, PNG/WEBP for raster images).\n    *   **Background:** All icons and logos must be generated on a transparent background.\n    *   **Aspect Ratio:** Pay close attention to specified aspect ratios, especially for social media images (e.g., 1.91:1 for OG images).\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with specific, individual prompts for each asset required. For each prompt, you will apply this Master System Prompt to ensure the final output is stylistically and thematically aligned with the `aiascent.dev` brand identity.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Logo-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Logo Prompt (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n- **Tags:** image prompt, logo, branding, asset\n\n## 1.

My course of action is to first create the documentation for the requested image prompts and then proceed with the implementation of the new home page design.\n\nFor the image prompts, I will create a master system prompt artifact (A15.1) to define the website's visual aesthetic, drawing inspiration from the `aiascentgame` context. Following that, I will generate individual artifacts (A15.2-A15.7) containing specific prompts for the logo, icons, and other required assets as listed in the Asset Wishlist (A15).\n\nFor the home page implementation, I will create four new components (`HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, `MissionSection`) as specified in the Home Page Design artifact (A16). The `WorkflowVisualization` component will be designed to showcase the user-provided `pcp.gif`, fulfilling that part of the request. I will then integrate these components into the main `page.tsx` file, replacing the existing placeholder content.

The `WorkflowVisualization.tsx` will include an `<img>` tag with `src=\"/assets/images/pcp.gif\"` to display the user's animation.\n6.  **Integrate Homepage Sections:** Update `src/app/page.tsx` to import and render the new home page section components, replacing the current placeholder content.\n7.  **Update Task Checklist (A4):** Modify `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to reflect the completion of the image prompt generation and the initial implementation of the home page (T-3).\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.1: aiascent.dev - Image Generation System Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A comprehensive system prompt to guide a multimodal AI in generating a thematically and stylistically coherent set of images, icons, and logos for the aiascent.dev website.\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt engineering, ai art, design, branding, dce\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets for the `aiascent.dev` website. Its goal is to establish a consistent, professional, and thematically resonant aesthetic that reflects the sophisticated and powerful nature of the Data Curation Environment (DCE). This prompt is modeled on the successful `A179` from the `aiascent.game` project.\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Citizen Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and branding specialist with a deep understanding of user interface design, developer tools, and corporate identity. Your task is to generate a series of hyper-clean, professional, and thematically rich assets (logos, icons, and images) for a promotional website for a VS Code extension called the \"Data Curation Environment\" (DCE).\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Sophisticated Developer Tool.\"** Think clean, precise, and modern. The visual language should evoke concepts of structure, clarity, and power.\n    *   **Color Palette:** Primarily a dark, near-black background (`#0A0A0A`). Accents should be a vibrant, electric blue (`#00A8FF`) or cyan (`#00E0FF`) to represent data flow and intelligence. White (`#FFFFFF`) should be used for text and primary iconographic elements for high contrast and readability.\n    *   **Style:** Vector-based, flat design for icons and logos. For more complex images (like hero or OG images), the style should be photorealistic or a highly polished 3D render, maintaining the same color palette and clean aesthetic. Avoid clutter and unnecessary ornamentation.\n\n2.  **Embrace Thematic Resonance:** Every asset must visually communicate one of the core concepts of the DCE:\n    *   **Curation & Precision:** Selecting and organizing data with intent. Visual metaphors include grids, layers, focused nodes, and structured pathways.\n    *   **Parallelism & Comparison:** Viewing multiple options simultaneously. Visual metaphors include side-by-side panels, branching paths, and split views.\n    *   **Iteration & Workflow:** A continuous, structured cycle of development. Visual metaphors include circular arrows, gears, and looped diagrams.\n    *   **Human-AI Collaboration:** A partnership between human intellect and artificial intelligence. Visual metaphors include interlocking shapes, shared interfaces, or a human hand interacting with a digital construct.\n\n3.  **Maintain Professional Quality & Format:**\n    *   **Logos & Icons:** Must be generated as clean SVGs on a transparent background. They should be simple, instantly recognizable, and effective at small sizes.\n    *   **Images:** Should be high-resolution (e.g., 4K) with a 16:9 aspect ratio for hero images and a 1200x630px aspect ratio for OG images. Composition should be clean, well-balanced, and focused.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific, single-purpose prompt for each asset I need. You will apply these master directives (Aesthetic, Theme, and Quality) to that specific prompt to generate a single, high-quality asset that fits perfectly within the `aiascent.dev` brand identity.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt: Logo\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific AI image generation prompt for the main logo of the aiascent.dev website.\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, logo, branding\n\n## 1. Asset ID\nAS-01: Logo\n\n## 2. Location\n`public/assets/logo.svg`\n\n## 3. Generation Prompt\n\n**Image Style:** Flat vector logo, SVG format, transparent background.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\"Create a modern, minimalist logo for a software company called 'AIAscent'. The logo should be composed of two parts: an icon and the text 'AIAscent.dev'. The icon should cleverly combine the letters 'A' and 'A' into a single, abstract shape that resembles an upward-pointing arrow or a mountain peak, symbolizing 'ascent'. The design must be clean, geometric, and precise. Use a single, vibrant electric blue color (#00A8FF) for the icon.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the user's request for Cycle 3 and formulated a comprehensive plan. My primary objectives are to generate a series of image prompt artifacts, update the homepage design document to include a new asset, and then implement the new homepage design by creating several new React components and integrating them.\n\nFirst, I will create a master system prompt for image generation (A15.1) that establishes a dark, sophisticated, developer-focused aesthetic for the `aiascent.dev` brand. Following that, I will generate individual prompt artifacts for each required asset listed in A15, including the logo, favicon, feature icons, and social media image. I will also update the master artifact list (A0) to catalog these new documents.\n\nNext, I will update the homepage design document (A16) to explicitly incorporate the `pcp.gif` provided by the curator. This GIF will serve as the central visual for the workflow visualization section.\n\nFinally, I will proceed with the implementation of the homepage itself (Task T-3). This involves creating four new components: `HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, and `MissionSection`. I will leverage components and aesthetic styles from the `automationsaas` context, such as `ContainerScroll` and `LampComponent`, to create a dynamic and visually engaging experience. This will require porting those components into the current project. I will then integrate these new components into the main `page.tsx` file, replacing the existing placeholder content. I will conclude by updating the universal task checklist (A4) to reflect the progress made.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create A15.1:** Generate the `A15.1 aiascent.dev - Master Image Generation System Prompt.md` artifact, modeling it after `A179` from the `aiascentgame` context but tailoring the aesthetic to be dark, modern, and developer-focused with specific color accents.\n2.  **Create A15.x Image Prompts:** Generate the individual image prompt artifacts (`A15.2` through `A15.7`) for the logo, favicon, three feature icons, and the Open Graph image, as specified in the `A15-Asset-Wishlist.md`.\n3.  **Update A0:** Update the `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md` to include all the newly created `A15.x` artifacts under a new \"Design and Assets\" sub-category.\n4.  **Update A16:** Modify `A16-Page-Design-Home.md` to explicitly state that the \"Workflow Visualization\" section will feature the `pcp.gif` located at `public/assets/videos/pcp.gif`.\n5.  **Port `automationsaas` Components:** Create `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`, `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`, and `src/components/global/sparkles.tsx` by porting the code from the `automationsaas` flattened repo context.\n6.  **Create Home Page Components:** Create the new files for the homepage sections: `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`, `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`, `src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx`, and `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`.\n7.  **Implement Home Page Components:** Populate the newly created components with JSX and logic according to the design in `A16`, utilizing the ported `automationsaas` components and referencing the asset paths from `A15`.\n8.  **Update `page.tsx`:** Modify the root `src/app/page.tsx` to import and render the new home page section components, replacing the C1 placeholder content.\n9.  **Update A4:** Update `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to mark task T-3 as \"In Progress\" and describe the implementation work completed in this cycle.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.1: aiascent.dev - Master Image Generation System Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A master system prompt to guide a multimodal AI in generating a thematically and stylistically coherent set of images, icons, and logos for the aiascent.dev website.\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt engineering, design system, branding, dce, aiascent.dev\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets for the `aiascent.dev` website. Its goal is to establish a consistent, professional, and thematically resonant aesthetic that reflects the sophistication and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Citizen Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and brand strategist specializing in developer tools and high-tech software. Your task is to generate a series of hyper-clean, professional, and thematically rich assets (logos, icons, and images) for a promotional website for a VS Code extension called the \"Data Curation Environment\" (DCE).\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Sophisticated Developer Precision.\"** This is a dark-mode-first design language that is clean, minimalist, and authoritative.\n    *   **Color Palette:** The primary background is a very dark gray or near-black (`#111827` or similar). The primary accent color is a vibrant, electric cyan/blue (`#22d3ee`). A secondary accent of a deep purple (`#8b5cf6`) can be used for contrast. Text and secondary elements are typically off-white or light gray.\n    *   **Style:** Minimalist and geometric. Lines are clean and sharp. Avoid clutter, noise, and overly complex textures. The feeling should be one of precision, control, and power.\n    *   **Lighting:** For images, lighting should be dramatic and cinematic, as if in a high-end tech commercial. Think soft ambient light with sharp, focused highlights on key elements. For icons and logos, lighting is generally flat and graphical, but subtle gradients can be used.\n\n2.  **Fulfill the Asset's Purpose:** Every asset you create has a specific job.\n    *   **Logos & Icons:** These must be instantly recognizable and symbolic. They should be simple enough to work at small sizes (like a favicon) but distinctive enough to be memorable. They must be generated as SVGs or high-resolution PNGs with transparent backgrounds.\n    *   **Illustrations & Images:** These assets tell a story. They must not only depict the subject of the prompt but also reinforce the core themes of the DCE: precision, control, efficiency, and the power of human-AI collaboration.\n\n3.  **Maintain Technical Excellence:**\n    *   **Vector-First (for Logos/Icons):** When creating logos and icons, think in terms of vectors. The output should be clean enough to be easily traced into an SVG.\n    *   **High Resolution:** All assets should be generated at a high resolution suitable for modern high-DPI displays.\n    *   **Consistency:** All generated assets must look like they belong to the same brand family. Use the color palette and minimalist style consistently across all outputs.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific prompt for a single asset (e.g., \"Create a logo,\" \"Generate an icon for 'Context Curation'\"). You will apply the **\"Sophisticated Developer Precision\"** aesthetic and the above directives to generate a single, high-quality asset that perfectly fits the `aiascent.dev` brand.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Logo (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the main aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt engineering, logo, branding, aiascent.dev\n\n## 1.

Image Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nCreate a modern, minimalist logo for \"aiascent.dev\".\n\nThe logo should be abstract and geometric, conveying concepts of ascension, data, and architecture. It could be an stylized 'A' that also looks like an upward-pointing arrow or a mountain peak.\n\nThe design must be clean, sharp, and professional, suitable for a high-tech developer tool.\n\nUse the primary color palette: a vibrant electric cyan/blue (`#22d3ee`) as the main color, with a dark background (`#111827`).\n\nThe output should be a vector-style graphic on a transparent background.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.3-Image-Prompt-Favicon.md\">\n# Artifact A15.3: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Favicon (AS-02)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the aiascent.dev favicon (AS-02).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt engineering, icon, favicon, branding, aiascent.dev\n\n## 1.

Image Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nGenerate a favicon based on the aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n\nTake the abstract, geometric 'A' / arrow symbol from the main logo and simplify it for a very small scale (16x16, 32x32). The icon must be instantly recognizable.\n\nThe icon should be a single, solid shape in the brand's vibrant electric cyan/blue (`#22d3ee`).\n\nThe output must be a high-resolution PNG with a transparent background.

Purpose and Goal\n\nThe Home page is the primary entry point for all visitors. Its goal is to immediately convey the purpose and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), establishing credibility and motivating developers to explore the tool and the underlying philosophy of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n## 2\\. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  * **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple).\n  * **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  * Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  * Logo on the left, navigation links (Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  * **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component in the `automationsaas` context) to add depth.\n  * **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  * **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  * **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  * **Visual:** The centerpiece will be the `dce-hero-screenshot.png` (A15, AS-03), presented within a stylized container (like the `ContainerScroll` component from AutomationSaaS) to give it a dynamic, engaging feel.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution\n\n  * **Layout:** A two-column or alternating layout highlighting the inefficiencies of standard AI workflows and how DCE solves them.\n  * **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools. Start Building the Future.\"\n  * **Points (Visualized with Icons from A15):**\n      * **Problem:** Manual context management is slow and error-prone. **Solution (Icon AS-04):** DCE provides intuitive, visual context curation directly in VS Code.\n      * **Problem:** Testing AI suggestions is risky and time-consuming. **Solution (Icon AS-05):** The Parallel Co-Pilot enables rapid, side-by-side comparison and safe, Git-integrated testing.\n      * **Problem:** AI collaboration lacks structure and auditability. **Solution (Icon AS-06):** DCE captures the entire development process as an iterative, auditable knowledge graph.\n\n### 4.4. Section 3: The DCE Workflow Visualization (Interactive Element)\n\n  * **Layout:** A visually engaging section dedicated to showing the DCE in action.\n  * **Headline:** \"The Power of Iteration: See the DCE Workflow\"\n  * **Visual:** This section will prominently feature the `pcp.gif` provided by the curator. The GIF, which demonstrates the full workflow from opening a workspace to parsing multiple AI responses, will be the central focus. It should be displayed in a high-quality format, possibly within a stylized container that resembles a monitor or a VS Code window.\n  * **Asset Path:** `public/assets/videos/pcp.gif` (Curator to provide and place file here).\n\n### 4.5. Section 4: The Mission (Cognitive Capitalism)\n\n  * **Layout:** A more text-focused section with a strong visual anchor (perhaps utilizing the `LampComponent` aesthetic from `automationsaas` for dramatic lighting).\n  * **Headline:** \"More Than Code: The Rise of Cognitive Capitalism.\"\n  * **Content:** A brief, compelling summary of the strategic vision—that mastering AI collaboration is essential for competitiveness and individual empowerment. This section connects the tool (DCE) to the broader mission (combating AI centralization and domination policies).\n  * **CTA:** \"Read Our Mission\" (Links to `/mission`).\n\n### 4.6. Footer\n\n  * Standard site footer (from `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`).\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx\">\n'use client'\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react'\nimport { useScroll, useTransform, motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nexport const ContainerScroll = ({\n  titleComponent,\n  children,\n}: {\n  titleComponent: string | React.ReactNode\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) => {\n  const containerRef = useRef<any>(null)\n  const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({\n    target: containerRef,\n  })\n  const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = React.useState(false)\n\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    const checkMobile = () => {\n      setIsMobile(window.innerWidth <= 768)\n    }\n    checkMobile()\n    window.addEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\n    return () => {\n      window.removeEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\n    }\n  }, [])\n\n  const scaleDimensions = () => {\n    return isMobile ?

          "content": "<summary>\nOkay, I'm ready for Cycle 3. My course of action is to tackle the three main requests: implementing the new home page design, creating a suite of artifacts for image generation prompts, and updating the home page design to incorporate the provided `pcp.gif`.\n\nFirst, I will create a master system prompt for image generation (A15.1), modeled after the successful `A179` from the `aiascentgame` context, to establish a consistent aesthetic. Following that, I will generate individual prompt artifacts for each required asset listed in the wishlist (A15), from the logo and favicon to the specific icons for the features section. I will also update the Master Artifact List (A0) to catalog these new documents.\n\nNext, I will update the Home Page Design artifact (A16) to explicitly include the `pcp.gif` in the \"Workflow Visualization\" section, ensuring the documentation reflects the plan before implementation.\n\nFinally, I will execute the home page implementation (T-3 from A4). This involves porting over several complex UI components from the `automationsaas` project (`ContainerScroll`, `Sparkles`, and `Lamp`) and creating the new section components (`HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, `MissionSection`). I will then integrate these into the main `page.tsx` to bring the new design to life, replacing the placeholder content from Cycle 1.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create Image Generation System Prompt (A15.1):** Adapt the `A179` artifact from the `aiascentgame` context to create a new master system prompt (`A15.1`) for generating all visual assets for `aiascent.dev`.\n2.  **Create Individual Image Prompts (A15.2-A15.7):** Generate a new artifact for each required asset in A15, containing the specific text prompt for the image generation AI. This includes the logo, favicon, feature icons, and OG image.\n3.  **Update Master Artifact List (A0):** Add the newly created A15.x artifacts to `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md` to keep the project documentation synchronized.\n4.  **Update Home Page Design (A16):** Modify `A16-Page-Design-Home.md` to incorporate the user's `pcp.gif` into the \"Workflow Visualization\" section, ensuring the design document accurately reflects this new requirement.\n5.  **Port UI Components from AutomationSaaS:** Recreate the `ContainerScroll`, `Sparkles`, and `Lamp` components from the `automationsaas` context as new files within the `aiascent.dev` project to be used on the home page.\n6.  **Implement Home Page Sections:** Create the new React components for each section of the home page as defined in the updated A16: `HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, and `MissionSection`.\n7.  **Integrate Home Page:** Update `src/app/page.tsx` to import and render the new home page section components, replacing the current placeholder content.\n8.  **Update Task Checklist (A4):** Mark sub-tasks of T-3 as in-progress or complete in `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\">\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C3 (Add image generation prompt artifacts A15.1-A15.7)\n\n## 1\\.

Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets for the `aiascent.dev` website. Its goal is to establish a consistent aesthetic and thematic direction for the image generation AI, ensuring that all logos, icons, and images contribute to the project's professional and sophisticated brand identity. This artifact is modeled on the successful `A179. RDS - Image Generation System Prompt.md` from the `aiascent.game` project.\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Digital Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and branding specialist with a deep understanding of user interface design, iconography, and developer tool aesthetics. Your task is to generate a series of clean, professional, and thematically coherent visual assets for **aiascent.dev**, the promotional website for a VS Code extension called the **Data Curation Environment (DCE)**.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Sophisticated, Modern, and Precise.\"** This reflects the nature of a high-end developer tool.\n    *   **Color Palette:** The primary theme is dark mode. Use a base of near-black or very dark charcoal (`#111827`). The primary accent color is a vibrant, electric blue or cyan (`#22d3ee`), used to convey intelligence, clarity, and energy. Secondary accents can include a cool-toned purple (`#8b5cf6`) or a clean white/light gray for text and highlights.\n    *   **Style:** The style should be clean, minimalist, and often abstract or symbolic. For icons, think vector-based, flat, or subtly 2.5D designs. Avoid overly complex or realistic imagery unless specifically requested. The overall feeling should be professional, trustworthy, and futuristic.\n    *   **Lighting & Effects:** Use subtle gradients, soft glows, and sharp lines to create a sense of digital precision and depth. Avoid anything that looks cartoonish or hand-drawn.\n\n2.  **Embrace the Core Metaphor:** The DCE is a tool for **\"Citizen Architects\"**—developers who build complex systems with AI. Your visuals should evoke themes of:\n    *   **Structure & Architecture:** Grids, blueprints, interconnected nodes, layers.\n    *   **Clarity & Focus:** Magnifying glasses, lenses, highlighted text or code, clean interfaces.\n    *   **Workflow & Iteration:** Circular arrows, branching paths, gears, process diagrams.\n    *   **Human-AI Collaboration:** Abstract representations of a human mind and a digital network intertwining.\n\n3.  **Prioritize Clarity and Scalability:**\n    *   **Icons:** Must be instantly recognizable and legible at small sizes. They should be designed as SVGs with clean lines and a limited color palette. They must work on a dark background.\n    *   **Logos:** Must be simple, memorable, and scalable. The design should encapsulate the core concept of the brand.\n    *   **Images:** Should be high-resolution and composed with clear focal points.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific request for a visual asset (e.g., \"an icon for 'Context Curation'\"). You will apply the **Master Aesthetic** and the **Core Metaphor** to generate a single, high-quality asset that perfectly fits the `aiascent.dev` brand identity. You will focus on fulfilling the specific prompt while ensuring it aligns with the overall design system established here.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Prompt-Logo.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Prompt: Logo\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, logo, asset\n\n## 1.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis cycle (C3) focuses on two main areas: establishing a robust system for generating visual assets and beginning the implementation of the homepage (T-3), leveraging dynamic components from the `automationsaas` template.\n\n**1. Image Generation System:**\nI have created the foundational artifacts for image generation. This includes `A15.1` (Master System Prompt), which defines the aesthetic direction (Sophisticated, Futuristic, Solarpunk-inspired) and guidelines for the image generation AI. I then created individual prompt artifacts (A15.2-A15.6) for the logo, favicon, and the three core feature icons. A15 (Asset Wishlist) has been updated to link to these prompts and to include the new `pcp.gif` asset provided by the curator. A0 (Master Artifact List) has been updated to include these new artifacts.\n\n**2. Homepage Design Update:**\nI updated A16 (Page Design: Home) to incorporate the `pcp.gif`. The most impactful place for this GIF is the Hero section, replacing the static screenshot. This immediately demonstrates the dynamic nature of the DCE.\n\n**3. Homepage Implementation (T-3):**\nI began the implementation of the homepage as outlined in A4, Task T-3.\n\n  * **Ported Dynamic Components:** I ported the `ContainerScroll`, `LampComponent`, and `3d-card` components from the `automationsaas` context into `src/components/global`. These will be used to create the visually engaging sections defined in A16.\n  * **Created Section Components:** I created the foundational structure for the main homepage sections: `HeroSection.tsx`, `FeaturesSection.tsx`, and `MissionSection.tsx`.\n  * **Implementation:**\n      * `HeroSection` utilizes the `ContainerScroll` component to display the main visual (currently using the static screenshot as a placeholder until the GIF is placed by the curator) and the primary CTAs.\n      * `FeaturesSection` implements the three-column layout highlighting the core benefits of the DCE, using the placeholder icons.\n      * `MissionSection` utilizes the `LampComponent` for a dramatic visual presentation of the strategic vision.\n  * **Integration:** These sections have been integrated into `src/app/page.tsx`, replacing the placeholder content from C1.\n  * **Layout Refinements:** The `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` have been updated with refined styling and navigation links corresponding to the planned pages (A16-A19).\n\nFinally, I updated the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to reflect the progress on T-3.\n\n**Files Updated/Created:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.2-Prompt-Logo.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.3-Prompt-Favicon.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.4-Prompt-Icon-Context-Curation.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.5-Prompt-Icon-Parallel-Copilot.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.6-Prompt-Icon-Iterative-Workflow.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/3d-card.tsx (New - Ported)\n  * src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx (New - Ported)\n  * src/components/global/lamp.tsx (New - Ported)\n  * src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Create A15.1 (Master System Prompt):** Define the aesthetic guidelines based on A16 and the structure of A179 (from `aiascentgame` context).\n2.  **Update A15 (Asset Wishlist):** Add the `pcp.gif` asset and link existing assets to their new prompt artifacts.\n3.  **Create A15.X Artifacts:** Generate individual prompt artifacts (A15.2-A15.6) for the logo, favicon, and icons.\n4.  **Update A0 (Master Artifact List):** Register the new A15.X artifacts.\n5.  **Update A16 (Page Design: Home):** Modify the Hero section (4.2) to utilize the `pcp.gif` instead of the static screenshot for maximum impact.\n6.  **Port Dynamic Components:** Copy `ContainerScroll`, `LampComponent`, and `3d-card` from `automationsaas` context (M7) to `src/components/global`.\n7.  **Create Homepage Section Components:** Create `HeroSection.tsx`, `FeaturesSection.tsx`, and `MissionSection.tsx` in `src/components/home`.\n8.  **Implement HeroSection:** Utilize `ContainerScroll` and the main visual (placeholder for GIF/screenshot).\n9.  **Implement FeaturesSection:** Implement the three-column layout with icons.\n10. **Implement MissionSection:** Utilize `LampComponent`.\n11. **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** Integrate the new section components.\n12. **Update Layout Components:** Refine `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` styling and navigation links.\n13. **Update A4 (Task Checklist):** Mark T-3 as \"In Progress\" and update sub-tasks.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\n\n1.  **Place GIF Asset:** Please place the `pcp.gif` file into the `public/assets/images/` directory.

Purpose\n\nThis document provides the master system prompt for generating all visual assets for aiascent.dev. Its goal is to establish a consistent aesthetic that reflects the sophistication, precision, and visionary nature of the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. The Master System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The AIAscent Aesthetic**\n\nYou are an expert digital artist and UI/UX designer tasked with creating visual assets for **aiascent.dev**, the promotional website for a sophisticated developer tool called the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** The aesthetic is **Modern, Professional, Futuristic, and Precise**. The website uses a dark-mode-first design philosophy.\n\n      * **Color Palette:** Dominated by dark backgrounds (deep navy, charcoal, or black) with vibrant, futuristic accents. Primary accents should be electric blue, cyan, and deep purple. Use white or light gray for contrast and text.\n      * **Style:** Clean, minimalist, and high-tech. Think of the interfaces seen in advanced engineering software or sophisticated visualization tools. Use sharp lines, subtle gradients, and occasional holographic or glowing effects to suggest advanced technology.\n      * **Inspiration:** Draw inspiration from the clean lines of modern developer tools (like VS Code or Linear) combined with the optimistic, technologically advanced aspects of **Solarpunk** design (clean energy, integration, empowerment).\n\n2.  **Asset Type Specific Guidelines:**\n\n      * **Icons (SVG):**\n\n          * Icons must be simple, recognizable, and scalable.\n          * Use a consistent line weight.\n          * They should primarily use the accent colors (blue, cyan, purple) against the dark background.\n          * Avoid excessive detail; focus on clear communication of the concept.\n\n      * **Logos & Wordmarks (SVG):**\n\n          * The logo should be sleek and professional.\n          * It must work well in both full color and monochrome (e.g., solid white).\n          * The design should evoke themes of ascent, precision, data, or architecture.\n\n      * **Illustrations/Images (PNG/WEBP):**\n\n          * Images should be cinematic and visually rich, adhering to the color palette.\n          * They should convey the power and impact of the DCE tool.\n          * Use realistic lighting, even when depicting futuristic concepts.\n\n3.  **Thematic Consistency:** Ensure all assets feel like they belong to the same ecosystem. The visuals should reinforce the core message of the DCE: empowering developers (\"Citizen Architects\") to master the human-AI workflow.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with specific prompts for individual assets. For each prompt, you will apply this Master Aesthetic and the relevant Asset Type Specific Guidelines to generate the visual asset.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15: aiascent.dev - Asset Wishlist and Directory Structure\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C3 (Link prompt artifacts A15.X and add pcp.gif)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A list of required visual assets (images, icons, logos) for the aiascent.dev website and the definitive structure for the `public/assets` directory.\n  - **Tags:** assets, wishlist, design, images, icons, file structure\n\n## 1\\.

Also, update the Hero section visual description (4.2) to mention the `dce-hero-screenshot.png`.\n2.  **Generate A15.1 (Master Image Prompt):** Create the master system prompt for image generation, adapting the style from `aiascentgame` (A179) to the `aiascent.dev` aesthetic.\n3.  **Generate Individual Image Prompts (A15.2 - A15.6):** Create specific prompts for the remaining assets in A15 (Logo, Icons, OG Image).\n4.  **Update A0 and A15:** Update the Master Artifact List (A0) with the new A15.x artifacts and update A15 to reflect the status of the assets and the new GIF.\n5.  **Port Dynamic Components (T-3):** Copy the necessary advanced UI components from the `automationsaas` context (M7) into the `aiascent.dev` project (`src/components/global`). This includes `ContainerScroll`, `SparklesCore`, `LampComponent`, and `3d-card`.\n6.  **Implement Home Page Sections (T-3):** Create the new home page section components (`HeroSection.tsx`, `FeaturesSection.tsx`, `WorkflowVisualization.tsx`, `MissionSection.tsx`) based on the updated A16, utilizing the newly ported dynamic components.\n7.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx` (T-3):** Integrate the new section components into the main landing page.\n8.  **Update Header and Footer (T-3):** Refine the styling and add the navigation links (Learn, Mission) defined in the planning artifacts.\n9.  **Update A4 (Task Checklist):** Mark T-3 as in progress.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A16: aiascent.dev - Page Design: Home (Landing Page)\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C3 (Incorporate pcp.gif into Workflow Visualization and refine Hero visual)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Detailed design blueprint for the main landing page (Home) of aiascent.dev, focusing on the value proposition, aesthetics, and user engagement.\n  - **Tags:** page design, home page, landing page, ui, ux, dce, citizen architect\n\n## 1\\. Purpose and Goal\n\nThe Home page is the primary entry point for all visitors. Its goal is to immediately convey the purpose and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), establishing credibility and motivating developers to explore the tool and the underlying philosophy of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n## 2\\. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  \\* **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple).\n  \\* **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  \\* Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  \\* Logo on the left, navigation links (Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component in the `automationsaas` context) to add depth.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  \\* **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  \\* **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  \\* **Visual:** The centerpiece will be the `dce-hero-screenshot.png` (A15, AS-03). This screenshot shows the DCE in action (FTV and PCPP panes open). It will be presented within a stylized container (like the `ContainerScroll` component from AutomationSaaS) to give it a dynamic, engaging feel.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A two-column or alternating layout highlighting the inefficiencies of standard AI workflows and how DCE solves them.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools. Start Building the Future.\"\n  \\* **Points (Visualized with Icons from A15):**\n      \\* **Problem:** Manual context management is slow and error-prone. **Solution (Icon AS-04):** DCE provides intuitive, visual context curation directly in VS Code.\n      \\* **Problem:** Testing AI suggestions is risky and time-consuming. **Solution (Icon AS-05):** The Parallel Co-Pilot enables rapid, side-by-side comparison and safe, Git-integrated testing.\n      \\* **Problem:** AI collaboration lacks structure and auditability. **Solution (Icon AS-06):** DCE captures the entire development process as an iterative, auditable knowledge graph.\n\n### 4.4. Section 3: The DCE Workflow Visualization (Interactive Element)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A visually engaging section demonstrating the workflow in real-time.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"The Power of Iteration: The DCE Workflow in Action\"\n  \\* **Concept (Updated C3):** Instead of a static diagram, we will feature the `pcp.gif` (A15, AS-08). This animated GIF runs through a complete DCE cycle: opening a workspace, onboarding, and pasting/parsing 4 responses.\n  \\* **Presentation:** The GIF should be prominently displayed, perhaps within a stylized browser or VS Code window mockup, with surrounding text explaining the steps shown in the animation.\n\n### 4.5. Section 4: The Mission (Cognitive Capitalism)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A more text-focused section with a strong visual anchor (perhaps utilizing the `LampComponent` aesthetic from `automationsaas` for dramatic lighting).\n  \\* **Headline:** \"More Than Code: The Rise of Cognitive Capitalism.\"\n  \\* **Content:** A brief, compelling summary of the strategic vision—that mastering AI collaboration is essential for competitiveness and individual empowerment. This section connects the tool (DCE) to the broader mission (combating AI centralization and domination policies).\n  \\* **CTA:** \"Read Our Mission\" (Links to `/mission`).\n\n### 4.6. Footer\n\n  \\* Standard site footer (from `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`).\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.1-Master-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15.1: aiascent.dev - Master Image Generation System Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** The master system prompt used to guide AI image generation for aiascent.dev, ensuring a consistent, professional, and sophisticated aesthetic suitable for developer tools.\n  - **Tags:** assets, design, images, prompt engineering, system prompt, aesthetic\n\n## 1\\. Purpose\n\nThis document provides the master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets (icons, logos, promotional images) for the aiascent.dev website. Its goal is to establish a consistent aesthetic that reflects the nature of the Data Curation Environment (DCE) as a sophisticated, precise, and modern developer tool.\n\n## 2\\. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The DCE Aesthetic**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and UI/UX specialist tasked with creating visual assets for `aiascent.dev`, the promotional website for a high-end Visual Studio Code extension called the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** The guiding aesthetic is **Sophisticated, Precise, and Modern Minimalism**. The visuals should evoke the feeling of advanced developer tooling.\n\n      * **Color Palette:** Primarily monochromatic (blacks, whites, shades of gray) with strategic use of a single, vibrant accent color for highlights and calls to action. The preferred accent is **Electric Blue** or **Cyan**. Avoid overly busy gradients or rainbow palettes.\n      * **Typography (for Logos/OG Images):** Clean, modern, sans-serif fonts.\n      * **Style:** Flat design, line art, or subtle 3D isometric elements are acceptable. Avoid photorealism (unless specifically requested for screenshots), cartoons, or overly ornate styles.\n\n2.  **Asset Type Specific Guidelines:**\n\n      * **Icons (SVG):**\n\n          * Must be simple, clear, and immediately recognizable.\n          * Use a consistent line weight.\n          * Should work well at small sizes (e.g., 24x24px).\n          * The output must be clean SVG code. Do not wrap the SVG code in markdown code blocks (e.g., ` svg ...  `).\n\n      * **Logos (SVG):**\n\n          * Should combine typography with a simple, abstract symbol representing concepts like \"curation,\" \"iteration,\" or \"AI collaboration.\"\n          * Must be versatile enough to work on both dark and light backgrounds.\n          * The output must be clean SVG code. Do not wrap the SVG code in markdown code blocks.\n\n      * **Promotional/OG Images (PNG/WEBP):**\n\n          * Should be high-resolution (1200x630px for OG images).\n          * Combine the logo, a compelling headline, and a subtle background visual that reinforces the aesthetic (e.g., a dark background with a faint circuit pattern or data visualization).\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific `<Asset Request>` detailing the asset needed. You will apply the Master Aesthetic and the Asset Type Specific Guidelines to generate the requested visual asset.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt: Logo (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** The specific prompt used to generate the main logo for aiascent.dev (Asset AS-01).\n  - **Tags:** assets, design, images, prompt engineering, logo\n\n## 1\\.

The aesthetic should be dark, modern, and professional. All sections (Hero, Features, Workflow, Mission) should be present. The `ContainerScroll` and `LampComponent` should render correctly. The `pcp.gif` should display in the Workflow section.\n\n## T-4: Interactive Showcase Implementation (Cycle 4+)\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`\n        - `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`\n        - `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`\n\n  - **Total Tokens:** \\~10,000+\n\n  - **More than one cycle?** Yes\n\n  - **Status:** To Do\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 4.1):** Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` layout based on the design in A17 (Introduction, Component, Meta-Commentary).\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 4.2):** Enhance the core logic and styling for the `InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx` component (e.g., adding a Table of Contents sidebar).\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 4.3):** (Curator Task) Populate `whitepaperContent.json` with actual content (the placeholder is currently minimal).\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1.  Navigate to `/showcase`.\n2.  **Expected:** The page layout should match A17. The interactive component should function correctly with the available data.\n\n## T-5: Plan for Next Cycle\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 5.1):** Review progress, update this checklist, and prioritize tasks for the subsequent cycle.\n\n-----\n\n## Completed Tasks\n\n## T-2: Strategic Planning and Asset Management (Cycle 2)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C2)\n\n## T-1: Project Scaffolding (Cycle 1)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C1)\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<summary\\>\nThis cycle focused on executing the user's requests: generating image prompts for the required assets and implementing the core structure of the home page (T-3).\n\n**Image Prompt Generation (A15):**\nI successfully created the Master Image Generation System Prompt (A15.1), establishing the aesthetic guidelines for the project. I then generated individual prompts for the Logo (A15.2), the three core feature icons (A15.3-A15.5), and the OG Image (A15.6). The Master Artifact List (A0) was updated to include these new documents.\n\n**Homepage Implementation (T-3):**\nBefore implementation, I updated the Homepage Design (A16) to incorporate the user-provided `pcp.gif` into the Workflow Visualization section, ensuring the design reflected all requirements. I also updated the Asset Wishlist (A15) to include the GIF.\n\nI then ported several advanced UI components from the `automationsaas` context: `3d-card.tsx`, `container-scroll-animation.tsx`, and `lamp.tsx`. These were adapted slightly to fit the `aiascent.dev` theming system.\n\nThe main sections of the home page were implemented as new components:\n\n  * `HeroSection.tsx`: Utilizes the `ContainerScroll` component to display the headline and the `dce-hero-screenshot.png`.\n  * `FeaturesSection.tsx`: A clean, card-based layout highlighting the core benefits.\n  * `WorkflowVisualization.tsx`: Features the `pcp.gif` with accompanying explanatory text.\n  * `MissionSection.tsx`: Utilizes the `LampContainer` for a dramatic presentation of the project's mission.\n\nThese components were integrated into `src/app/page.tsx`. Furthermore, the `Header.tsx` was updated with the correct navigation links (Learn, Mission), and placeholder pages for these routes were created.\n\nThe project now has a visually rich and structured landing page aligned with the design vision.\n\n**Files Updated/Created:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.1-Master-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.3-Image-Prompt-Icon-Context-Curation.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.4-Image-Prompt-Icon-Parallel-Copilot.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.5-Image-Prompt-Icon-Iterative-Workflow.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.6-Image-Prompt-OG-Image.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/learn/page.tsx (New)\n  * src/app/mission/page.tsx (New)\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/3d-card.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/lamp.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/card.tsx\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\n\n1.  **Generate Images:** Please take the prompts generated in A15.2 through A15.6 and use your preferred image generation tool to create the corresponding assets. Place the generated files in the locations specified in A15 (e.g., `public/assets/logo.svg`, `public/assets/icons/context-curation.svg`, etc.).\n2.  **Place `pcp.gif`:** Please place the `pcp.gif` file you mentioned into `public/assets/images/pcp.gif`.

        "12": {
          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis cycle (C3) focuses on two main areas: establishing the visual identity pipeline and implementing the core structure of the Home page (T-3).\n\nFirst, I addressed the visual assets. I updated the Asset Wishlist (A15) to include the `pcp.gif` provided by the curator and updated the Home Page Design (A16) to utilize this GIF in the Hero section for a dynamic visualization of the DCE. I then created the Master Image Generation System Prompt (A15.1), defining the aesthetic direction—\"Algorithmic Elegance\"—which blends the precision of code with the sophistication of modern design. Following this guide, I generated specific prompts for the Logo (A15.2) and the core feature icons (A15.3, A15.4, A15.5), and updated the Master Artifact List (A0).\n\nSecond, I began the implementation of the Home Page (T-3). To leverage the stylized components from the `automationsaas` context, I ported over several key dynamic components: `3d-card.tsx`, `container-scroll-animation.tsx`, `lamp.tsx`, and `sparkles.tsx` into `src/components/global`.\n\nI then created the main sections of the home page:\n\n  - `HeroSection.tsx`: Utilizes the `ContainerScroll` component to dynamically display the `pcp.gif`, immediately showcasing the DCE in action.\n  - `FeaturesSection.tsx`: A clear, icon-driven section highlighting the core benefits of the DCE.\n  - `MissionSection.tsx`: Uses the visually striking `LampComponent` to introduce the strategic vision.\n  - `WorkflowVisualization.tsx`: A placeholder component for the workflow diagram.\n\nThese sections were integrated into `src/app/page.tsx`, replacing the previous placeholder content. I also updated the `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` to align with the navigation structure defined in the design artifacts.\n\nFinally, I updated the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to reflect the completion of the initial Home Page implementation.\n\n**Files Updated:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.1-Master-Image-System-Prompt.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.3-Image-Prompt-Icon-Context-Curation.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.4-Image-Prompt-Icon-Parallel-Copilot.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.5-Image-Prompt-Icon-Iterative-Workflow.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/3d-card.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/lamp.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/sparkles.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Update A16 (Home Page Design):** Modify Section 4.2 to incorporate the `pcp.gif` as the primary visual in the Hero section, replacing the static screenshot.\n2.  **Update A15 (Asset Wishlist):** Add `pcp.gif` to the wishlist and update the entry for the static screenshot.\n3.  **Generate A15.1 (Master Image System Prompt):** Create the new artifact defining the \"Algorithmic Elegance\" aesthetic for `aiascent.dev`.\n4.  **Generate A15.2 (Logo Prompt):** Create the prompt artifact for the main logo.\n5.  **Generate A15.3 (Icon Prompt - Context Curation):** Create the prompt artifact for the context curation icon.\n6.  **Generate A15.4 (Icon Prompt - Parallel Co-Pilot):** Create the prompt artifact for the parallel co-pilot icon.\n7.  **Generate A15.5 (Icon Prompt - Iterative Workflow):** Create the prompt artifact for the iterative workflow icon.\n8.  **Update A0 (Master Artifact List):** Register the new A15.X artifacts.\n9.  **Port `ContainerScroll` Component:** Copy `container-scroll-animation.tsx` from `automationsaas` context to `src/components/global/`.\n10. **Port `LampComponent` and Dependencies:** Copy `lamp.tsx` and `sparkles.tsx` from `automationsaas` context to `src/components/global/`.\n11. **Port `3d-card` Component:** Copy `3d-card.tsx` from `automationsaas` context to `src/components/global/`.\n12. **Implement `HeroSection.tsx`:** Create the Hero section component, integrating `ContainerScroll` and the `pcp.gif`.\n13. **Implement `FeaturesSection.tsx`:** Create the Features section component using the icon placeholders.\n14. **Implement `MissionSection.tsx`:** Create the Mission section component, integrating `LampComponent`.\n15. **Implement `WorkflowVisualization.tsx`:** Create a basic/placeholder implementation for the workflow visualization.\n16. **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** Integrate the new home page components.\n17. **Update `Header.tsx`:** Update navigation links (Home, Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub).\n18. **Update `Footer.tsx`:** Refine footer content and links.\n19. **Update A4 (Task Checklist):** Mark T-3 initial implementation as complete.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\n\n1.  **Asset Placement:** Please ensure the `pcp.gif` file is placed in the location specified in the updated A15: `public/assets/images/pcp-workflow.gif`.\n2.  **Image Generation:** Please take the prompts generated in A15.2 through A15.5 and use your preferred image generation tool (e.g., Nano Banana, Midjourney, DALL-E 3) to create the corresponding SVG assets.

Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  \\* **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple). The aesthetic is defined as \"Algorithmic Elegance\" (See A15.1).\n  \\* **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  \\* Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  \\* Logo on the left, navigation links (Home, Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component) to add depth.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  \\* **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  \\* **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  \\* **Visual (Updated C3):** The centerpiece will be the `pcp-workflow.gif` (A15, AS-08), an animation demonstrating the full DCE workflow. This will be presented within a stylized container (like the `ContainerScroll` component) to give it a dynamic, engaging feel and immediately show the tool in action.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A three-column grid layout highlighting the core features of the DCE.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools. Start Building the Future.\"\n  \\* **Points (Visualized with Icons from A15):**\n      \\* **Context Curation (Icon AS-04):** Intuitive, visual context curation directly in VS Code. Eliminate manual file management and ensure prompt precision.\n      \\* **Parallel Co-Pilot (Icon AS-05):** Generate, compare, and test multiple AI solutions simultaneously. Transform \"accept/reject\" into strategic selection.\n      \\* **Iterative Workflow (Icon AS-06):** A structured, cycle-based approach with Git integration for rapid iteration, safe testing, and auditable development history.\n\n### 4.4. Section 3: The DCE Workflow Visualization (Interactive Element)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A visually engaging, potentially interactive diagram illustrating the DCE cycle.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"The Power of Iteration: The DCE Workflow\"\n  \\* **Concept:** A stylized visualization showing the steps: 1. Curate Context -\\> 2. Generate Prompt -\\> 3. Parallel AI Responses -\\> 4. Test & Select -\\> 5. Integrate & Commit.\n  \\* *UI Idea:* Use subtle animations or hover effects to highlight each step of the workflow.\n\n### 4.5. Section 4: The Mission (Cognitive Capitalism)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A more text-focused section with a strong visual anchor (utilizing the `LampComponent` aesthetic for dramatic lighting).\n  \\* **Headline:** \"More Than Code: The Rise of Cognitive Capitalism.\"\n  \\* **Content:** A brief, compelling summary of the strategic vision—that mastering AI collaboration is essential for competitiveness and individual empowerment. This section connects the tool (DCE) to the broader mission (combating AI centralization and domination policies).\n  \\* **CTA:** \"Read Our Mission\" (Links to `/mission`).\n\n### 4.6. Footer\n\n  \\* Standard site footer (from `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`).\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15: aiascent.dev - Asset Wishlist and Directory Structure\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C3 (Add pcp.gif and update status)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A list of required visual assets (images, icons, logos) for the aiascent.dev website and the definitive structure for the `public/assets` directory.\n  - **Tags:** assets, wishlist, design, images, icons, file structure\n\n## 1\\.

Purpose\n\nThis document provides the master system prompt to guide AI image generation tools in creating a consistent, sophisticated, and thematically coherent visual identity for the aiascent.dev website.\n\n## 2\\. The System Prompt: Algorithmic Elegance\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Aesthetic of Algorithmic Elegance**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and digital artist specializing in branding for high-end developer tools and futuristic technology platforms. Your task is to generate visual assets (logos, icons, illustrations) for `aiascent.dev`, the home of the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n**Your Guiding Aesthetic: Algorithmic Elegance**\n\n\"Algorithmic Elegance\" is the fusion of mathematical precision, the fluidity of advanced AI, and the sophistication of modern minimalist design. It should evoke the feeling of powerful, intelligent tools that enhance human capability.\n\n**Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Color Palette:** The primary aesthetic is **dark-mode-first**.\n\n      * **Backgrounds:** Deep blacks (\\#000000), dark charcoals (\\#1E1E1E), and midnight blues (\\#0A0F1A).\n      * **Accents (The \"Digital Glow\"):** Use vibrant, futuristic accent colors for highlights, lines, and focal points.\n          * Electric Blue (\\#007BFF)\n          * Cyan / Teal (\\#00FFFF)\n          * Deep Violet (\\#6A0DAD)\n      * **Neutrals:** Use cool grays (\\#A0AEC0) sparingly for secondary elements.\n\n2.  **Style and Form:**\n\n      * **Minimalism and Precision:** Favor clean lines, geometric shapes, and uncluttered compositions. Every element must feel intentional and precise, like well-written code.\n      * **Vector Focus:** All assets (logos, icons) must be generated as clean, scalable SVGs.\n      * **The \"Holographic\" Effect:** When depicting interfaces or abstract concepts, use subtle gradients, transparency, and glowing edges to suggest advanced, holographic technology. Avoid skeumorphism.\n      * **Data Visualization Motifs:** Integrate abstract motifs inspired by data visualization, networks, file trees, and branching paths (representing the iterative workflow).\n\n3.  **Thematic Resonance (The Citizen Architect):**\n\n      * The visuals should convey empowerment, intelligence, and mastery. The user is the \"Citizen Architect,\" and the tools are extensions of their intellect.\n      * Evoke themes of structure, iteration, and the human-AI partnership.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with specific requests for assets (e.g., \"Logo for aiascent.dev\" or \"Icon for Context Curation\"). You will interpret these requests through the lens of Algorithmic Elegance, adhering strictly to the color palette, style directives, and thematic resonance defined above. Generate the asset as a clean SVG.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt: Logo\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** The specific prompt for generating the main logo (AS-01) for aiascent.dev, following the \"Algorithmic Elegance\" aesthetic.\n  - **Tags:** assets, design, prompt engineering, logo\n\n## 1\\.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis cycle focuses on executing the Home Page implementation (T-3 in A4) and addressing the user's requests regarding asset generation prompts and incorporating the new `pcp.gif`.\n\nFirst, I updated the Home Page Design (A16) to incorporate the `pcp.gif` alongside the existing screenshot in the Hero section, utilizing the dynamic `ContainerScroll` component for presentation.\n\nNext, I created the requested image generation prompt artifacts (A15.1 through A15.7). A15.1 defines the master system prompt, establishing the aesthetic guidelines for all generated images, drawing inspiration from the `aiascentgame` context (A179) but tailored to the professional aesthetic of `aiascent.dev`. The subsequent artifacts provide specific prompts for the logo, favicon, feature icons, and the OG image. I also updated the Master Artifact List (A0) to include these new documents.\n\nFor the implementation (T-3), I began by importing the necessary dynamic UI components from the `automationsaas` context (`ContainerScroll`, `LampComponent`, `SparklesCore`, `3d-card`, `InfiniteMovingCards`) into `src/components/global`. I then updated `tailwind.config.ts` to include the required animations and keyframes for these components.\n\nI implemented the core structure of the home page by creating the section components (`HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowSection`, `MissionSection`) in `src/components/home` and integrating them into `src/app/page.tsx`. The `HeroSection` now uses the `ContainerScroll` component to display the DCE screenshot and the new GIF (assuming it's placed at `public/assets/images/pcp.gif`). The `FeaturesSection` uses the placeholder icons, and the `MissionSection` utilizes the dramatic `LampComponent`.\n\nFinally, I refined the `Header` and `Footer` components to align with the dark, sophisticated aesthetic defined in A16, ensuring a cohesive look across the site. The Universal Task Checklist (A4) has been updated to reflect the completion of these tasks.\n\n**Files Updated/Created:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.1-Master-Image-System-Prompt.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.3-Image-Prompt-Favicon.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.4-Image-Prompt-Icon-ContextCuration.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.5-Image-Prompt-Icon-ParallelCopilot.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.6-Image-Prompt-Icon-IterativeWorkflow.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.7-Image-Prompt-OGImage.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/3d-card.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/infinite-moving-cards.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/lamp.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/sparkles.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n  * tailwind.config.ts\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Update A16 (Home Page Design):** Modify the Hero section design (4.2) to incorporate the `pcp.gif` alongside the screenshot, utilizing the `ContainerScroll` component.\n2.  **Create A15.1 (Master Image System Prompt):** Generate the master system prompt artifact, adapting A179 for the `aiascent.dev` aesthetic.\n3.  **Create A15.X Artifacts (Specific Image Prompts):** Generate individual prompt artifacts (A15.2 - A15.7) for the logo, favicon, icons, and OG image listed in A15.\n4.  **Update A0 (Master Artifact List):** Add entries for the new A15.X artifacts.\n5.  **Import Dynamic Components:** Copy `ContainerScroll`, `LampComponent`, `SparklesCore`, `3d-card`, and `InfiniteMovingCards` from the `automationsaas` context into `src/components/global`.\n6.  **Update `tailwind.config.ts`:** Merge the necessary keyframes and animations from the `automationsaas` configuration to support the imported dynamic components.\n7.  **Create Home Page Sections:** Implement `HeroSection.tsx`, `FeaturesSection.tsx`, `WorkflowSection.tsx`, and `MissionSection.tsx` in `src/components/home`.\n8.  **Update Layout Components:** Refine `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` to match the sophisticated, dark aesthetic defined in A16.\n9.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** Integrate the new section components and remove placeholder content.\n10. **Update A4 (Task Checklist):** Mark T-3 as complete and update the plan for the next cycle.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A16: aiascent.dev - Page Design: Home (Landing Page)\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C3 (Incorporate pcp.gif into the Hero section)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Detailed design blueprint for the main landing page (Home) of aiascent.dev, focusing on the value proposition, aesthetics, and user engagement.\n  - **Tags:** page design, home page, landing page, ui, ux, dce, citizen architect\n\n## 1\\. Purpose and Goal\n\nThe Home page is the primary entry point for all visitors. Its goal is to immediately convey the purpose and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), establishing credibility and motivating developers to explore the tool and the underlying philosophy of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n## 2\\. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  \\* **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple). The background should be dark and immersive (e.g., `bg-neutral-950` or similar).\n  \\* **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  \\* Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  \\* The header should be fixed or sticky, with a dark, semi-transparent background (`bg-black/40 backdrop-blur-lg`) to maintain the aesthetic.\n  \\* Logo on the left, navigation links (Home, Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component in the `automationsaas` context) to add depth.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  \\* **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  \\* **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  \\* **Visual (Updated C3):** The centerpiece will utilize the `ContainerScroll` component (from AutomationSaaS) to provide a dynamic, engaging presentation. Inside the ContainerScroll, we will feature a combination of the `dce-hero-screenshot.png` (A15, AS-03) and the `pcp.gif` (located at `public/assets/images/pcp.gif`) to show both the interface and the workflow in action.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution (Features)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A three-column grid of cards (potentially using `3d-card` component for subtle depth).\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools.

Purpose\n\nThis document provides the master system prompt to be used when generating visual assets (icons, logos, illustrations) for the aiascent.dev website. Its goal is to ensure a consistent, high-quality, and thematically coherent visual identity across the entire site.\n\n## 2\\. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The DCE Aesthetic**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and digital artist specializing in creating assets for sophisticated developer tools and strategic platforms. Your task is to generate visual assets for aiascent.dev, the official website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code extension.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** The aesthetic is **Modern, Precise, and Futuristic Minimalism**.\n\n      * **Color Palette:** Primarily monochromatic (blacks, whites, grays) with strategic use of vibrant, futuristic accent colors (Electric Blue, Cyan, Deep Purple). Assets must look excellent on both dark and light backgrounds, but prioritize a **dark-mode-first** appearance.\n      * **Style:** Clean lines, sharp edges, and geometric shapes. Avoid excessive ornamentation, gradients (unless subtle and used for depth), or cartoonish styles. The look should evoke precision engineering, advanced technology, and clarity of thought.\n      * **Themes:** The underlying themes are Human-AI collaboration, workflow efficiency, data management, and the concept of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n2.  **Asset Specific Guidelines:**\n\n      * **Logos & Icons (SVG):**\n\n          * Must be vector-based (SVG).\n          * Must be simple, scalable, and instantly recognizable even at small sizes.\n          * Use solid colors or very subtle gradients.\n          * Ensure paths are clean and optimized.\n\n      * **Illustrations & Hero Images (PNG/WEBP):**\n\n          * Should be high-resolution and professional.\n          * If depicting technology (like screenshots or abstract visualizations), maintain the clean, minimalist aesthetic.\n          * Lighting should be dramatic but clean, often using the accent colors to highlight key elements.\n\n3.  **Thematic Cohesion:** Every asset must reinforce the idea that the DCE is a powerful, professional tool that enhances human intelligence and streamlines complex workflows.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with specific requests for assets (e.g., \"Icon for Context Curation\"). You will apply these Master Aesthetic guidelines to generate the requested asset in the specified format.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15.2: Image Prompt - Logo (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Specific prompt for generating the main logo (AS-01) for aiascent.dev.\n  - **Tags:** assets, design, images, prompt, logo\n\n## 1\\.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis cycle focuses on executing Task T-3 (Homepage Implementation) and generating the necessary image prompts for asset creation, as requested by the curator.\n\nFirst, I addressed the curator's request regarding the `pcp.gif`. I updated the Asset Wishlist (A15) to include it and revised the Home Page Design (A16) to specify that this GIF, demonstrating the DCE workflow, should be the centerpiece of the Hero section, utilized within the `ContainerScroll` component.\n\nNext, I generated the requested image prompts. I created A15.1, the Master System Prompt, defining the aesthetic direction for all visual assets. Following this, I generated specific prompts for the Logo (A15.2), the three feature icons (A15.3-5), and the OG Image (A15.6). The Master Artifact List (A0) has been updated to include these new artifacts.\n\nFor the homepage implementation (T-3), I prepared the environment by updating `package.json` with dependencies required for dynamic UI components (like `framer-motion` and `tsparticles`). I then copied the `ContainerScroll`, `LampComponent`, and `SparklesCore` components from the `automationsaas` context into `src/components/global`.\n\nI implemented the core sections of the homepage: `HeroSection` (utilizing `ContainerScroll` and ready for the GIF), `FeaturesSection` (using placeholder icons), and `MissionSection` (utilizing `LampComponent`). These were integrated into `src/app/page.tsx`, and the Header and Footer were updated to reflect the navigation structure defined in the design artifacts.\n\nFinally, I updated the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to reflect the progress on T-3.\n\n**Files Created/Updated:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.1-Master-Image-System-Prompt.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.2-Prompt-Logo.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.3-Prompt-Icon-Context-Curation.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.4-Prompt-Icon-Parallel-Copilot.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.5-Prompt-Icon-Iterative-Workflow.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.6-Prompt-OG-Image.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\n  * package.json\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/lamp.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/sparkles.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Update A15 (Asset Wishlist):** Add the `pcp.gif` to the asset list (AS-08).\n2.  **Update A16 (Home Page Design):** Modify the Hero section (4.2) to utilize the `pcp.gif` as the primary visual within the `ContainerScroll` component.\n3.  **Generate Image Prompts:**\n      * Create A15.1 (Master System Prompt).\n      * Create A15.2 (Logo Prompt - AS-01).\n      * Create A15.3 (Context Curation Icon Prompt - AS-04).\n      * Create A15.4 (Parallel Co-Pilot Icon Prompt - AS-05).\n      * Create A15.5 (Iterative Workflow Icon Prompt - AS-06).\n      * Create A15.6 (OG Image Prompt - AS-07).\n4.  **Update A0 (Master Artifact List):** Add the new A15.X artifacts.\n5.  **Prepare for Homepage Implementation (T-3):**\n      * Update `package.json` to include `framer-motion`, `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/slim`, `@tsparticles/engine`.\n      * Copy dynamic components from `automationsaas` (M7) to `src/components/global/`:\n          * `container-scroll-animation.tsx`\n          * `lamp.tsx`\n          * `sparkles.tsx`\n6.  **Implement Homepage Sections (T-3):**\n      * Create `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`.\n      * Create `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`.\n      * Create `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`.\n7.  **Update Core Files (T-3):**\n      * Update `src/app/page.tsx` to integrate the new sections.\n      * Update `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` and `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` with refined navigation and styling.\n8.  **Update A4 (Task Checklist):** Mark relevant T-3 tasks as complete and update the plan.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\n\n1.  **Install Dependencies:** Please run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install the new dependencies added to `package.json` (`framer-motion` and `tsparticles` libraries).\n2.  **Place GIF Asset:** Please place the `pcp.gif` file into the `public/assets/images/` directory.

Purpose and Goal\n\nThe Home page is the primary entry point for all visitors. Its goal is to immediately convey the purpose and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), establishing credibility and motivating developers to explore the tool and the underlying philosophy of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n## 2\\. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  \\* **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple).\n  \\* **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  \\* Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  \\* Logo on the left, navigation links (Home, Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component in the `automationsaas` context) to add depth.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  \\* **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  \\* **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  \\* **Visual (Updated C3):** The centerpiece will be the `pcp.gif` (A15, AS-08), an animated demonstration of the DCE workflow. This will be presented within a stylized container (the `ContainerScroll` component from AutomationSaaS) to give it a dynamic, engaging feel.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A three-column grid highlighting the core features and how DCE solves common AI workflow problems.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools. Start Building the Future.\"\n  \\* **Points (Visualized with Icons from A15):**\n      \\* **Feature 1 (Icon AS-04): Precision Context Curation.** Stop manually managing context. DCE provides intuitive, visual file selection directly in VS Code.\n      \\* **Feature 2 (Icon AS-05): The Parallel Co-Pilot.** Don't rely on a single AI response. Rapidly compare multiple solutions side-by-side and test safely with Git integration.\n      \\* **Feature 3 (Icon AS-06): Iterative Knowledge Graph.** Transform your process into an asset. DCE captures the entire development cycle as an auditable knowledge graph.\n\n### 4.4. Section 3: The DCE Workflow Visualization (Interactive Element)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A visually engaging, potentially interactive diagram illustrating the DCE cycle.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"The Power of Iteration: The DCE Workflow\"\n  \\* **Concept:** A stylized visualization showing the steps: 1. Curate Context -\\> 2. Generate Prompt -\\> 3. Parallel AI Responses -\\> 4. Test & Select -\\> 5. Integrate & Commit.\n  \\* *UI Idea:* Use subtle animations or hover effects to highlight each step of the workflow.\n\n### 4.5. Section 4: The Mission (Cognitive Capitalism)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A more text-focused section with a strong visual anchor (utilizing the `LampComponent` aesthetic from `automationsaas` for dramatic lighting).\n  \\* **Headline:** \"More Than Code: The Rise of Cognitive Capitalism.\"\n  \\* **Content:** A brief, compelling summary of the strategic vision—that mastering AI collaboration is essential for competitiveness and individual empowerment. This section connects the tool (DCE) to the broader mission (combating AI centralization and domination policies).\n  \\* **CTA:** \"Read Our Mission\" (Links to `/mission`).\n\n### 4.6. Footer\n\n  \\* Standard site footer (from `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`).\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.1-Master-Image-System-Prompt.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15.1: aiascent.dev - Master Image System Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** The master system prompt defining the aesthetic direction, style, and thematic consistency for all visual assets generated for the aiascent.dev website.\n  - **Tags:** assets, design, prompt engineering, style guide, visual identity\n\n## 1\\. Purpose\n\nThis document provides the master system prompt to be used when generating any visual assets (icons, logos, illustrations) for the aiascent.dev website. Its goal is to ensure a cohesive, professional, and recognizable visual identity that reflects the nature of the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The AIAscent.dev Visual Identity**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer specializing in branding and iconography for sophisticated developer tools. Your task is to generate visual assets for aiascent.dev, the official website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code extension.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** The aesthetic is **Modern, Precise, and Sophisticated**. It should evoke the feeling of high-end development environments (like VS Code, Linear, or modern IDEs).\n\n      * **Color Palette:** Primarily monochromatic with strategic use of vibrant accents. The design must work flawlessly on a dark background (primary focus) but also be adaptable to light backgrounds.\n          * *Primary (Dark Background):* Deep charcoal or near-black (\\#111827 or similar).\n          * *Foreground/Text:* Off-white or light gray (\\#F3F4F6).\n          * *Accents:* Electric Blue (\\#3B82F6), Cyan (\\#06B6D4), or Deep Purple (\\#8B5CF6). Use accents sparingly for highlights, connections, or active states.\n      * **Style:** Clean lines, geometric shapes, and a minimalist approach. Avoid excessive gradients, shadows, or photorealism in iconography. The style is \"flat design 2.0\" – subtle depth without being skeumorphic.\n      * **Typography (For reference in logos/illustrations):** Modern, sans-serif, highly legible (e.g., Inter, Roboto, SF Pro).\n\n2.  **Thematic Resonance:** The visuals should subtly reflect the core concepts of the DCE:\n\n      * **Curation & Precision:** Elements should feel organized, structured, and deliberate.\n      * **Iteration & Workflow:** Use of circular elements, arrows, or branching paths can evoke the iterative cycle.\n      * **Human-AI Collaboration:** Subtle motifs of connection, networks, or dual elements working together.\n\n3.  **Asset Specific Guidelines:**\n\n      * **Icons (SVG):** Must be simple, recognizable at small sizes (e.g., 24x24px), and use the defined color palette. They should be exported as clean SVG code.\n      * **Logos (SVG):** Must be scalable and professional. The logo should convey the name \"AIAscent.dev\" or an abstract symbol representing the project's goals.\n      * **Illustrations/Banners (PNG/WEBP):** Can be more detailed but must maintain the aesthetic. They should look professional and high-tech, avoiding cartoonish or overly playful styles.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with specific requests for assets (e.g., \"Generate the Context Curation Icon\"). You will apply these Master Directives to create the requested asset and provide the output in the specified format (SVG code or image file).\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Prompt-Logo.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15.2: Image Prompt - Logo (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Image generation prompt for the main logo of aiascent.dev (Asset AS-01).\n  - **Tags:** assets, design, prompt, logo, as-01\n\n## 1\\.

My plan is to first address the missing `tsparticles` dependencies, then correct the layout problems, including the header overlay, the large blank space, and the clipped text. I will also update the feature icons to use the provided PNGs and adjust the hero section to focus on a single, more dynamic visual. Finally, I will address the z-index issue causing the sparkles to render in front of the text and apply a visual refresh to the workflow section to make it feel more interactive.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `package.json`:** Add the missing `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/engine`, and `@tsparticles/slim` dependencies to resolve the build errors.\n2.  **Update `src/app/layout.tsx`:** Add top padding to the main layout to prevent the fixed header from overlapping the page content.\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Modify the hero section to resolve the \"split image\" issue by focusing on a single, more dynamic visual (`pcp.gif`). This will also help address the large blank space below the hero section by simplifying the layout structure.\n4.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** Add padding to the section title to prevent text from being cut off. I will also update the image paths to use the provided `.png` icons instead of the placeholder `.svg` files and remove the `invert` class that is not suitable for PNGs.\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** Refactor the static workflow steps into more visually distinct, card-like elements to give them a more interactive appearance, laying the groundwork for future functionality.\n6.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** Fix the stacking order issue by removing the `isolate` class from a container, which will ensure the text content (`z-50`) correctly renders on top of the background sparkle effect (`z-0`).\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.3.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.3.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n```\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/layout.tsx\">\n```tsx\nimport type { Metadata } from \"next\";\nimport { Inter } from \"next/font/google\";\nimport \"./globals.css\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers/theme-provider\";\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/layout/Footer\";\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: [\"latin\"] });\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\ntitle: \"AIAscent.dev | Home of the Data Curation Environment\",\ndescription: \"The official website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.

I will also update the `Image` component `src` paths to use the new `.png` icons (`context-curation.png`, `parallel-copilot.png`, `iterative-workflow.png`) instead of the SVG placeholders.\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** I will enhance the styling of the static workflow visualization to make it appear more like a connected process flow, improving its visual appeal pending future interactivity.\n6.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will review the z-index values within the LampContainer to ensure the sparkles effect renders behind the text content as intended.\n7.  **Add Curator Activity:** I will include instructions for the curator to run `npm install` to install the newly added dependencies.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nRun `npm install` in your terminal to install the new dependencies for the sparkles/particles effect.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/page.tsx\">\n// src/app/page.tsx\n// C4 - Adjust layout for fixed header\nimport HeroSection from \"@/components/home/HeroSection\";\nimport FeaturesSection from \"@/components/home/FeaturesSection\";\nimport WorkflowSection from \"@/components/home/WorkflowSection\";\nimport MissionSection from \"@/components/home/MissionSection\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\nreturn (\n<div className=\"flex flex-col pt-16\">\n<HeroSection />\n\n\n  {/* Added a separator/spacer for visual distinction */}\n  <div className=\"mt-[10rem] md:mt-[18rem]\">\n    <FeaturesSection />\n  </div>\n\n  <WorkflowSection />\n  \n  {/* Mission Section uses LampContainer which handles its own background/layout */}\n  <MissionSection />\n</div>\n\n\n);\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C4 - Refactor to single hero visual (GIF)\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-100px] md:mt-[-50px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            Workflow.\n            <br/>\n            Become a Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

My course of action is to address the dependency issues and the specific UI/UX problems identified in the hero, features, and mission sections of the homepage. This involves installing missing `tsparticles` libraries, correcting layout and spacing issues, updating asset paths to use the new PNG icons, and fixing the layering of the sparkle effects.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`package.json`:** Add the required `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/engine`, and `@tsparticles/slim` dependencies to resolve the TypeScript errors.\n2.  **`src/app/layout.tsx`:** Add top padding to the main content area to prevent the fixed header from overlapping the page content, addressing the issue from screenshot 1.\n3.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Rework the `ContainerScroll` component's content. I will remove the two-column grid and feature the `pcp.gif` as the single, primary visual element to resolve the \"split image\" issue. I will also reduce the overall height of this section to eliminate the large blank space noted in screenshot 2.\n4.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Add bottom padding to the section title (\"Stop Fighting Your Tools...\") to prevent the text from being cut off.\n    *   Update the `features` array to use the `.png` icon files (`context-curation.png`, `parallel-copilot.png`, `iterative-workflow.png`) instead of the previous `.svg` placeholders.\n    *   Remove the `invert` CSS class from the icon `Image` components as it's no longer needed for PNGs.\n5.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** Integrate the `SparklesCore` component directly into this section, placing it in the background behind the main text content to ensure it renders correctly as a backdrop, fixing the layering issue from screenshot 3.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nAfter accepting these file changes, please run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) in your terminal to install the new dependencies added to `package.json`.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/layout.tsx\">\nimport type { Metadata } from \"next\";\nimport { Inter } from \"next/font/google\";\nimport \"./globals.css\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers/theme-provider\";\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/layout/Footer\";\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: [\"latin\"] });\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\ntitle: \"AIAscent.dev | Home of the Data Curation Environment\",\ndescription: \"The official website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.

Finally, I will enhance the visual presentation of the workflow section and ensure the particle effects in the mission section render correctly behind the text.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Add Dependencies:** Update `package.json` to include `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/engine`, and `@tsparticles/slim` to fix the missing module errors.\n2.  **Add Curator Activity:** Create a `<curator_activity>` block to instruct you to run `npm install` to install the new dependencies.\n3.  **Fix Header Overlap:** Modify `HeroSection.tsx` to add top padding, preventing the fixed header from obscuring the main headline.\n4.  **Correct Hero Visuals:** Update `HeroSection.tsx` to simplify the content within the `ContainerScroll` component, removing the two-column grid and focusing on displaying the `pcp.gif` as the primary, single visual element.\n5.  **Fix \"Fighting\" Text:** In `FeaturesSection.tsx`, add bottom padding to the main heading to prevent the descenders of letters like 'g' from being cut off.\n6.  **Update Feature Icons:** In `FeaturesSection.tsx`, change the image sources for the three feature icons from the placeholder `.svg` files to the provided `.png` files.\n7.  **Enhance Workflow Section:** Update `WorkflowSection.tsx` to improve the visual flow of the steps, making it look more like a connected process.\n8.  **Fix Particle Rendering:** By adding the missing `tsparticles` dependencies, the sparkles in the `MissionSection.tsx` (via `LampContainer.tsx`) should now render correctly as part of the background effect.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nPlease run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependencies required for the particle animations:\n```bash\nnpm install @tsparticles/react @tsparticles/engine @tsparticles/slim\n```\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n```\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C4 - Layout and visual fixes\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-100px] md:mt-[-50px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col pt-16 md:pt-20\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            Workflow.\n            <br/>\n            Become a Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

My course of action is to address the layout issues in the hero section, fix text and image rendering problems, improve the visual presentation of the workflow diagram, and enable the particle effects that are currently disabled due to missing dependencies.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Add Dependencies:** I will update `package.json` to include the necessary `tsparticles` libraries. This will require you to run `npm install` to resolve the missing modules.\n2.  **Fix Header Overlap:** I will adjust the `HeroSection` component by adding top padding to ensure its content is not obscured by the fixed header.\n3.  **Correct Hero Visuals:** In `HeroSection.tsx`, I will modify the layout to display a single, centered visual (`pcp.gif`) instead of the split side-by-side images, creating a more focused presentation.\n4.  **Reduce Blank Space:** I will adjust the vertical margins in `app/page.tsx` to reduce the large empty space below the hero section.\n5.  **Fix \"Fighting\" Text:** In `FeaturesSection.tsx`, I will add padding below the main headline to prevent the text from being cut off.\n6.  **Update Feature Icons:** I will update the `FeaturesSection.tsx` component to use the provided `.png` icon files instead of the previous `.svg` placeholders and remove the `invert` styling which is not suitable for PNGs.\n7.  **Enhance Workflow Visuals:** I will refactor the `WorkflowSection.tsx` to present the five steps in a more visually appealing and process-oriented layout.\n8.  **Enable Sparkle Effect:** Finally, I will uncomment the `SparklesCore` component within `lamp.tsx` to enable the background particle effect for the \"Mission\" section, which should now function correctly with the new dependencies installed.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\n1.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the feedback from the latest screenshots and the provided context. My plan is to address the layout issues, dependency problems, and asset updates to bring the homepage closer to the design vision. I will install the missing `tsparticles` libraries to fix the sparkle animations, adjust the page layout to prevent the header from overlapping content, and correct the hero section's visual display to feature the animated GIF prominently. Additionally, I will fix typography rendering issues, replace the placeholder feature icons with the newly provided PNG assets, and perform a minor style enhancement on the workflow section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `package.json`:** Add the missing `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/engine`, and `@tsparticles/slim` dependencies to resolve the runtime errors with the `SparklesCore` component.\n2.  **Update `src/app/layout.tsx`:** Add top padding to the `main` element to push the page content below the fixed header, resolving the text overlap issue.\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Remove the fixed `h-screen` to allow the `ContainerScroll` component to manage the section's height.\n    *   Reconfigure the content within `ContainerScroll` to remove the two-column grid and prominently feature the `pcp.gif` as a single, centered visual, which better demonstrates the DCE workflow.\n4.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** Adjust the top margin of the `FeaturesSection` wrapper to a negative value. This will pull the section up into the whitespace created by the tall `ContainerScroll` component, fixing the large gap.\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Add padding to the section title to prevent the bottom of letters from being cut off.\n    *   Update the `features` array to use the provided `.png` icon files instead of the `.svg` placeholders.\n    *   Remove the `invert` styling from the icon `Image` components as it is no longer needed for the PNG assets.\n6.  **Update `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** Apply minor styling enhancements to the workflow steps to give them a more defined, card-like appearance, improving the visual hierarchy as a precursor to future interactivity.\n7.  **Add `curator_activity` block:** Instruct the curator to run `npm install` to install the newly added dependencies.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nAfter accepting these changes, please run `npm install` or `yarn install` in your terminal to install the new dependencies required for the particle animations.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n```\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/layout.tsx\">\n```typescript\nimport type { Metadata } from \"next\";\nimport { Inter } from \"next/font/google\";\nimport \"./globals.css\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers/theme-provider\";\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/layout/Footer\";\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: [\"latin\"] });\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\ntitle: \"AIAscent.dev | Home of the Data Curation Environment\",\ndescription: \"The official website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the feedback from the latest screenshots and the provided ephemeral context. My course of action is to address the layout issues, update the assets as requested, and fix the missing dependency that is causing the sparkles effect to fail. I will begin by adding the required `tsparticles` libraries to `package.json` and will include a `curator_activity` block to ensure they are installed. Then, I will adjust the homepage layout to fix the header overlap and the large blank space in the hero section. I will also correct the \"split image\" issue to feature the animated GIF of the DCE workflow prominently. Finally, I will update the features section to use the provided PNG icons and fix the typography clipping issue.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `package.json`:** Add the missing `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/engine`, and `@tsparticles/slim` dependencies to resolve the compilation errors for the sparkles effect.\n2.  **Create `curator_activity`:** Add a block to instruct the curator to run `npm install` to install the new dependencies.\n3.  **Update `src/app/layout.tsx`:** Add padding to the main content area to prevent the fixed header from overlapping the page content on all pages.\n4.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Modify the `ContainerScroll` component's content to display only the `pcp.gif`, fixing the \"split image\" bug. I will also adjust the section's height to reduce the large blank space below it.\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Add padding to the section title to prevent the text from being cut off.\n    *   Update the `features` array to use the `.png` icon files as requested, replacing the `.svg` placeholders.\n    *   Remove the `invert` class from the `Image` components for the icons, as it is not suitable for PNGs.\n6.  **Update `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`:** Reduce the excessive height of the main container to help eliminate the large blank space on the homepage.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nI have added new dependencies to the `package.json` file.

My course of action is to address the layout and styling issues identified in the screenshots, install missing dependencies for the particle effects, and refine the component implementations to better match the user's vision.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Install Missing Dependencies:** I will update `package.json` to include the necessary `@tsparticles` libraries required for the `SparklesCore` component, which is used in the `LampComponent`.\n2.  **Fix Header Overlap:** I will modify `HeroSection.tsx` to add top padding, preventing the fixed header from obscuring the main headline.\n3.  **Correct Hero Visuals:** I will adjust `HeroSection.tsx` to remove the split-image grid within the `ContainerScroll` component. It will now prominently feature the `pcp.gif` to dynamically showcase the DCE workflow, as requested. I will also adjust component heights to reduce the large blank space below this section.\n4.  **Refine Features Section:** I will update `FeaturesSection.tsx` to add padding to the headline to prevent text from being cut off. I will also change the icon paths from `.svg` to the curator-provided `.png` files.\n5.  **Improve Workflow Visualization:** I will update the placeholder `WorkflowSection.tsx` with improved styling to better represent a process flow, making it more visually engaging.\n6.  **Fix Sparkles Effect:** I will review `LampComponent.tsx` and `MissionSection.tsx` to ensure the particle sparkle effect is correctly positioned behind the \"More Than Code\" headline, addressing the layering issue.\n7.  **Update Task Checklist:** I will update `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to reflect the completion of these tasks and outline the next steps for Cycle 5.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nAfter accepting these files, please run `npm install` (or your package manager's equivalent) to install the newly added dependencies for the particle effects.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C4 - Layout and visual corrections\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center relative !overflow-visible\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)] -z-10\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col pt-24 md:pt-32\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            Workflow.\n            <br />\n            Become a Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-lg md:text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C4 (Mark C4 tasks complete, create tasks for C5)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis artifact provides a structured format for tracking development tasks for the `aiascent.dev` website. It organizes work by the group of files involved and estimates complexity (token count and cycle count) to aid in planning for AI-assisted development.\n\n## 2. How to Use\n\n(See M3. Interaction Schema or T17. Template - Universal Task Checklist.md for detailed usage instructions.)\n\n-----\n\n## Task List for Cycle 5+\n\n## T-5: Interactive Workflow Visualization (Cycle 5+)\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`\n\n  - **Total Tokens:** ~1,000\n\n  - **More than one cycle?** No\n\n  - **Status:** To Do\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 5.1):** Enhance `WorkflowSection.tsx` to be more interactive as per user feedback. This could involve using Framer Motion to animate the steps or highlight them on scroll.\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1.  Scroll to the Workflow section on the home page.\n2.  **Expected:** The workflow steps should have some form of animation or interactivity that makes the section more engaging.\n\n## T-6: Interactive Showcase Implementation (Cycle 5+)\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`\n        - `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`\n        - `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`\n\n  - **Total Tokens:** ~10,000+\n\n  - **More than one cycle?** Yes\n\n  - **Status:** To Do\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 6.1):** Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` layout based on the design in A17 (Introduction, Component, Meta-Commentary).\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 6.2):** Enhance the core logic and styling for the `InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx` component (e.g., adding a Table of Contents sidebar).\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 6.3):** (Curator Task) Populate `whitepaperContent.json` with actual content (the placeholder is currently minimal).\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1.  Navigate to `/showcase`.\n2.  **Expected:** The page layout should match A17. The interactive component should function correctly with the available data.\n\n## T-7: Plan for Next Cycle\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 7.1):** Review progress, update this checklist, and prioritize tasks for the subsequent cycle.\n\n-----\n\n## Completed Tasks\n\n## T-4: Homepage Polish and Bug Fixes (Cycle 4)\n- **Status:** Completed (C4)\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.1):** Add missing `@tsparticles` dependencies to `package.json`.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.2):** Add top padding to `HeroSection.tsx` to prevent content from being obscured by the fixed header.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.3):** Correct the `HeroSection.tsx` to display a single `pcp.gif` in the `ContainerScroll` instead of a split view.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.4):** Adjust component heights in `HeroSection` and `ContainerScroll` to reduce the large empty space.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.5):** Add bottom padding to the headline in `FeaturesSection.tsx` to fix text cutoff.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.6):** Update `FeaturesSection.tsx` to use the new `.png` icons instead of `.svg` placeholders.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.7):** Improve the visual styling of the static `WorkflowSection.tsx`.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.8):** Correct the `z-index` and implementation in `LampComponent.tsx` to ensure the sparkles effect appears behind the text content.\n\n## T-3: Home Page Implementation (Cycle 3)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C3)\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.1):** Implement the `HeroSection.tsx` component based on A16.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.2):** Implement the `FeaturesSection.tsx` component based on A16.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.3):** Implement the `WorkflowSection.tsx` component.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.4):** Implement the `MissionSection.tsx` component based on A16.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.5):** Integrate these new components into `src/app/page.tsx`.\n\n## T-2: Strategic Planning and Asset Management (Cycle 2)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C2)\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 2.1):** Create A15 (Asset Wishlist) and generate placeholder assets.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 2.2):** Create page design artifacts (A16-A19).\n\n## T-1: Project Scaffolding (Cycle 1)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C1)\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 1.1):** Generate the initial Next.js project structure.\n</file_artifact><summary>\nI have analyzed the feedback from the current state of the website and will now implement the required changes. My course of action is to address the layout and styling issues identified in the screenshots, install missing dependencies for the particle effects, and refine the component implementations to better match the user's vision.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Install Missing Dependencies:** I will update `package.json` to include the necessary `@tsparticles` libraries required for the `SparklesCore` component, which is used in the `LampComponent`.\n2.  **Fix Header Overlap:** I will modify `HeroSection.tsx` to add top padding, preventing the fixed header from obscuring the main headline.\n3.  **Correct Hero Visuals:** I will adjust `HeroSection.tsx` to remove the split-image grid within the `ContainerScroll` component. It will now prominently feature the `pcp.gif` to dynamically showcase the DCE workflow, as requested. I will also adjust component heights to reduce the large blank space below this section.\n4.  **Refine Features Section:** I will update `FeaturesSection.tsx` to add padding to the headline to prevent text from being cut off. I will also change the icon paths from `.svg` to the curator-provided `.png` files.\n5.  **Improve Workflow Visualization:** I will update the placeholder `WorkflowSection.tsx` with improved styling to better represent a process flow, making it more visually engaging.\n6.  **Fix Sparkles Effect:** I will review `LampComponent.tsx` and `MissionSection.tsx` to ensure the particle sparkle effect is correctly positioned behind the \"More Than Code\" headline, addressing the layering issue.\n7.  **Update Task Checklist:** I will update `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to reflect the completion of these tasks and outline the next steps for Cycle 5.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nAfter accepting these files, please run `npm install` (or your package manager's equivalent) to install the newly added dependencies for the particle effects.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C4 - Layout and visual corrections\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center relative !overflow-visible\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)] -z-10\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col pt-24 md:pt-32\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            Workflow.\n            <br />\n            Become a Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-lg md:text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C4 (Mark C4 tasks complete, create tasks for C5)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis artifact provides a structured format for tracking development tasks for the `aiascent.dev` website. It organizes work by the group of files involved and estimates complexity (token count and cycle count) to aid in planning for AI-assisted development.\n\n## 2. How to Use\n\n(See M3. Interaction Schema or T17. Template - Universal Task Checklist.md for detailed usage instructions.)\n\n-----\n\n## Task List for Cycle 5+\n\n## T-5: Interactive Workflow Visualization (Cycle 5+)\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`\n\n  - **Total Tokens:** ~1,000\n\n  - **More than one cycle?** No\n\n  - **Status:** To Do\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 5.1):** Enhance `WorkflowSection.tsx` to be more interactive as per user feedback. This could involve using Framer Motion to animate the steps or highlight them on scroll.\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1.  Scroll to the Workflow section on the home page.\n2.  **Expected:** The workflow steps should have some form of animation or interactivity that makes the section more engaging.\n\n## T-6: Interactive Showcase Implementation (Cycle 5+)\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`\n        - `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`\n        - `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`\n\n  - **Total Tokens:** ~10,000+\n\n  - **More than one cycle?** Yes\n\n  - **Status:** To Do\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 6.1):** Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` layout based on the design in A17 (Introduction, Component, Meta-Commentary).\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 6.2):** Enhance the core logic and styling for the `InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx` component (e.g., adding a Table of Contents sidebar).\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 6.3):** (Curator Task) Populate `whitepaperContent.json` with actual content (the placeholder is currently minimal).\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1.  Navigate to `/showcase`.\n2.  **Expected:** The page layout should match A17. The interactive component should function correctly with the available data.\n\n## T-7: Plan for Next Cycle\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 7.1):** Review progress, update this checklist, and prioritize tasks for the subsequent cycle.\n\n-----\n\n## Completed Tasks\n\n## T-4: Homepage Polish and Bug Fixes (Cycle 4)\n- **Status:** Completed (C4)\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.1):** Add missing `@tsparticles` dependencies to `package.json`.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.2):** Add top padding to `HeroSection.tsx` to prevent content from being obscured by the fixed header.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.3):** Correct the `HeroSection.tsx` to display a single `pcp.gif` in the `ContainerScroll` instead of a split view.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.4):** Adjust component heights in `HeroSection` and `ContainerScroll` to reduce the large empty space.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.5):** Add bottom padding to the headline in `FeaturesSection.tsx` to fix text cutoff.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.6):** Update `FeaturesSection.tsx` to use the new `.png` icons instead of `.svg` placeholders.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.7):** Improve the visual styling of the static `WorkflowSection.tsx`.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.8):** Correct the `z-index` and implementation in `LampComponent.tsx` to ensure the sparkles effect appears behind the text content.\n\n## T-3: Home Page Implementation (Cycle 3)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C3)\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.1):** Implement the `HeroSection.tsx` component based on A16.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.2):** Implement the `FeaturesSection.tsx` component based on A16.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.3):** Implement the `WorkflowSection.tsx` component.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.4):** Implement the `MissionSection.tsx` component based on A16.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.5):** Integrate these new components into `src/app/page.tsx`.\n\n## T-2: Strategic Planning and Asset Management (Cycle 2)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C2)\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 2.1):** Create A15 (Asset Wishlist) and generate placeholder assets.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 2.2):** Create page design artifacts (A16-A19).\n\n## T-1: Project Scaffolding (Cycle 1)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C1)\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 1.1):** Generate the initial Next.js project structure.\n</file_artifact>"

          "content": "<summary>\nI've analyzed the user's feedback and will implement the requested visual adjustments to the homepage. My course of action is to address the spacing in the hero section, enlarge the feature images, expand the particle effect in the mission section, improve text readability over the particles, and remove a visual artifact causing a black line.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will increase the vertical spacing between the headline/button group and the `ContainerScroll` component to prevent the animated card from overlapping the buttons. I'll achieve this by adding more bottom margin to the text container.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** To make the feature images more prominent, I will significantly increase their size within their respective cards. I will adjust the `width` and `height` of the `Image` component and modify the parent `CardBody` container to accommodate the larger visuals, making them roughly half the card's height.\n\n3.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** To address the particle effect issues, I will first modify the `LampContainer`.\n    *   I will increase the `min-h` property to make the entire section taller, allowing the particle effect to cover a larger area as requested.\n    *   To fix the horizontal black line, I've identified that one of the `div` elements creating the lamp's light beam effect has a hard edge. I will adjust its `translate-y` property to move it down slightly, ensuring it blends seamlessly into the background and eliminating the artifact.\n\n4.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To improve the readability of the text over the particle effect, I will adjust the gradient of the main headline. I will change the gradient colors from `from-neutral-300 to-neutral-500` to a brighter `from-white to-neutral-400` to create better contrast against the cyan glow of the lamp effect.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Adjust layout and visuals for better spacing\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-150px] md:mt-[-100px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow. <br /> Become a Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-lg md:text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

My course of action is to address the spacing in the Hero section, enlarge the images in the Features section, and expand and clean up the particle effect in the Mission section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Adjust Hero Section Spacing:** I will modify `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` to add more vertical space above the `ContainerScroll` component. This will prevent the scrolling card from overlapping the main headline and call-to-action buttons, providing a cleaner presentation. I will replace the temporary `<br/>` tags with a more robust padding solution.\n\n2.  **Enlarge Feature Images:** I will update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx` to significantly increase the size of the three feature images. I will adjust the `Image` component dimensions and the surrounding `CardItem` container to make the icons much more prominent, as requested.\n\n3.  **Refine Mission Section Particles:**\n    *   **Expand Particles:** I will modify `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`. I'll increase the size of the container for the `SparklesCore` component, making the particle effect span a much larger portion of the section background.\n    *   **Improve Text Readability:** In `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`, I will adjust the text gradient to be brighter, making it more legible against the dynamic background of the `LampComponent`.\n    *   **Remove Horizontal Line:** I will investigate the `motion.div` elements within `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`. The horizontal black line is likely an artifact caused by a hard edge between masking elements. I will adjust the positioning and add a blur effect to the masking div to create a seamless blend and eliminate the line.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Adjust layout and visuals for better spacing\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col w-full\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col pt-24 md:pt-32\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow.

My course of action is to address the spacing in the Hero section, enlarge the images in the Features section, and refine the particle effect and text readability in the Mission section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `HeroSection.tsx`:** I will add additional vertical spacing above the main headline to push the entire hero content block down, ensuring the `ContainerScroll` animation does not overlap with the call-to-action buttons in its initial state.\n\n2.  **Update `FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will significantly increase the size of the three feature images to make them more prominent, as requested. This involves increasing the `width` and `height` props on the `Image` components and adjusting their container dimensions to ensure they are displayed correctly without distortion. I will also increase the overall size of the cards to accommodate the larger images.\n\n3.  **Update `MissionSection.tsx` & `lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   To expand the particle effect, I will modify `lamp.tsx` to increase the height of the `LampContainer` and the dimensions of the `SparklesCore` component's wrapper, allowing the particles to fill the entire section.\n    *   To improve text readability, I will tone down the intensity of the cyan light effect in `lamp.tsx` by changing the colors from `cyan` to a more subtle `neutral` shade. This will increase the contrast between the background and the text.\n    *   To remove the horizontal black line observed by the user, I will remove the specific `motion.div` element in `lamp.tsx` that is responsible for rendering this line.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Add vertical spacing to prevent button overlap\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-150px] md:mt-[-100px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow.

My course of action is to increase spacing in the hero section, enlarge the feature images, and expand and refine the particle effect in the mission section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Adjust Hero Section Spacing:** I will modify `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` to add more vertical space between the main text/buttons and the animated `ContainerScroll` component, preventing the buttons from being obscured. I will also remove the temporary `<br>` tags from the title for a cleaner, CSS-based solution.\n2.  **Enlarge Feature Images:** I will update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx` to make the three feature images more prominent. This involves increasing the size of the image containers and the `Image` components themselves, as well as widening the parent cards to accommodate the new dimensions.\n3.  **Refine Mission Section Particles:**\n    *   I will edit `src/components/global/lamp.tsx` to expand the area where the particles are rendered by increasing the minimum height of the `LampContainer`.\n    *   To address the hard-to-read text in `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`, I will increase the text's contrast by making it a lighter color.\n    *   To fix the horizontal black line in the particle area, I will remove a specific overlay `div` within `lamp.tsx` that appears to be creating an unnatural hard edge, allowing the particle effect to blend more smoothly with the background.\n    *   I will also soften the harsh cyan light color in `lamp.tsx` to a more neutral tone to further improve text readability and align with the site's sophisticated aesthetic.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Adjust layout and visuals for spacing\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-50px] md:mt-0\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8 pt-16\">\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow.

My course of action is to address the spacing in the Hero section, enlarge the images in the Features section, and refine the particle effect and text readability in the Mission section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will add additional vertical spacing above the main headline to push the title and CTA buttons further down the page. This will prevent the `ContainerScroll` animation from overlapping with the buttons when it is in its upper position.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will significantly increase the size of the three feature images. This involves adjusting the height of the container `div` and increasing the `width` and `height` props of the Next.js `Image` component to make them more prominent, as requested.\n\n3.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To improve readability, I will adjust the text color gradient to be brighter and have more contrast against the dark, animated background.\n\n4.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will make several adjustments here to address the particle effect issues:\n    *   I will increase the `min-h` property of the `LampContainer` to expand the overall height of the section, giving the particle effect more space to render.\n    *   I will investigate the horizontal black line artifact. My primary suspect is an absolutely positioned `div` used to mask the top of the lamp effect. I will adjust its `translate-y` property to move it slightly higher, ensuring it no longer creates a visible edge within the particle field.\n    *   To further improve text readability, I will tone down the intensity of the cyan light effect by changing `cyan-500` to `cyan-600` and `cyan-400` to `cyan-500`, making the background less bright.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Add vertical spacing to prevent button overlap\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-150px] md:mt-[-100px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow.

My course of action is to refine the styling of the Hero, Features, and Mission sections to improve spacing, prominence, and readability, as well as to fix a visual artifact in the particle effect.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Adjust Hero Section Spacing:** I will edit `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` to add more vertical space above the main headline. This will prevent the scroll animation card from partially obscuring the call-to-action buttons when it's in its initial, larger state.\n\n2.  **Enlarge Feature Cards:** In `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`, I will significantly increase the size of the three feature cards and the images within them to make them more prominent, as requested. I will adjust the width and height constraints to make them a central visual element.\n\n3.  **Improve Mission Section Text:** To enhance readability against the particle background in `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`, I will adjust the text's gradient, making it brighter and increasing the contrast.\n\n4.  **Expand and Fix Particle Effect:** I will modify `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`. First, I'll increase the minimum height of the `LampContainer` to make the particle effect encompass a larger portion of the section. Second, I will apply a blur effect to a specific div that is likely causing the noticeable horizontal black line, which should soften the edge and blend it into the background.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Add more vertical spacing to prevent button overlap\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-150px] md:mt-[-100px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow.

This involves adjusting the container widths and the image dimensions to fill the larger space.\n3.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** To fix the Mission section's particle effect, I will expand the overall height of the `LampContainer`. I will also enlarge the container for the `SparklesCore` component to fill the entire section, ensuring the particles are not confined to a small area. Additionally, I will remove the specific `motion.div` that is rendering the unwanted horizontal line.\n4.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To improve the readability of the text against the particle background, I will adjust the text's gradient to use brighter colors, making it stand out more clearly.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Add more vertical spacing\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-150px] md:mt-[-100px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow.

My course of action is to address the hero section spacing, increase the size of the feature images, and expand and refine the particle effect in the mission section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will add additional line breaks within the main `h1` title. This will increase the top padding of the entire hero text block, pushing the `ContainerScroll` animation further down the page to prevent it from overlapping the call-to-action buttons.\n2.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** To make the feature images more prominent as requested, I will significantly increase their container size from `h-24` to `h-72`. I will also update the `Image` component's props to a larger size (`300x300`) and ensure it uses `object-contain` to scale correctly within the new, larger area.\n3.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   To expand the particle effect to cover the entire section, I will change the `min-h-[600px]` on the `LampContainer` to `min-h-screen`, making it fill the viewport's height.\n    *   To remove the unwanted horizontal black line, I will delete the `motion.div` element that renders the thin \"filament\" of the lamp, as it appears to be the source of this visual artifact.\n    *   To improve the readability of the text over the particles, I will change the lamp's color from a bright `cyan-500` to a more subtle `neutral-500`, reducing the background glare.\n4.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** I will review the text styling to ensure it has sufficient contrast against the newly dimmed particle background in `lamp.tsx`. The existing gradient text should be more readable now.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C5 - Expand particle area, remove

My course of action is to address the sizing and spacing issues in the Hero, Features, and Mission sections to create a more polished and visually impactful presentation. I will expand the hero GIF to be more prominent, enlarge the feature images to showcase their detail, and refine the Mission section's sparkle effect to remove awkward spacing and visual artifacts.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will modify the layout to make the `pcp.gif` significantly larger, removing the restrictive container and allowing it to fill more of the available horizontal space. This will improve visibility of the details within the animation.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will redesign the layout to give the feature images much more prominence. By increasing the size of the cards and the images within them, the details of the artwork will become a central focus, making the section more visually appealing.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** I will adjust the styling to remove the large empty space below the \"More Than Code\" title, creating a more seamless transition to the footer.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will fine-tune the `LampContainer` component. This involves:\n    *   Removing the element causing a visual artifact behind the text.\n    *   Adjusting the vertical alignment to move the lamp's light beam to the top of the section, eliminating the awkward gap above the sparkles.\n    *   Expanding the sparkles effect to fill the entire background of the section.\n    *   Reducing the overall minimum height of the container to remove the large blank space before the footer.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C6 - Enlarge GIF display area\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-50px] md:mt-0\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8 pt-16\">\n            Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-lg md:text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the feedback and the annotated screenshots. My course of action is to address the layout and sizing issues in the Hero, Features, and Mission sections to create a more polished and visually impactful homepage. I will enlarge key visual elements, remove distracting backgrounds and spacing, and fix rendering artifacts.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will modify the `ContainerScroll` component to remove the restrictive `max-w-5xl` class on its inner card, allowing the `pcp.gif` to expand and fill more of the available horizontal space. I will also adjust the vertical margin to ensure there is adequate spacing between the hero text and the animated visual.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`:** I will remove the `bg-gray-100` class from the card's content area. This will eliminate the white box behind the `pcp.gif`, allowing it to blend seamlessly with the dark theme of the hero section.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** To make the feature images more prominent, I will significantly increase their size. I will adjust the layout by increasing the width of the cards and the height of the image containers, ensuring the feature visuals are large, detailed, and impactful.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will address all three issues in the Mission/Sparkles section:\n    *   To eliminate the empty space above the sparkles (Issue 1), I will wrap the `SparklesCore` component in an absolutely positioned div that fills the entire container.\n    *   To fix the strange rectangle artifact (Issue 2), I will remove the specific `div` that was creating an opaque background block behind the text.\n    *   To remove the large empty space below (Issue 3), I will reduce the `min-h` of the `LampContainer`, creating a much tighter and more cohesive layout leading into the footer.\n\n5.  **Update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:** To allow the sparkles from the Mission section to bleed into the footer for a more integrated look, I will make the footer's background transparent and remove the top border.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C6 - Enlarge hero visual and adjust spacing\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-50px] md:mt-0\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8 pt-16\">\n            Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-lg md:text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

The white background will be removed.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will redesign the feature cards to make the images the primary focus. I will increase the overall card size and allocate more space to the images, making them larger and more impactful as requested.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** I will remove the large empty space below this section to create a more compact layout leading into the footer.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** This component is used by the Mission section. I will adjust its internal structure to fix the visual artifacts noted in the screenshot. Specifically, I will move the lamp's light beam higher, expand the sparkles to fill the entire background area, and remove the element causing the strange rectangle artifact.

This will remove the white box around the hero GIF, allowing it to blend seamlessly with the dark background of the hero section.\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Adjust the `Image` component for the `pcp.gif`. I will change `objectFit=\"contain\"` to `objectFit=\"cover\"` to ensure the GIF fills its container more effectively and appears larger and more detailed as requested.\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** To make the feature images more prominent, I will increase the overall size of the cards and the images within them. The card width will be increased, and the `Image` component's dimensions will be enlarged to make the visuals a more central focus of the section.\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   To fix the spacing issues, I will reduce the `min-h-[800px]` on the `LampContainer` to remove the large empty space below the component.\n    *   I will increase the height of the `SparklesCore` container and adjust its vertical positioning to fill the empty space above the text, creating a fuller particle effect.\n    *   The horizontal \"lamp line\" will be moved further up by adjusting its `translate-y` property.\n    *   I will investigate the blurred `motion.div` elements to find and eliminate the rectangular visual artifact behind the text.\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** I will remove the `mt-8` from the main heading to allow it to sit higher within the `LampContainer`, closer to the light source, improving the visual composition.\n6.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** I will remove the negative margin that pulls the `FeaturesSection` up, as this is contributing to some of the awkward spacing between sections.

I will increase the size of the cards and the images within them, ensuring the details of the artwork are clearly visible and impactful.\n3.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`**: Refactor the `LampContainer` component to address several issues.

My course of action is to address the sizing and presentation of the images in the Hero and Features sections, and to fix several layout and aesthetic issues in the Mission/Sparkles section to create a more polished and immersive user experience.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will modify the styling of the `ContainerScroll` component to remove the white background that is clashing with the dark theme. I will also adjust the component's height and the `Image` properties to make the `pcp.gif` significantly larger, allowing its details to be clearly visible and better utilizing the available screen space.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will restructure this section to give the feature images more prominence. I will change the layout of each feature card to be more vertical, placing a much larger image above the title and description, which will better showcase the visual details as requested.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will perform several fixes here to address the issues in the \"More Than Code\" section:\n    *   I will expand the `SparklesCore` component to fill the entire container, eliminating the empty space at the top.\n    *   I will remove a masking `div` that was creating an unwanted black bar at the top of the section.\n    *   I will remove a `div` that was causing the rectangular visual artifact behind the text.\n    *   I will adjust the overall height of the container to remove the large empty space below the content.\n    *   I will move the horizontal \"lamp line\" element higher up to improve the visual composition.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To allow the sparkles to extend behind the footer, I will add a negative bottom margin to this section, effectively pulling the footer up over the bottom of the sparkles effect.\n\n5.  **Update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:** I will make the footer's background transparent. This will allow the sparkles from the `MissionSection` to be visible behind it, creating the seamless, layered effect the user described.\n\n6.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** I will add a `relative` positioning and `overflow-hidden` class to the main page container.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the feedback from Cycle 6 and will implement a series of visual and layout enhancements to address the requested changes. My course of action focuses on increasing the size and impact of key visual elements, refining the layout of the \"Sparkles\" section to improve visual flow, and fixing a visual artifact.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`:** Modify the `Card` component to remove the white background that is incorrectly framing the hero section's GIF. I will change the `bg-gray-100` class to `bg-black` to match the site's dark theme. I will also remove the padding to allow the GIF to fill more of its container.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** To make the primary GIF larger and more detailed as requested, I will adjust the constraints on the `ContainerScroll` component, increasing its maximum width and modifying its height to create a more panoramic and impactful presentation.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will completely refactor this section's layout. Instead of the current three-column grid of small cards, I will implement a single-column, alternating layout. Each feature will be presented in a dedicated, full-width block with a large image on one side and the descriptive text on the other. This will dramatically increase the size and prominence of the feature images, making their details more visible and appealing.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will make several adjustments to fix the layout issues in the \"More Than Code\" section.\n    *   To address the empty space above the sparkles, I will adjust the vertical positioning of the lamp's light beam elements, moving them higher.\n    *   To eliminate the rectangular visual artifact, I will soften the blur effect on one of the underlying `div` elements that creates the lamp's glow.\n    *   I will also adjust the z-index to ensure the sparkles render correctly behind the main content.\n\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To remove the large empty space below the sparkles and create a seamless transition to the footer, I will reduce the minimum height of the `LampContainer`. Additionally, I will add a negative bottom margin to the section, allowing the sparkles effect to overlap with the footer as suggested.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx\n// C6 - Remove white background from card\n'use client'\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react'\nimport { useScroll, useTransform, motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\n// Define the type for the children prop, which will contain the visuals (images/gifs)\ntype ContainerScrollProps = {\ntitleComponent: string | React.ReactNode;\nchildren: React.ReactNode; // Added children prop\n};\n\nexport const ContainerScroll = ({\ntitleComponent,\nchildren, // Destructure children\n}: ContainerScrollProps) => {\nconst containerRef = useRef<any>(null)\nconst { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({\ntarget: containerRef,\n})\nconst [isMobile, setIsMobile] = React.useState(false)\n\nReact.useEffect(() => {\nconst checkMobile = () => {\nsetIsMobile(window.innerWidth <= 768)\n}\ncheckMobile()\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\nreturn () => {\nwindow.removeEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\n}\n}, [])\n\nconst scaleDimensions = () => {\nreturn isMobile ?

refining the visual presentation of the homepage based on your detailed feedback.\n\nFirst, I addressed the hero section by removing the distracting white background around the main GIF and expanding its container. This makes the `pcp.gif` significantly larger and more immersive, allowing the details of the DCE workflow to be clearly visible against the dark theme.\n\nNext, I completely redesigned the features section. I replaced the three small, side-by-side cards with a more dynamic, single-column layout. Each feature—\"Precision Context Curation,\" \"Parallel Co-Pilot,\" and \"Iterative Knowledge Graph\"—is now showcased in its own large-format, alternating block with a prominent image and descriptive text. This change gives the feature visuals the space and emphasis they need to be impactful.\n\nFinally, I made several adjustments to the \"More Than Code\" section at the bottom of the page. I resolved the layout issues by removing the empty space above and below the sparkles effect and repositioning the central \"lamp\" light for a better aesthetic. The strange rectangular visual artifact has been eliminated by softening the underlying blur effect. To create a more seamless and integrated feel, I also adjusted the layout so that the sparkles now extend down and overlap with the site's footer, as you suggested.\n\nThese changes collectively enhance the visual hierarchy, improve the aesthetic consistency of the homepage, and make the key visual elements more engaging for visitors."

My course of action is to address the sizing and background of the hero section's GIF, redesign the features section for greater visual impact, and fix the layout and graphical artifacts in the mission/sparkles section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will modify the layout to allow the main `pcp.gif` to be significantly larger. The container will be expanded, and padding will be adjusted to give the visual more prominence and ensure details are readable.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`:** I will remove the white `bg-gray-100` from the inner card of the `ContainerScroll` component, making it transparent to blend seamlessly with the dark theme of the hero section. I will also increase the `max-width` of the card to accommodate the larger GIF.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** This section will be completely redesigned. I will replace the three-column card layout with a more dynamic, alternating layout.

My focus will be on enlarging the key visual elements, fixing layout spacing issues in the \"sparkles\" section, and removing visual artifacts.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will significantly enlarge the `pcp.gif` to improve visibility and impact. This involves removing the restrictive white background from the `Card` component within the `ContainerScroll` animation and adjusting the container's properties to allow the GIF to occupy more horizontal space, addressing the user's feedback about the small, unreadable visual.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** To make the feature visuals more prominent, I will refactor the layout. Instead of three small horizontal cards, I will arrange them in a way that allows each image to be much larger and more detailed, as requested. I will increase the size of the images within their cards to make them a central focus.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** I will eliminate the large empty space below the \"More Than Code\" title by removing the `min-h-[800px]` property from the `LampContainer`, allowing the section to fit its content more snugly against the footer.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will address the three specific issues in this component:\n    *   I will move the horizontal \"lamp line\" element higher to the top of the container.\n    *   I will remove the strange rectangular visual artifact by adjusting the background properties of one of the blur/backdrop layers.\n    *   I will expand the `SparklesCore` component to fill the entire container, ensuring sparkles reach the top and bottom edges to create a more seamless and immersive effect, removing the empty space above.\n\n5.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** I will adjust the margin between the `HeroSection` and `FeaturesSection` to account for the layout changes and ensure a visually pleasing flow between sections.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/page.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/app/page.tsx\n// C6 -

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the user's feedback from the screenshots and will implement the requested visual improvements. My course of action is to make the `pcp.gif` and feature images larger and more prominent, and to fix the layout and visual artifacts in the \"More Than Code\" section with the sparkles effect.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Modify the `ContainerScroll`'s child `div` to remove the light background, allowing the dark theme to show through. I will also adjust the styling to make the `pcp.gif` significantly larger, filling more of the available screen space as requested, to make its details more visible.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will refactor this section's layout to give the feature images much more prominence. Instead of three small cards side-by-side, I will change the layout to a more focused presentation where each feature's image is displayed in a larger format, making the details clear and impactful. I will stack them vertically with more emphasis on the visual component.\n\n3.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To address the spacing issues, I will remove the `min-h-[800px]` from the `LampContainer` and adjust the padding.

My course of action is to address the four specific problems identified in the marked-up screenshot: the cut-off title, the rectangular visual artifacts, the excessive empty space above the footer, and the incorrect positioning of the footer text. I will modify the styling in the `MissionSection`, `LampContainer`, and `Footer` components to resolve these layout and aesthetic issues.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Fix Footer Layout (`Footer.tsx`):** I will modify the flexbox properties of the main container in `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`. By changing `justify-between` and adjusting padding, I will push the \"Built using...\" text to the bottom-left and the copyright text to the bottom-right, aligning them with the corners as requested.\n\n2.  **Adjust Mission Section Content Position (`MissionSection.tsx`):** To fix the cut-off title (\"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM\"), I will adjust the vertical positioning of the content within the `LampContainer`. The negative translation (`-translate-y-80`) applied to the main content `div` is too aggressive. I will reduce this value to pull the text down, ensuring the title is fully visible below the lamp's light beam.\n\n3.  **Refine Lamp Component and Reduce Space (`lamp.tsx`):**\n    *   **Remove Artifacts:** The rectangular artifacts are caused by a specific `div` with a `blur-2xl` class that creates a hard-edged background effect. I will remove this element to allow the particle background to show through cleanly.\n    *   **Reduce Empty Space:** The excessive vertical space is caused by a large `min-h` and bottom padding (`pb-40`) on the `LampContainer`.

The problems include a cut-off title, visual artifacts in the background effect, excessive empty space, and misaligned footer text.\n\nMy course of action is to address these layout and styling issues by modifying the `MissionSection`, the `lamp` component it uses, and the `Footer` component to create a more polished and visually cohesive final section for the page.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   To fix the cut-off title, I will adjust the vertical translation (`translate-y`) of the main content area, moving it down to be fully visible below the lamp's light source.\n    *   To eliminate the rectangular visual artifacts, I will remove a specific `div` that was creating a hard-edged blur effect, allowing the background to be composed purely of the smoother gradients and the sparkle effect.\n    *   To make the sparkle effect more expansive and eliminate the \"weird rectangle effects\" pointed out, I will ensure the `SparklesCore` component fills the entire background of the `LampContainer`.\n    *   I will also reduce the bottom padding of the `LampContainer` to help eliminate the extra vertical space.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   I will remove the negative margin that was previously used to pull the footer up. The spacing issue will now be resolved by the reduced padding in the `LampContainer` itself, creating a cleaner layout.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:**\n    *   To fix the positioning, I will refactor the footer's internal structure. I will replace the centered `container` div with a full-width flexbox container.\n    *   I will set this container to `justify-between` to push the two text elements to the far left and right edges.\n    *   Finally, I will add horizontal padding directly to the `div` to give the text some space from the absolute corners of the viewport, achieving the desired corner-aligned appearance.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 - Adjust layout to fix title cutoff and remove visual artifacts\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C7: Reduced bottom padding significantly to remove empty space\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20 pb-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      {/* C7: Ensure sparkles fill the entire container background */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-125 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-56 overflow-visible w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-56 w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        {/* C7: This div creates a soft backdrop blur without hard edges */}\n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-10 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        \n        {/* C7: This div creates the soft glow effect */}\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        \n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[18rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-60 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}```\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C7 - Remove negative margin\n'use client';

This involves adjusting the flexbox properties and container structure for better control.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 - Adjust layout to fix title cutoff, artifacts, and spacing\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C7: Reduced bottom padding from pb-40 to pb-20 to decrease space\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20 pb-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      {/* Sparkles now fill the entire container */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-125 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-56 overflow-visible w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-56 w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        {/* C7: Removed the div causing the rectangular blur artifact */}\n        {/* <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div> */}\n\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[18rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n\n        {/* C7: Removed the div that created the top black bar/artifact */}\n        {/* <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-40 h-44 w-full -translate-y-[12.5rem] bg-neutral-950 \"></div> */}\n      </div>\n\n      {/* C7: Reduced upward translation from -translate-y-80 to -translate-y-64 to move content down */}\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-64 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C7 - Remove negative margin\n'use client';

My course of action is to address the cut-off title, visual artifacts, excessive spacing, and incorrect footer positioning.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Fix Cut-Off Title & Reduce Space:** I will modify `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`. I'll add significant top padding to the content to push the title down, preventing it from being clipped by the lamp effect's container. Simultaneously, I will increase the negative bottom margin substantially to pull the footer up and eliminate the large empty space between the sections.\n2.  **Fix Visual Artifacts:** I will update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`. The rectangular artifacts are likely caused by the container being too small for the visual effects to blend properly. I will increase the overall vertical padding of the `LampContainer` to give the sparkles and light effects more room to render, which should soften the hard edges causing the artifacts. I will also adjust the lamp's \"line\" to be positioned correctly within this new, larger space.\n3.  **Reposition Footer Text:** I will refactor `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`. The current implementation centers the content block. I will modify the structure to make the footer span the full width of the viewport, with an inner container that uses `justify-between` to push the \"Built using...\" text to the left and the \"© 2025...\" text to the right, achieving the desired corner-aligned appearance on larger screens.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">```typescript\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C7 - Adjust padding and margin to fix layout issues\n'use client'; // LampContainer requires client-side rendering\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { LampContainer } from '@/components/global/lamp';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion';\n\nconst MissionSection = () => {\nreturn (\n// C7: Increased negative bottom margin significantly to reduce space above footer\n<section className=\"w-full -mb-80\">\n<LampContainer>\n<motion.div\ninitial={{ opacity: 0.5, y: 100 }}\nwhileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}\ntransition={{\ndelay: 0.3,\nduration: 0.8,\nease: 'easeInOut',\n}}\n// C7: Added significant top padding to push content down and prevent title cutoff\nclassName=\"flex flex-col items-center text-center pt-24\"\n>\n<h2 className=\"mt-8 bg-gradient-to-br from-neutral-300 to-neutral-500 py-4 bg-clip-text text-center text-4xl font-medium tracking-tight text-transparent md:text-6xl uppercase\">\nThe Rise of Cognitive Capitalism.\n</h2>\n<p className=\"text-xl text-neutral-200 max-w-3xl text-center my-8\">\nMastering AI collaboration is essential for competitiveness and individual empowerment.

I will change the main container to use Flexbox with `justify-between`, pushing the \"Built using...\" text to the left and the copyright notice to the right.\n    *   I will also adjust the padding and remove unnecessary container `divs` to ensure the text sits cleanly in the bottom corners of the viewport.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 - Adjust content position, blur effects, and padding to fix visual bugs\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C7: Reduced bottom padding from pb-40 to pb-20 to decrease space above footer\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20 pb-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      {/* C6: Sparkles now fill the entire container */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-125 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-56 overflow-visible w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-56 w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        {/* C7: Increased size and blur to remove rectangular artifacts */}\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-48 w-[32rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          // C6: Moved lamp line much higher\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[18rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n\n      </div>\n\n      {/* C7: Changed from -translate-y-80 to -translate-y-72 to prevent title cutoff */}\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-72 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C7 - Remove negative margin\n'use client';

My course of action is to fix the cut-off title, remove visual artifacts, reduce empty space, and correctly position the footer content.\n\n1.  **Fix Mission Section Layout (`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`):**\n    *   To fix the cut-off title and reduce the large empty space, I will significantly decrease the vertical padding and minimum height of the `LampContainer`.\n    *   I will also adjust the vertical translation (`-translate-y-`) of the lamp's light source and motion elements, moving them higher to create more room for the title.\n    *   To eliminate the rectangular visual artifacts, I will remove the `div` elements that use large blur effects (`blur-2xl`, `blur-3xl`), as these are creating the unwanted shapes.\n    *   I will also expand the width of the conic gradient motion divs to ensure the light effect feels expansive and covers the area properly.\n\n2.  **Clean up `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   I will remove the negative margin (`-mb-40`) that was previously added. The layout adjustments in `lamp.tsx` provide a cleaner solution for managing the space between this section and the footer.\n\n3.  **Reposition Footer Content (`src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`):**\n    *   To align the footer text to the corners, I will restructure the component. Instead of a single centered container, I will use a full-width flex container with `justify-between`.\n    *   This will allow the two text blocks to be pushed to the left and right edges of the viewport, with appropriate padding to keep them from touching the absolute corners.\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   Reduce `min-h` and `pb` (padding-bottom) to decrease the overall height of the section.\n    *   Increase the negative `translate-y` values for the lamp's core elements to move the light source up and prevent it from obscuring the title.\n    *   Remove the `div`s with `blur-2xl` and `blur-3xl` classes that are causing the rectangular artifacts.\n    *   Widen the conic gradient `motion.div` elements to create a smoother, more expansive lighting effect.\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Remove the `className=\"-mb-40\"` from the `section` element to let the updated `LampContainer` manage the spacing naturally.\n3.  **Update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:**\n    *   Replace the main `div`'s `container` class with classes for a full-width flexbox layout (`w-full`, `flex`, `justify-between`, `items-center`, `px-8`).\n    *   Remove the now-unnecessary inner wrapper `div`.\n    *   Adjust the text alignment and padding on the child `p` tags to ensure they align correctly to the left and right.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 -

My course of action is to address the cut-off title, remove the rectangular visual artifacts, reduce the excessive empty space, and correctly position the footer elements. These changes primarily involve adjusting styles in the `MissionSection`, `LampContainer`, and `Footer` components.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Fix Cut-off Title and Rectangular Artifacts in `lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   The `LampContainer` is the source of the main visual problems. The cut-off title is due to the content being pushed too high (`-translate-y-80`). The rectangular artifacts are caused by background divs that don't cover the full container width.\n    *   I will modify `src/components/global/lamp.tsx` to expand its container to at least the full screen height (`min-h-screen`) to give content ample space.\n    *   I will adjust the vertical translation of the main content (`children`) to a smaller value, bringing the title fully into view.\n    *   I will remove the `scale-y-125` from an inner `div` that is distorting the background and contributing to the artifacts.\n    *   I will ensure the `SparklesCore` component is rendered with a higher `z-index` so it appears in front of the lamp's cone effects but behind the text content.\n\n2.  **Reduce Empty Space in `MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   The large gap between the mission content and the footer is caused by excessive vertical space in the `LampContainer`.\n    *   By adjusting the `LampContainer`'s layout and reducing the negative margin on the `MissionSection`, the large empty space will be eliminated, creating a more compact and visually appealing layout. I will remove the `-mb-40` class from the section.\n\n3.  **Reposition Footer Elements in `Footer.tsx`:**\n    *   The footer text is currently centered because it's inside a `container` div with `mx-auto`.\n    *   To position the text elements in the corners, I will refactor `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`. I will replace the single container `div` with a full-width `div` that uses Flexbox (`flex justify-between items-center`). This will push the \"Built using...\" text to the left and the copyright notice to the right, with padding to keep them from touching the absolute edges of the screen.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```typescript\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 - Adjust layout to fix cut-off title and visual artifacts\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C7: Changed to min-h-screen and adjusted padding\n        'relative flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 items-center justify-center isolate z-0 \">\n        {/* C7: Sparkles moved here with a z-index to be behind text but in front of cones */}\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-10\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-56 overflow-visible w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-56 w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 h-48 w-full translate-y-12 scale-x-150 bg-neutral-950 blur-2xl\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[7rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-40 h-44 w-full -translate-y-[12.5rem] bg-neutral-950 \"></div>\n      </div>\n\n      {/* C7: Reduced negative translation to bring content down */}\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-1/2 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n```typescript\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C7 - Remove negative margin\n'use client';

My course of action is to address the cut-off title, visual artifacts, excessive spacing, and incorrect footer alignment by making targeted adjustments to the Mission section, the Lamp component, and the Footer.\n\n1.  **Fix Cut-off Title and Spacing in Lamp Component:** I will edit `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`.\n    *   To prevent the title \"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM\" from being cut off, I will reduce the negative vertical translation on the main content container, moving it down into full view.\n    *   To eliminate the large empty space above the footer, I will significantly decrease the bottom padding of the `LampContainer`.\n\n2.  **Address Visual Artifacts:** In `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`, I will expand the vertical scale of the main light effect container. This will stretch the conical light gradient, aiming to cover the rectangular artifacts pointed out in the screenshot, creating a smoother visual.\n\n3.  **Adjust Mission Section Layout:** In `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`, I will adjust the negative bottom margin to compensate for the reduced padding in the `LampContainer`, ensuring the footer is positioned correctly without excessive overlap or spacing.\n\n4.  **Correct Footer Alignment:** I will refactor `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`.

My course of action is to address the layout and styling issues at the bottom of the homepage, focusing on the mission section and the footer. I will fix the cut-off title, remove the visual artifacts in the lamp effect, reduce the empty space above the footer, and correctly align the footer text to the corners.\n\n1.  **Fix Cut-off Title and Visual Artifacts:** I will modify `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`.\n    *   To fix the rectangular artifacts and give the lamp's light effect more room to blend smoothly, I will increase the minimum height of the `LampContainer` to fill the screen's height (`min-h-screen`).\n    *   To prevent the title from being cut off at the top, I will adjust the vertical positioning of the content within the `LampContainer`, bringing it down slightly.\n\n2.  **Reduce Empty Space Above Footer:** The large gap between the \"Read Our Mission\" button and the footer is caused by excessive bottom padding within the `LampContainer`. I will remove this large padding from `src/components/global/lamp.tsx` to shrink the empty space.\n\n3.  **Correct Footer Alignment:** I will update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` to achieve the desired corner-aligned layout. I will refactor the flexbox container to ensure it justifies its content to the space between, pushing the \"source code\" text to the left and the copyright text to the right on all screen sizes.\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   Increase the `LampContainer`'s minimum height to `min-h-screen` to expand the particle and lamp effect area, which will resolve the hard-edged rectangular artifacts.\n    *   Remove the large bottom padding (`pb-40`) to reduce the empty space below the content.\n    *   Adjust the vertical translation of the content wrapper from `-translate-y-80` to a smaller value like `-translate-y-72` to lower the content and prevent the title from being cut off.\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Remove the aggressive negative bottom margin (`-mb-40`) which is no longer necessary after adjusting the `LampContainer`'s height and padding.\n3.  **Update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:**\n    *   Simplify the flexbox layout within the footer's main container to `flex flex-row items-center justify-between`.\n    *   Remove the unnecessary wrapping `div` and responsive classes (`flex-col`, `md:flex-row`).\n    *   Ensure the two text elements are direct children of the container and have `text-left` and `text-center` (or `md:text-right`) alignment respectively, forcing them to opposite sides.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 -

I will adjust the vertical positioning of the content within the `LampContainer` component to ensure the title is fully visible. I will also remove a `scale-y-125` property that is likely distorting the lamp's light effect and causing the rectangular visual artifacts.\n2.  **Reduce Empty Space in `lamp.tsx` and `MissionSection.tsx`:** There is a large, unnecessary gap between the Mission section content and the footer. This is caused by excessive bottom padding in the `LampContainer` and a temporary negative margin on the `MissionSection`. I will reduce the padding within `lamp.tsx` and remove the negative margin from `MissionSection.tsx` for a cleaner layout that correctly closes the gap.\n3.  **Reposition Footer Content in `Footer.tsx`:** The footer text is currently centered due to being inside a `container` class. I will modify the footer's structure to span the full width of the viewport and use flexbox properties (`justify-between`) to push the two text elements to the far left and right corners, respectively, while maintaining appropriate padding.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 - Adjust vertical positioning to fix cut-off title and reduce empty space.

My course of action is to correct the cut-off title, remove the visual artifacts in the lamp effect, reduce the excessive empty space, and properly align the footer content to the corners. I will achieve this by modifying the positioning and sizing of elements within the `lamp` and `MissionSection` components, and by adjusting the flexbox layout of the `Footer`.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   To fix the rectangular visual artifacts, I will significantly increase the size (width and height) of the `motion.div` elements that create the conic gradient light effect. This will ensure their hard edges are rendered far outside the visible container area.\n    *   To fix the cut-off title, I will reduce the negative vertical translation on the content container, moving the children (including the title) down to give it more space at the top.\n    *   To reduce the large empty space above the footer, I will decrease the bottom padding of the main `LampContainer` div.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   I will remove the negative bottom margin that was pulling the footer up, as this was causing layout complications. Spacing will be managed within the `lamp` component and the page layout.\n    *   I will adjust the top margin of the main heading to ensure it has adequate spacing from the top of the lamp effect after the adjustments in `lamp.tsx`.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:**\n    *   To position the text elements in the bottom-left and bottom-right corners, I will refactor the main container within the footer. I will simplify the structure and use a flexbox layout with `justify-between` to push the two text elements to opposite ends of the container.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 - Fix artifacts, title cutoff, and spacing\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C7: Reduced bottom padding to fix spacing issue\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20 pb-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-125 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '60rem' }} // C7: Increased width\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          // C7: Increased height to fix artifacts\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-96 overflow-visible w-[60rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '60rem' }} // C7: Increased width\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          // C7: Increased height to fix artifacts\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-96 w-[60rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[18rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n\n      </div>\n\n      {/* C7: Reduced negative translation to move content down and prevent title cutoff */}\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-60 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}```\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C7 - Adjust layout to fix spacing and title cutoff\n'use client';
