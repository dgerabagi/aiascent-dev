I understand the plan to create a new website for DCE at `aiascent.dev`, repurposing existing assets to build a homepage and an interactive whitepaper. My course of action is to answer your technical hosting questions, provide the initial planning and documentation artifacts to \"pre-boot\" this new website project, and give you a clear list of which existing DCE artifacts you should copy over for context.\n\nI will begin by creating a new artifact that provides a comprehensive plan for hosting both `aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev` on your single server using Caddy, which is the best-practice solution for your setup. Then, I will generate the initial set of planning documents for the new website project itself, including a project vision, technical plan, and a specific plan for the interactive whitepaper. Finally, I will provide a clear, actionable list of the existing DCE artifacts you should port over.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Answer Hosting Questions:** I will create a new artifact, **`A113. aiascent.dev - Multi-Domain Hosting Plan.md`**, to provide a definitive answer to your questions. It will explain that you can point both domains' DNS records to your single IP and use a reverse proxy like Caddy to route traffic based on the domain name requested. I will provide a sample `Caddyfile` configuration.\n2.  **Pre-boot `aiascent-dev` Project:** I will generate the initial set of documentation artifacts required to start the new website project using the DCE workflow.\n    *   Create **`A114. aiascent.dev - Project Vision and Goals.md`** to define the scope and purpose of the new website.\n    *   Create **`A115. aiascent.dev - Technical Scaffolding Plan.md`** to propose a technical stack (Next.js, React, TypeScript) suitable for building the homepage and interactive report viewer.\n    *   Create **`A116. aiascent.dev - Interactive Whitepaper Plan.md`** to detail the requirements and implementation strategy for adapting the report viewer from `aiascent.game`.\n    *   Create **`A117. aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List.md`** to serve as the `A0` file for this new project, cataloging all the newly created planning documents.\n3.  **Provide Porting Instructions:** I will include a `<curator_activity>` section with a checklist of the essential documentation artifacts from the *current* DCE extension project that you should copy into your new `C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev\\context\\dce` directory to provide context for that new development effort.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A113. aiascent.dev - Multi-Domain Hosting Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A113: aiascent.dev - Multi-Domain Hosting Plan\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A technical guide explaining how to host multiple domains (aiascent.game and aiascent.dev) on a single server with one public IP address using a Caddy reverse proxy.\n- **Tags:** hosting, networking, dns, caddy, reverse proxy, multi-domain\n\n## 1. Overview & Goal\n\nThis document provides the technical solution for hosting both `aiascent.game` and the new `aiascent.dev` website on the same home server that is also running the vLLM instance. The goal is to configure the network and server to correctly route incoming traffic to the appropriate application based on the requested domain name.\n\nThe recommended and most robust solution is to use a reverse proxy, and since you are already using Caddy, we will expand that configuration.\n\n## 2. The Architecture\n\nThe setup involves three main parts: DNS, Port Forwarding, and the Caddy Reverse Proxy.\n\n```\n+----------------+      +----------------+      +-----------------+      +---------------------+\n|   DNS Records  |      |   AT&T Router  |      |  Caddy Server   |----->| aiascent.game (App) |\n| aiascent.game  |----->|                |      | (Reverse Proxy) |      | (localhost:3001)    |\n| aiascent.dev   |      | (Public IP)    |----->|                 |      +---------------------+\n+----------------+      |                |      |                 |\n                        | (Ports 80/443) |      |                 |      +---------------------+\n                        +----------------+      +-----------------+----->| aiascent.dev (App)  |\n                                                                         | (localhost:3002)    |\n                                                                         +---------------------+\n```\n\n## 3. Step-by-Step Configuration\n\n### Step 1: DNS Configuration\nYou are correct in your thinking. You need to configure the DNS \"A\" records for both of your domains to point to the same public IP address provided by your AT&T router.\n\n-   **`aiascent.game` -> A Record -> `[Your Public IP]`**\n-   **`aiascent.dev` -> A Record -> `[Your Public IP]`**\n\n### Step 2: Port Forwarding (AT&T Router)\nYour router is already configured to forward traffic for `aiascent.game`, but you should ensure it forwards all standard web traffic to your server's *local* IP address.\n\n-   Forward incoming TCP traffic on port **80** to your server's local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).\n-   Forward incoming TCP traffic on port **443** to your server's local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).\n\nCaddy will handle receiving traffic on these ports.\n\n### Step 3: Caddy Reverse Proxy Configuration (Caddyfile)\nThis is the core of the solution. Caddy will inspect the `Host` header of each incoming request and route it to the correct backend application running on a different internal port. This allows you to run multiple web services on the same machine.\n\nBelow is a sample `Caddyfile` that handles both domains. You will run your `aiascent.game` server on port `3001` and your new `aiascent.dev` website server on a different port, like `3002`.\n\n```caddy\n# Caddyfile for Multi-Domain Hosting\n\n{\n    # Global options, like your email for Let's Encrypt SSL certificates\n    email your-email@example.com\n}\n\n# Site 1: AI Ascent Game\naiascent.game, www.aiascent.game {\n    # Caddy automatically handles HTTPS for this domain.\n    \n    # Reverse proxy all requests for aiascent.game to your game server\n    # running on localhost port 3001.\n    reverse_proxy localhost:3001\n}\n\n# Site 2: New DCE Website\naiascent.dev, www.aiascent.dev {\n    # Caddy automatically handles HTTPS for this domain as well.\n    \n    # Reverse proxy all requests for aiascent.dev to your new website server\n    # running on localhost port 3002.\n    reverse_proxy localhost:3002\n}\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n1.  A user requests `https://aiascent.dev`.\n2.  DNS resolves it to your public IP.\n3.  Your router forwards the request on port 443 to your server.\n4.  Caddy receives the request. It sees the request is for `aiascent.dev`.\n5.  It looks at the `aiascent.dev` block in the `Caddyfile` and proxies the request to the application running on `localhost:3002`.\n\nThis setup is clean, secure (with automatic HTTPS), and easily scalable if you decide to add more domains in the future.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A114. aiascent.dev - Project Vision and Goals.md\">\n# Artifact A114: aiascent.dev - Project Vision and Goals\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** High-level overview of the aiascent.dev website, its purpose as a promotional hub for DCE, and its development plan.\n- **Tags:** project vision, goals, scope, aiascent.dev, dce, website\n\n## 1. Project Vision\n\nThe vision for the `aiascent.dev` website is to create a professional, public-facing hub for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) project. It will serve as the primary destination for developers to learn about the DCE, understand its value proposition, and access resources like tutorials and the project's whitepaper.\n\nCrucially, the website itself will be a **living demonstration of the DCE's power**. It will be built from the ground up using the DCE workflow, serving as a tangible showcase of what can be achieved with this new paradigm of AI-assisted development.\n\n## 2. High-Level Goals & Phases\n\nThe project will be developed in distinct phases.\n\n### Phase 1: Homepage & Core Content\n\nThe goal of this phase is to establish the foundational website with a compelling homepage that introduces the DCE.\n\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Develop a modern, responsive single-page homepage by adapting the shell of the `automationsaas` project.\n    -   Clearly articulate the problem DCE solves (the friction in AI context management) and its solution.\n    -   Include sections for \"Features,\" \"Workflow,\" and a \"Get Started\" call-to-action that links to the future VS Code Marketplace page.\n-   **Outcome:** A functional, visually appealing landing page that effectively promotes the DCE extension.\n\n### Phase 2: The Interactive Whitepaper\n\nThis phase focuses on building a unique and engaging way to present the project's whitepaper, further demonstrating the capabilities of DCE.\n\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Create a new section/tab on the website for an \"Interactive Whitepaper.\"\n    -   This feature will be a professionalized clone of the \"Report Viewer\" from the `aiascent.game` project.\n    -   It will present the content of the DCE whitepaper (`A78`) in an engaging, multi-modal format with text, images, and potentially narration.\n-   **Outcome:** A powerful showcase piece that not only communicates the project's strategic vision but also serves as a second example of a complex web tool built using the DCE.\n\n### Phase 3: Community & Resources\n\nThis phase will expand the site to include resources for a growing user community.\n\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Add a \"Tutorials\" section, using the report viewer infrastructure to host interactive guides on \"vibe coding\" and using the DCE effectively.\n    -   Add a \"Blog\" or \"Updates\" section to communicate project progress.\n-   **Outcome:** The `aiascent.dev` site becomes the central community and learning hub for the DCE project.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A115. aiascent.dev - Technical Scaffolding Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A115: aiascent.dev - Technical Scaffolding Plan\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** Outlines the proposed technical scaffolding and file structure for the aiascent.dev website, leveraging a modern React-based framework.\n- **Tags:** technical plan, scaffolding, file structure, typescript, nextjs, react\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis document outlines the proposed technical scaffolding and file structure for the `aiascent.dev` website. The plan is to use a modern, performant, and developer-friendly technology stack that aligns well with the existing assets (`automationsaas` shell, `aiascent.game` report viewer) which are built with React.\n\n## 2. Technology Stack\n\n-   **Language:** TypeScript\n-   **Framework:** Next.js (or a similar React framework like Vite + React)\n    -   **Rationale:** Next.js provides an excellent developer experience, server-side rendering (SSR) for fast initial page loads and good SEO, static site generation (SSG) for performance, and a robust routing system. This is a perfect fit for a content-focused promotional site and a complex interactive application like the report viewer.\n-   **Styling:** SCSS or TailwindCSS (To be determined by the `automationsaas` project's existing styles).\n-   **Deployment:** The application will be built as a static or Node.js-based site, to be served locally via the Caddy reverse proxy as detailed in `A113`.\n\n## 3. Proposed File Structure (Next.js App Router)\n\nThe project will adhere to the modern Next.js App Router structure, which is feature-driven and colocates components with the pages that use them.\n\n```\naiascent-dev/\n├── src/\n│   ├── app/\n│   │   ├── (main)/\n│   │   │   ├── page.tsx            # The main homepage component\n│   │   │   └── layout.tsx          # Root layout with header/footer\n│   │   │\n│   │   ├── whitepaper/\n│   │   │   ├── page.tsx            # The interactive whitepaper/report viewer page\n│   │   │   └── layout.tsx          # Layout specific to the whitepaper section\n│   │   │\n│   │   ├── globals.css             # Global styles\n│   │   └── layout.tsx              # Root layout\n│   │\n│   ├── components/                 # Shared, reusable UI components\n│   │   ├── Header.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   └── ReportViewer/           # The adapted report viewer component\n│   │       ├── ReportViewer.tsx\n│   │       └── ... (other sub-components)\n│   │\n│   ├── lib/                        # Utility functions, constants\n│   │\n│   └── context/                    # Folder for DCE context artifacts\n│       ├── aiascentgame/\n│       ├── automationsaas/\n│       └── dce/\n│\n├── public/                         # Static assets (images, fonts)\n│\n├── package.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n└── next.config.js\n```\n\n## 4. Key Architectural Concepts\n\n-   **Component-Based UI:** The UI will be built by composing small, reusable React components.\n-   **Server Components:** Leverage Next.js Server Components for performance, fetching data on the server where possible.\n-   **Separation of Concerns:** The structure separates pages, shared components, and utility logic.\n-   **DCE-Driven Development:** The entire project will be developed using the DCE extension, with all planning and documentation residing in a `src/Artifacts` directory (to be created in Cycle 1 of that project).\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A116. aiascent.dev - Interactive Whitepaper Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A116: aiascent.dev - Interactive Whitepaper Plan\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** Details the plan to adapt the existing \"Report Viewer\" from aiascent.game into a professional, interactive whitepaper for the DCE project.\n- **Tags:** feature plan, whitepaper, report viewer, showcase, aiascent.dev\n\n## 1. Overview & Goal\n\nA key feature of the `aiascent.dev` website is the \"Interactive Whitepaper.\" This will serve as a compelling and innovative way to present the strategic vision behind the Data Curation Environment (DCE). The goal is to create this feature by adapting the existing \"Report Viewer\" component from the `aiascent.game` project, professionalizing its appearance and loading it with the content from the DCE whitepaper (`A78`).\n\nThis effort serves a dual purpose: it creates a great user experience for reading the whitepaper and acts as a powerful demonstration of reusing complex components built with the DCE workflow.\n\n## 2. User Stories\n\n| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |\n|---|---|---|\n| WP-01 | **Navigate Whitepaper** | As a visitor, I want to navigate the sections and pages of the whitepaper using a tree-like table of contents, so I can easily find the information I'm interested in. | - A side panel displays a hierarchical view of the whitepaper's sections and pages. <br> - Clicking an item in the navigator instantly loads and displays the content for that page. |\n| WP-02 | **View Multimodal Content** | As a visitor, I want to view the whitepaper content, which includes formatted text and associated images, so I can have a rich reading experience. | - The main content area displays the text for the selected page. <br> - An image viewer displays the images associated with that page. |\n| WP-03 | **Professional UI/UX** | As a visitor, I expect the interactive whitepaper to have a clean, professional, and modern design that is distinct from the in-game theme of `aiascent.game`. | - The UI is restyled with a new color palette, typography, and layout suitable for a professional project website. <br> - All game-specific elements (e.g., sci-fi borders, thematic icons) are removed or replaced. |\n\n## 3. Technical Implementation Plan\n\n1.  **Code Porting:**\n    *   The curator will copy the relevant React components for the \"Report Viewer\" from the `aiascent.game` project into the `aiascent-dev` project's `src/components/ReportViewer/` directory.\n    *   The curator will also copy the `reportContent.json` file (which contains the whitepaper text) into the `aiascent-dev` project, likely under `src/lib/data/`.\n\n2.  **Component Adaptation:**\n    *   The main `ReportViewer.tsx` component will be refactored to be a self-contained, reusable component.\n    *   It will be updated to load its content from a local JSON file instead of fetching from a game server API.\n    *   Props will be added to allow for customization of its appearance (e.g., theme, colors).\n\n3.  **Styling (`.scss` or Tailwind):**\n    *   A new stylesheet will be created specifically for the `ReportViewer` component.\n    *   All existing styles will be reviewed and overridden to match the professional aesthetic of the `aiascent.dev` website. This will be the most significant part of the work.\n\n4.  **Integration:**\n    *   The `src/app/whitepaper/page.tsx` file will import and render the newly adapted `ReportViewer` component, passing in the required data.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A117. aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List.md\">\n# Artifact A117: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The definitive list of all documentation artifacts for the aiascent.dev website project.\n- **Tags:** documentation, master artifact list, project setup, aiascent.dev\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nThis is an excellent and comprehensive plan. Your strategy to create a promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) on `aiascent.dev` is sound, and your technical approach for hosting and development is perfectly aligned with modern web practices.\n\nMy course of action is to fully support this new initiative. First, I will confirm the technical details of your hosting plan. Second, I will provide a curated list of essential artifacts from the current DCE project that you should port over to provide context for the new `aiascent-dev` project. Finally, I will \"pre-boot\" the new project by generating a complete starter set of Cycle 0 documentation artifacts, tailored to the goal of building the new promotional website and interactive whitepaper.\n\n</summary>\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Confirm Hosting Strategy:** I will confirm that your plan to point both `aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev` to the same IP address and use your `server.ts` to route traffic based on the request's hostname is a standard and effective method for hosting multiple domains on a single server. This is often referred to as using virtual hosts or server blocks.\n\n2.  **Provide Curated Artifact List:** I will provide a list of key documentation artifacts from the DCE project that are essential for bootstrapping the `aiascent-dev` website. This will ensure the new project has the necessary context regarding the DCE's vision, workflow, and technical architecture.\n\n3.  **Generate Initial Artifacts for `aiascent-dev-website`:** I will generate a complete set of \"Cycle 0\" planning documents for the new project.

Confirming Your Hosting Strategy\n\nYour plan is technically sound and is a common practice for hosting multiple websites on a single server/IP address. Here is the confirmation of the workflow:\n\n1.  **DNS Configuration:** Point the `A` records for both `aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev` to the public IP address of your home server.\n2.  **Server-Side Routing:** In your `server.ts` (or within a reverse proxy like Caddy/Nginx), you will inspect the `Host` header of incoming HTTP requests. Based on whether the host is `aiascent.game` or `aiascent.dev`, you can then route the request to the appropriate application logic (e.g., to the game server or the new DCE website server). For a Next.js application, this can be handled using middleware or API routes to check the request headers.\n\nThis setup will work perfectly for your intended purpose.\n\n### 2. Recommended DCE Artifacts to Port\n\nTo provide the necessary context for the new `aiascent-dev` project, I recommend you copy the following artifacts from this DCE project into your `C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev\\context\\dce` directory.

Key Implementation Steps\n\n1.  **Project Initialization:**\n    *   Initialize a new Next.js project in `C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`.\n    *   Set up the basic file structure as outlined above.\n\n2.  **Component Migration:**\n    *   **Homepage:** Copy the relevant layout and component files from the `automationsaas` project to serve as the shell for `src/app/page.tsx`.\n    *   **Report Viewer:** Copy the `report viewer` component and all its dependencies (child components, state management, utility functions) from the `aiascent.game` project into `src/components/report-viewer/`. This is a straightforward file copy-paste operation.\n    *   **Data:** Copy the `reportContent.json` file into the project, likely in a `/data` or `/lib` directory, so it can be imported and passed to the report viewer component.\n\n3.  **Integration and Styling:**\n    *   Integrate the cloned `ReportViewer` component into the `src/app/whitepaper/page.tsx` page.\n    *   Refactor the component's styling to match the professional aesthetic of the new `aiascent.dev` site, removing any game-specific branding.\n    *   Update the homepage content to be relevant to the DCE extension.\n\n4.  **Server Configuration:**\n    *   Update the main `server.ts` on the host machine to include logic for routing requests for `aiascent.dev` to the new Next.js application's build output.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-website-A7-Development-and-Testing-Guide.md\">\n# Artifact A7: aiascent-dev-website - Development and Testing Guide\n# Date Created: C0\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A step-by-step guide explaining how to run, debug, and test the website locally.\n- **Tags:** development, testing, debugging, workflow\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **AI Ascent Dev Website** application locally.\n\n## 2. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed using npm.\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code and watch for changes, run the following command:```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\nThis will start the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOpen a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the homepage of the website. The development server supports hot-reloading, so any changes you save in the source code will be reflected in the browser automatically.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\nYou can use your browser's developer tools to debug the frontend application. You can set breakpoints, inspect the DOM, and view console logs directly in the browser. For backend debugging of any server-side rendering logic or API routes, you can use the VS Code debugger attached to the Node.js process.\n\n## 3. Testing\n\nThe project will be configured with a testing framework (e.g., Jest with React Testing Library). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-website-A9-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\">\n# Artifact A9: aiascent-dev-website - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n# Date Created: C0\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A guide with the necessary git commands to initialize the project as a local repository and push it to a new remote repository on GitHub.\n- **Tags:** git, github, version control, setup\n\n## 1.

Prerequisites\n\n*   You have `git` installed on your machine.\n*   You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev-website`\n4.  **Description:** Promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions. We will use the section titled **\"...or push an existing repository from the command line\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory (`C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`). Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files:**\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"Initial commit: Cycle 0 planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev-website.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\nAfter these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files. You are now set up to use the DCE and Git to build this new website.\n</file>"

          "content": "<summary>\nThis is an excellent and comprehensive plan. I can confirm that your proposed hosting setup is entirely feasible and a standard industry practice. You can indeed host multiple domains (`aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev`) on a single server with one IP address. The routing is handled by a reverse proxy like Caddy, which inspects the incoming request's `Host` header (`aiascent.game` or `aiascent.dev`) and forwards the traffic to the appropriate backend service or route within your Node.js `server.ts` application. Your existing Caddy setup is well-suited for this.\n\nMy course of action is to execute your plan by providing the two key deliverables you've requested. First, I will create a new planning artifact for the `aiascent-dev` project that includes a curated list of the most relevant DCE artifacts you should port over.

It aims to provide a professional, informative website that will serve as the primary destination for users to learn about, download, and get support for the DCE. The site itself will be a testament to the power of the DCE, as it will be built using the very same artifact-driven, AI-assisted workflow it promotes.\n\n## 2. High-Level Goals & Phases\n\nThe project will be developed in distinct phases to ensure an iterative and manageable workflow.\n\n### Phase 1: Core Website and Interactive Whitepaper\n\nThe goal of this phase is to establish the foundational elements of the project, leveraging existing assets for rapid development.\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Develop a main homepage based on the `automationsaas` project shell, explaining the DCE's value proposition.\n    -   Create an \"Interactive Whitepaper\" section by adapting the report viewer from `aiascent.game`.\n    -   Host the \"Process as Asset\" whitepaper as the initial content for the viewer.\n-   **Outcome:** A live, functional website at `aiascent.dev` that introduces the DCE to the world and showcases a key component built with the DCE methodology.\n\n### Phase 2: Tutorial and \"Vibe Coding\" Hub\n\nThis phase will build upon the foundation of Phase 1 by adding educational content.\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Expand the report viewer to support multiple documents.\n    -   Create and host a series of tutorials on how to \"vibe code\" and use the DCE effectively.\n    -   Add a blog or articles section for development updates and thoughts on AI-assisted workflows.\n-   **Outcome:** `aiascent.dev` becomes a central resource for learning the \"AI Ascent\" development methodology.\n\n### Phase 3: Community and Integration\n\nThis phase focuses on building a community around the DCE and integrating with other platforms.\n-   **Core Functionality:**\n    -   Add links to the official VS Code Marketplace page.\n    -   Integrate with GitHub for issue tracking and community contributions.\n    -   Potentially add a forum or Discord integration for user support.\n-   **Outcome:** A polished and comprehensive hub for the entire DCE project and its user community.\n</file>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-A3-Technical-Scaffolding-Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A3: aiascent-dev - Technical Scaffolding Plan\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A generic template for a technical scaffolding plan.\n- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis document outlines the proposed technical scaffolding and file structure for **aiascent.dev**. This plan serves as a blueprint for the initial project setup, ensuring a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture from the start, leveraging modern web development practices.\n\n## 2. Technology Stack\n\n-   **Language:** TypeScript\n-   **Framework/Library:** React with Next.js (This is recommended for its performance, SEO benefits, and ease of routing, which will be useful for the different sections like the whitepaper).\n-   **Styling:** SCSS or TailwindCSS (To be determined based on the styles of the imported `automationsaas` and `report viewer` components).\n-   **Bundler:** Webpack (Handled automatically by Next.js).\n\n## 3. Proposed File Structure\n\nThe project will adhere to a standard Next.js directory structure:\n\n```\n.\n├── src/\n│   ├── app/                # Next.js App Router for pages and layouts\n│   │   ├── (main)/           # Main website routes\n│   │   │   ├── page.tsx      # Homepage\n│   │   │   └── layout.tsx\n│   │   ├── whitepaper/       # Route group for the interactive whitepaper\n│   │   │   ├── page.tsx\n│   │   │   └── layout.tsx\n│   │   └── global.scss     # Global styles\n│   │\n│   ├── components/         # Reusable React components (e.g., Navbar, Footer)\n│   │   └── report-viewer/  # The adapted report viewer component\n│   │\n│   ├── lib/                # Utility functions, helpers\n│   │\n│   └── content/            # Static content, like the markdown/json for the whitepaper\n│\n├── public/                 # Static assets (images, fonts)\n│\n├── package.json            # Project manifest and dependencies\n└── tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration\n```\n\n## 4. Key Architectural Concepts\n\n-   **Separation of Concerns:** The structure separates pages, reusable UI components, and static content.\n-   **Component-Based UI:** The UI will be built by composing small, reusable components. The core components from `automationsaas` (homepage layout) and `aiascent.game` (report viewer) will be adapted and placed in `src/components/`.\n-   **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Next.js will be used to pre-render the homepage and whitepaper pages as static HTML, ensuring fast load times and good SEO.\n-   **Strong Typing:** TypeScript will be used throughout the project to ensure type safety and improve developer experience.\n</file>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-A7-Development-and-Testing-Guide.md\">\n# Artifact A7: aiascent-dev - Development and Testing Guide\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A generic template for a development and testing guide.\n- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, documentation, project setup\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **aiascent.dev** website locally.\n\n## 2. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed using npm.\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code and watch for changes, run the following command:\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\nThis will start the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`, and automatically recompile your code when you save a file.\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOpen your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the homepage of the `aiascent.dev` website.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\nYou can use your browser's developer tools to debug the frontend React components. For backend (server-side rendering) debugging in Next.js, you can attach the VS Code debugger by creating a `launch.json` configuration.\n\n## 3. Testing\n\nThe project will be configured with a testing framework (e.g., Jest with React Testing Library). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n</file>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-A9-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\">\n# Artifact A9: aiascent-dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n# Date Created: C117\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A generic template for a guide on setting up a new project with Git and GitHub, including a sample workflow.\n- **Tags:** template, cycle 0, git, github, version control, workflow\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local project folder (`C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`) into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines the sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2. Prerequisites\n\n*   You have `git` installed on your machine.\n*   You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** Enter `aiascent-dev`.\n4.  **Description:** (Optional) \"Promotional website and interactive whitepaper for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) project.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files, and this will prevent conflicts.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions. We will use the section titled **\"...or push an existing repository from the command line\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory (`C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`). Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files:**\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"Initial commit: Pre-boot with planning artifacts from DCE C117\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\nAfter these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files.\n\n## 4. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work, without losing your place.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean. You can check this with `git status`. All your previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate a Prompt and Get Responses\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Use this prompt to get multiple responses (e.g., 4 to 8) from your preferred AI model.\n\n### Step 3: Paste and Parse\nPaste the responses into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 4: Accept and Test\n1.  Review the responses and find one that looks promising.\n2.  Select that response and use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Now, compile and test the application (`npm run dev`). Does it work? Does it have errors?\n\n### Step 5: The \"Restore\" Loop\nThis is where Git becomes a powerful part of the workflow.\n\n*   **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs, don't work as expected):**\n    1.  Use the **\"Restore Baseline\"** button in the DCE, or run `git restore .` in the terminal.\n    2.  This command instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    3.  You are now back to a clean state and can go back to the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, select a *different* AI response, and click \"Accept Selected Files\" again to test the next proposed solution.\n\n*   **If the changes are good:**\n    1.  Use the **\"Baseline (Commit)\"** button in the DCE, or use the Source Control panel in VS Code.\n    2.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"Feat: Implement homepage header via AI C5\").\n    3.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle from a new, clean state.\n\nThis iterative loop of `accept -> test -> restore` allows you to rapidly audition multiple AI-generated solutions without fear of corrupting your codebase.\n</file>"

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nAs the senior project architect for `aiascent.dev`, I have completed the project initialization (Cycle 0). I analyzed the project scope (M4) and reviewed the available context, including the flattened repositories of related projects (`automationsaas` and `aiascent.game`).\n\nBased on this analysis, I have developed a strategy that leverages these existing assets to accelerate development. The `automationsaas` project will provide the foundational Next.js/TypeScript/TailwindCSS shell, and the `aiascent.game` project will provide the interactive report viewer component, which will be ported and adapted as the primary showcase feature.\n\nI have generated nine foundational artifacts based on the provided templates (M6 Static Context). This includes the mandatory setup guides (A14 GitHub Setup and A7 Development Guide) and core planning documents that reflect the asset reuse strategy (A1 Vision, A2 Requirements, A3 Technical Plan, A11 Roadmap). I also created the necessary process documents (A16 Environment Setup, A4 Task Checklist) and the Master Artifact List (A0).\n\nNo code files were generated, adhering to the Cycle 0 constraints.

Key Architectural Concepts\n\n  - **Asset Reuse:** The primary architectural concept is the reuse of the `automationsaas` shell. This provides a pre-configured environment with styling, theming, and basic layout structures.\n  - **Component Porting:** The core interactive feature (the viewer) will be ported from `aiascent.game` and encapsulated within the `src/components/whitepaper/` directory.\n  - **Next.js App Router:** Utilizing the file-system-based routing and React Server Components capabilities of the Next.js App Router.\n  - **Decoupling and Simplification:** Removing unnecessary dependencies from the `automationsaas` shell (like authentication, billing, and database logic) to create a lean promotional site.\n    \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A11-aiascentdev-Implementation-Roadmap.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A11: aiascentdev - Implementation Roadmap\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A step-by-step roadmap for the implementation of `aiascent.dev`, focusing on the migration of existing assets and the development of the interactive showcase.\n  - **Tags:** roadmap, implementation, planning, strategy, migration, porting\n\n## 1\\. Overview & Goal\n\nThis document provides a clear, step-by-step roadmap for the implementation of **aiascent.dev**. The roadmap prioritizes the migration of the `automationsaas` shell and the porting of the `aiascent.game` viewer component to rapidly achieve the Phase 1 goals.\n\n## 2\\. Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Shell Migration and Cleanup (Est. Cycle 1-2)\n\n  - **Goal:** Establish the project foundation by migrating and cleaning the `automationsaas` shell.\n  - **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Migration:** Copy the core files from `automationsaas` (`package.json`, configs, `src/app`, `src/components/global`, `src/components/ui`, `src/providers`, `src/lib`).\n    2.  **Dependency Cleanup:** Update `package.json` to remove dependencies not needed for `aiascent.dev` (e.g., Prisma, Stripe, Clerk, specific API clients).\n    3.  **Code Cleanup:** Remove authentication, billing, database access, and API route files from the `src` directory.\n    4.  **Rebranding:** Update the site name, logo, and basic styling in the Navbar and layout files.\n    5.  **Validation:** Ensure the cleaned shell builds and runs (`npm install && npm run dev`).\n  - **Outcome:** A clean, rebranded Next.js application shell ready for feature development.\n\n### Step 2: Interactive Whitepaper - Porting and Refactoring (Est. Cycle 3-5)\n\n  - **Goal:** Port the viewer component from `aiascent.game` and adapt it for the new environment.\n  - **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Identification:** Analyze the `ReportViewer` in `aiascent.game` and identify all dependencies (child components, utility functions, data structures).\n    2.  **Porting:** Copy the relevant files into `src/components/whitepaper/`.\n    3.  **Refactoring:** Rename the component to `InteractiveWhitepaper`. Remove game-specific state management and styling. Adapt it to use local state or a new, dedicated store.\n    4.  **Data Integration:** Define the JSON data structure for the whitepaper and implement the logic to load it from `src/data`.\n  - **Outcome:** A functional, standalone interactive viewer component running within the `aiascent.dev` shell.\n\n### Step 3: Content Integration and UI Development (Est. Cycle 6-8)\n\n  - **Goal:** Integrate the actual whitepaper content and build the remaining UI.\n  - **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Content Conversion:** Convert the DCE whitepaper into the required JSON format.\n    2.  **Page Creation:** Create the `/whitepaper` route and integrate the `InteractiveWhitepaper` component.\n    3.  **Landing Page:** Develop the main landing page (`src/app/page.tsx`) with marketing content about the DCE, adapting the existing `automationsaas` landing page design.\n  - **Outcome:** A feature-complete Phase 1 website.\n\n### Step 4: Polish and Deployment (Est. Cycle 9+)\n\n  - **Goal:** Refine the application and deploy it to production.\n  - **Tasks:**\n    1.  **UI/UX Polish:** Address responsiveness issues and fine-tune styling.\n    2.  **Testing:** Conduct thorough cross-browser testing.\n    3.  **Deployment:** Configure the hosting environment and deploy the website.\n  - **Outcome:** A stable, polished, and publicly accessible website.\n    \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A7-aiascentdev-Development-and-Testing-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A7: aiascentdev - Development and Testing Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Standard procedures for running, debugging, and testing the `aiascent.dev` Next.js application locally.\n  - **Tags:** development, testing, debugging, workflow, nextjs, guide\n\n## 1\\. Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **aiascent.dev** application locally.\n\n## 2\\. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed. This project inherits the configuration from `automationsaas`. Navigate to the project root and run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n# or if using yarn (as specified in automationsaas package.json):\n# yarn install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo start the Next.js development server with hot-reloading, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or:\n# yarn dev\n```\n\nThis will compile the code and watch for changes.\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOnce the development server is running, it will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the configuration). Open this URL in your web browser to view the application. Next.js will automatically update the browser when you save changes to the source files.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\nYou can use your browser's built-in Developer Tools (Inspector, Console, Debugger) to debug the client-side React application.\n\nFor debugging server-side code (e.g., React Server Components or API routes), logs will appear in the terminal where you ran the dev command.\n\n## 3\\. Testing\n\nThe project inherits the testing configuration from `automationsaas` (Jest). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n# or:\n# yarn test\n```\n\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n\n## 4\\. Building for Production\n\nTo create an optimized production build of the application, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n# or:\n# yarn build\n```\n\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A14-aiascentdev-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A14: aiascentdev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A step-by-step guide with the necessary git commands to initialize the `aiascent.dev` project repository and link it to GitHub, including the DCE testing workflow.\n  - **Tags:** git, github, version control, setup, repository, workflow, dce\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines a sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n  * You have `git` installed on your machine.\n  * You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev` (or similar).\n4.  **Description:** \"Promotional and educational website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files (the artifacts generated in Cycle 0):**\n\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with project planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your new GitHub repository page.\n\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\n## 4\\. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle (like Cycle 1), ensure your working directory is clean (`git status` should show nothing to commit).\n\n### Step 2: Generate a Prompt and Get Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file based on the task list (A4). Use this prompt to get multiple responses from your preferred AI model.\n\n### Step 3: Paste and Parse\n\nPaste the responses into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 4: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and find one that looks promising.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button to write the AI's proposed changes (e.g., the migration of the `automationsaas` shell) to your workspace.\n3.  Now, try to build and run the application (`npm install`, `npm run dev`). Does it work?\n\n### Step 5: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n  * **If the changes are bad (e.g., the migration was incomplete, the app doesn't build):**\n\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    3.  This command instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit (Cycle 0).\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response in the DCE panel and try again.\n\n  * **If the changes are good:**\n\n    1.  Open the Source Control panel in VS Code.\n    2.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    3.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Migrate and clean automationsaas shell\").\n    4.  Commit the changes.\n    5.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle (Cycle 2).\n        \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A16-aiascentdev-Developer-Environment-Setup-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A16: aiascentdev - Developer Environment Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A guide for setting up the local development environment, including required tools (Node.js, Git, VS Code) and configuration.\n  - **Tags:** environment, setup, tools, configuration, onboarding, guide\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis document provides a step-by-step guide for setting up the local development environment required to build and run **aiascent.dev**.\n\n## 2\\. System Requirements\n\n  - **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux\n  - **Package Manager:** npm (included with Node.js) or yarn\n  - **Node.js Version:** v18.17.0 or later (LTS recommended, e.g., v20.x)\n  - **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code (Recommended)\n\n## 3\\. Required Tools & Software\n\nPlease install the following tools if you do not already have them:\n\n1.  **Node.js:** Download the LTS version from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).\n2.  **Git:** Download from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n3.  **Visual Studio Code:** Download from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n### Recommended VS Code Extensions\n\n  - ESLint\n  - Prettier - Code formatter\n  - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense\n  - Data Curation Environment (DCE)\n\n## 4\\. Step-by-Step Setup Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Clone the Repository\n\nFirst, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.\n\n```bash\n# Replace with your repository URL\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/aiascent-dev.git\ncd aiascent-dev\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install Project Dependencies\n\nNext, install all the necessary project dependencies.\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n# or yarn install\n```\n\n### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (If Applicable)\n\nIf the project requires environment variables, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project. Next.js automatically loads variables from this file.\n\n```bash\n# Example content for .env.local:\n# NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=UA-XXXXX-Y\n```\n\n### Step 4: Run the Development Server\n\nTo start the local development server, run the following command.\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or yarn dev\n```\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Setup\n\nOnce the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the configuration). You should see the `aiascent.dev` landing page.\n\n## 5\\. Managing Environment Variables and Secrets\n\nTo provide an AI assistant with the necessary context about which environment variables are available without exposing sensitive secrets, follow this best practice:\n\n1.  **Use `.env.local` for secrets:** Keep your actual secrets in `.env.local`.\n2.  **Create a `.env.dce` file (or `.env.example`):** Make a copy of your `.env.local` file.\n3.  **Redact Secret Values:** In the copied file, replace all sensitive values with the placeholder `[REDACTED]`.\n4.  **Include in Context:** When using the DCE, select the redacted file (`.env.dce` or `.env.example`) to include it in the prompt context.\n5.  **Exclude Secrets from Git:** Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes `.env.local` (Next.js default) to prevent your actual secrets from being committed to version control.\n    \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A4-aiascentdev-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A4: aiascentdev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, starting with the migration of the `automationsaas` shell.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, process, planning, workflow, migration\n\n## 1\\.

Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Prerequisites\n\nEnsure you have the following installed:\n\n  - Node.js (LTS version recommended)\n  - npm (or yarn/pnpm)\n\n### Step 2: Install Dependencies\n\nNavigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and install all project dependencies.\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Step 3: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code and start the Next.js development server with hot-reloading, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThis will watch for changes in your source files and automatically update the application in the browser.\n\n### Step 4: Running the Application\n\nOnce the development server is running, you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to:\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3000\n```\n\n### Step 5: Debugging\n\nYou can debug the client-side application using your browser's developer tools (Inspector, Console, Debugger). For server-side code (e.g., API routes or Server Components), you can attach a debugger to the Node.js process or use `console.log` statements which will appear in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running.\n\n## 3\\. Testing\n\nThe project will be configured with a testing framework (e.g., Jest or Cypress). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\n\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console. (Note: Testing framework setup is planned for a future cycle).\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A14. aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A14: aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A guide on setting up the aiascent.dev project with Git and GitHub, including a sample workflow for using Git with the DCE.\n  - **Tags:** git, github, version control, workflow, setup, guide\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines a sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n  * You have `git` installed on your machine.\n  * You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev`.\n4.  **Description:** (Optional) \"Promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"C0: Initial project setup and planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\n## 4\\. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean (check with `git status`). All previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate and Parse Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Get multiple responses from your AI model, paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 3: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and select a promising one.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Compile and test the application (e.g., `npm run dev`). Does it work? Does it have errors?\n\n### Step 4: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\nThis is where Git integrates seamlessly with the workflow.\n\n  * **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs):**\n\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    3.  This command instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response in the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and test the next solution.\n\n  * **If the changes are good:**\n\n    1.  Open the Source Control panel in VS Code.\n    2.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    3.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding\").\n    4.  Commit the changes.\n    5.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle.\n\nThis iterative loop of `accept -> test -> restore` allows you to rapidly audition multiple AI-generated solutions without fear of corrupting your codebase.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A17. aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A17: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1\\.

Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Foundational Setup & Scaffolding (Cycle 1)\n\n\\-   **Goal:** Create the basic project structure and initialize the development environment.\n\\-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Initialize Project:** Set up the Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS (A3).\n    2.  **Version Control:** Initialize the Git repository and push to GitHub (A14).\n    3.  **Basic Layout:** Implement the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) with placeholder Header and Footer components.\n\\-   **Outcome:** A runnable Next.js application with the core technical structure in place.\n\n### Step 2: Landing Page UI Development (Cycle 2-3)\n\n\\-   **Goal:** Build the main landing page UI and core navigation.\n\\-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Header & Footer:** Implement the functional Header and Footer components.\n    2.  **Hero Section:** Create the main hero section with the headline and primary CTA.\n    3.  **Features Section:** Implement the section detailing the key benefits of the DCE.\n    4.  **Styling & Responsiveness:** Apply the visual design using TailwindCSS and ensure responsiveness.\n\\-   **Outcome:** A visually complete and responsive landing page.\n\n### Step 3: Interactive Showcase Implementation (Cycle 4-6)\n\n\\-   **Goal:** Develop the core feature of Phase 1: the interactive showcase component.\n\\-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Data Structure:** Define and create the JSON data source (`src/data/whitepaperContent.json`).\n    2.  **Showcase Page:** Create the `/showcase` page route.\n    3.  **Component Development:** Build the `InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx` component, including data loading and navigation logic.\n    4.  **Integration:** Integrate the component into the showcase page with accompanying explanatory text.\n\\-   **Outcome:** A functional interactive showcase that demonstrates the DCE's capabilities.\n\n### Step 4: Polish, Testing, and Deployment (Cycle 7+)\n\n\\-   **Goal:** Finalize the content, fix bugs, and deploy the website.\n\\-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Content Finalization:** Review and finalize all text content and imagery.\n    2.  **Cross-Browser/Device Testing:** Ensure the website works correctly across major browsers and devices.\n    3.  **SEO Optimization:** Implement basic SEO metadata.\n    4.  **Deployment:** Configure the hosting environment and deploy the application.\n\\-   **Outcome:** The Phase 1 website is live and accessible to the public.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A7-Development-and-Testing-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A7: aiascent.dev - Development and Testing Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A guide providing the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the aiascent.dev Next.js website locally.\n  - **Tags:** documentation, project setup, development, testing, nextjs, workflow\n\n## 1\\. Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **aiascent.dev** application locally.\n\n## 2\\. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed. Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n# or if using yarn\n# yarn install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code and start the Next.js development server with hot-reloading, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOnce the development server is running, it will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your web browser to view the application. The server will automatically refresh the page when you save changes to the source files.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\nDebugging is primarily done using the browser's developer tools (DevTools).\n\n  - **Client-Side Debugging:** Open DevTools (F12 or right-click -\\> Inspect) and navigate to the \"Console\" tab for logs or the \"Sources\" (Chrome/Edge) / \"Debugger\" (Firefox) tab to set breakpoints directly in the TypeScript source code (thanks to source maps).\n  - **React State:** Install the React Developer Tools browser extension to inspect component state and props.\n\n## 3\\. Testing\n\nThe project will be configured with a testing framework (e.g., Jest and React Testing Library) as development progresses. To run the test suite, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\n\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n\n## 4\\. Building for Production\n\nTo create an optimized production build of the application, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis generates the necessary files for deployment. You can then run the production build locally using:\n\n```bash\nnpm run start\n```\n\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A14-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A14: aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A guide on setting up the aiascent.dev project with Git and GitHub, including the essential workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n  - **Tags:** git, github, version control, workflow, setup, dce\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines the standard workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n\\*   You have `git` installed on your machine.\n\\*   You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev` (or similar).\n4.  **Description:** \"Promotional and educational website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n    ` bash     git init      `\n\n2.  **Create/Update `.gitignore`:** Ensure you have a `.gitignore` file. Crucially, it must include `.vscode/` to prevent DCE state files from causing issues, along with standard Next.js ignores. You can create a basic one with:\n    ```bash\n    echo \"node_modules/\\n.next/\\n.env.local\\n.vscode/\" > .gitignore\n    ```\n\n3.  **Add all existing files:**\n    ` bash     git add .      `\n\n4.  **Create the first commit:**\n    ` bash     git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with project artifacts\"      `\n\n5.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n    ` bash     git branch -M main      `\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n    ` bash     git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git      `\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n    ` bash     git push -u origin main      `\n\n## 4\\. Standard Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is essential for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean (`git status`). All previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate and Parse Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Get multiple responses from your AI model, paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 3: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and select one that looks promising.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button (or the integrated \"Baseline\" feature if available) to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Compile and test the website (`npm run dev`). Does it work? Are there errors?\n\n### Step 4: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n\\*   **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs):**\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    3.  This instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response in the DCE panel and test the next solution.\n\n\\*   **If the changes are good:**\n    1.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    2.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding\").\n    3.  Commit the changes (`git commit -m \"...\"`).\n    4.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A4: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1\\.

Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add all existing files:** (Ensure you have a proper `.gitignore` file first, which will be created in Cycle 1)\n\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n3.  **Create the first commit:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with project planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\nAfter these commands complete, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all of your project files.\n\n## 4\\. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is crucial for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean (`git status`). All your previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate a Prompt and Get Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Use this prompt to get multiple responses from your AI model.\n\n### Step 3: Paste and Parse\n\nPaste the responses into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 4: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and select one that looks promising.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button (or the integrated \"Baseline & Accept\" feature if available in your DCE version) to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Now, compile and test the application (`npm run dev`). Does the website look correct? Does the new feature work?\n\n### Step 5: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n  * **If the changes are bad (e.g., introduce bugs, break the layout):**\n\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .` (or use the DCE's integrated \"Restore Baseline\" button).\n    3.  This instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response in the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel and test the next proposed solution.\n\n  * **If the changes are good:**\n\n    1.  Open the Source Control panel in VS Code.\n    2.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    3.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding\").\n    4.  Commit the changes.\n    5.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle from a new, clean state.\n        \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent-dev-A17-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A17: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, bugs, and progress for the aiascent.dev website, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1\\.

Purpose\n\nThis guide provides the standard procedure for running, debugging, and testing the **aiascent.dev** application locally, based on the Next.js framework inherited from the `automationsaas` shell.\n\n## 2\\. Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Install Dependencies\n\nEnsure all project dependencies are installed. Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run the appropriate command based on the package manager used in the `automationsaas` shell (check `package.json` or look for lock files).\n\n```bash\n# If using npm\nnpm install\n\n# If using yarn (common in automationsaas)\n# yarn install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start the Development Server\n\nTo compile the code, watch for changes, and enable Fast Refresh (hot-reloading), run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or\n# yarn dev\n```\n\nThis will start the Next.js development server.\n\n### Step 3: Running the Application\n\nOnce the development server is running, the application will typically be available at:\n`http://localhost:3000`\n\nOpen this URL in your web browser. The browser will automatically update when you make changes to the source code.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\n  - **Client-Side Debugging:** Use your browser's Developer Tools (DevTools) to inspect components, monitor network requests, and view console logs.\n  - **Server-Side Debugging:** Logs from server-side rendering or API routes will appear directly in the terminal where the dev server is running.\n\n## 3\\. Testing\n\nThe project inherits the testing configuration from the `automationsaas` shell (likely Jest). To run the test suite, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n# or\n# yarn test\n```\n\nThis will execute all test files located in the project and report the results to the console.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent.dev-A14-GitHub-Repository-Setup-Guide.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A14: aiascent.dev - GitHub Repository Setup Guide\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A step-by-step guide with the necessary git commands to initialize the aiascent.dev project repository and establish the standard DCE testing workflow.\n  - **Tags:** git, github, version control, setup, repository, workflow, dce\n\n## 1\\. Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to GitHub, and outlines the standard workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n  * You have `git` installed on your machine.\n  * You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  Click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev`.\n4.  **Description:** \"Promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing the files generated in Cycle 0 and the `automationsaas` shell.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    ```\n\n2.  **Ensure `.gitignore` is correct:** The `.gitignore` file should be inherited from the `automationsaas` shell in Cycle 1. It is crucial that it includes `.vscode/` to prevent the DCE extension's state files from being committed.\n\n3.  **Add all existing files:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    ```\n\n4.  **Create the first commit:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with project planning artifacts\"\n    ```\n\n5.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git branch -M main\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your new GitHub repository page.\n\n    ```bash\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git\n    ```\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin main\n    ```\n\n## 4\\. Standard Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is essential for the DCE workflow, enabling rapid testing and clean reversions of AI-generated code.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle (e.g., Cycle 1), ensure your working directory is clean (check with `git status`).\n\n### Step 2: Generate and Parse Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate `prompt.md`. Get multiple AI responses, paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, and \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 3: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Select the most promising response.\n2.  Use **\"Accept Selected Files\"** (or the \"Baseline/Accept\" flow if implemented in your DCE version) to write the changes to your workspace.\n3.  Run the application (e.g., `npm run dev`) and test the changes.\n\n### Step 4: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n  * **If the changes are bad (e.g., bugs, undesired outcome):**\n\n    1.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    2.  This instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting to the last commit.\n    3.  You are now clean and can select a *different* AI response in the Panel and try again.\n\n  * **If the changes are good:**\n\n    1.  Stage the changes (`git add .`).\n    2.  Write a commit message (e.g., \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding from automationsaas\").\n    3.  Commit the changes.\n    4.  You are now ready for the next development cycle.\n        \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent.dev-A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n## 1\\.

Overview\n\nThis guide provides the necessary commands to turn your local `aiascent.dev` project folder into a Git repository, link it to a new repository on GitHub, and outlines a sample workflow for using Git alongside the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. Prerequisites\n\n\\*   You have `git` installed on your machine.\n\\*   You have a GitHub account.\n\n## 3\\. Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub\n\n1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.\n2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **\"New repository\"**.\n3.  **Repository name:** `aiascent-dev`.\n4.  **Description:** (Optional) \"Promotional website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.\"\n5.  Choose **\"Private\"** or **\"Public\"**.\n6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** initialize the repository with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or `license`. We will be pushing our existing files.\n7.  Click **\"Create repository\"**.\n\nGitHub will now show you a page with command-line instructions.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following commands one by one.\n\n1.  **Initialize the repository:**\n    ` bash     git init      `\n\n2.  **Add a .gitignore (Important for Next.js and DCE):**\n    Ensure a `.gitignore` file exists in the root directory (Next.js usually creates one). Crucially, ensure it ignores `.vscode/` to prevent DCE state files from causing issues.\n    ```\n    # Example entries:\n    node_modules\n    .next/\n    .env.local\n    # DCE History (Crucial)\n    .vscode/\n    ```\n\n3.  **Add all existing files:**\n    ` bash     git add .      `\n\n4.  **Create the first commit:**\n    ` bash     git commit -m \"C0: Initial commit with documentation artifacts\"      `\n\n5.  **Rename the default branch to `main`:**\n    ` bash     git branch -M main      `\n\n### Step 3: Link and Push to GitHub\n\n1.  **Add the remote repository:** Replace the placeholder URL with the one from your GitHub repository page.\n    ` bash     git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiascent-dev.git      `\n\n2.  **Push your local `main` branch to GitHub:**\n    ` bash     git push -u origin main      `\n\n## 4\\. Sample Development Workflow with DCE and Git\n\nGit is a powerful tool for managing the iterative changes produced by the DCE. It allows you to quickly test an AI's proposed solution and revert it cleanly if it doesn't work.\n\n### Step 1: Start with a Clean State\n\nBefore starting a new cycle, ensure your working directory is clean (`git status`). All your previous changes should be committed.\n\n### Step 2: Generate and Parse Responses\n\nUse the DCE to generate a `prompt.md` file. Get multiple responses from your AI model, paste them into the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel, and click \"Parse All\".\n\n### Step 3: Accept and Test\n\n1.  Review the responses and select one that looks promising.\n2.  Use the **\"Accept Selected Files\"** button to write the AI's proposed changes to your workspace.\n3.  Compile and test the application (`npm run dev`). Does it work? Does it have errors?\n\n### Step 4: The \"Restore\" Loop\n\n\\*   **If the changes are bad:**\n    1.  Open the terminal in VS Code.\n    2.  Run the command: `git restore .`\n    3.  This instantly discards all uncommitted changes, reverting your files to the state of your last commit.\n    4.  You are now back to a clean state and can select a *different* AI response to test.\n\n\\*   **If the changes are good:**\n    1.  Stage the changes: `git add .`\n    2.  Commit the changes: `git commit -m \"C1: Implement Next.js scaffolding\"`\n    3.  You are now ready to start the next development cycle.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/aiascent.dev-A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A4: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** The primary task tracking document for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity for efficient workflow management.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1\\.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis is Cycle 1, dedicated to the initial scaffolding of the `aiascent.dev` project as detailed in A3 (Technical Scaffolding Plan) and A4 (Task Checklist T-1).\n\nI have generated the complete foundational structure for a modern Next.js application using the App Router, configured with TypeScript and TailwindCSS. Furthermore, I have integrated the Shadcn/ui component library, as suggested optionally in A3, to provide a robust foundation for rapid UI development.\n\nThis includes all necessary configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `components.json`, etc.), core utility files (`src/lib/utils.ts`), the theme provider setup (`src/providers/theme-provider.tsx`), and the initial application layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`). I also generated the base UI components required for the layout (`Button.tsx`, `DropdownMenu.tsx`) and the `ModeToggle.tsx` component, along with placeholder Header, Footer, and Showcase components/data as defined in A3.\n\nThe project is now initialized and ready for dependency installation and local execution.\n\n**Files Updated/Created:**\n\n  * .gitignore\n  * components.json\n  * next.config.mjs\n  * package.json\n  * postcss.config.mjs\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/globals.css\n  * src/app/layout.tsx\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/app/showcase/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/mode-toggle.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n  * src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/button.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx\n  * src/data/whitepaperContent.json\n  * src/lib/utils.ts\n  * src/providers/theme-provider.tsx\n  * tailwind.config.ts\n  * tsconfig.json\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Create `package.json`:** Define project metadata and dependencies for Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn/ui related libraries.\n2.  **Create Configuration Files:** Generate `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `next.config.mjs`, and `components.json`.\n3.  **Create `.gitignore`:** Ensure standard Next.js and DCE directories (`.vscode/`) are ignored.\n4.  **Create Utility Files:** Generate `src/lib/utils.ts` (for `cn` helper) and `src/providers/theme-provider.tsx`.\n5.  **Create Core Application Files:** Implement `src/app/globals.css`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, and a placeholder `src/app/page.tsx`.\n6.  **Create Base UI Components:** Generate `src/components/ui/button.tsx` and `src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx` (required for ModeToggle).\n7.  **Create Layout Components:** Generate `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`, and `src/components/global/mode-toggle.tsx`.\n8.  **Create Showcase Placeholders:** Generate `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` and `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`.\n9.  **Create Data Placeholder:** Generate `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`.\n10. **Update A4 Checklist:** Mark Task T-1 (Project Scaffolding) as completed.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\n\n1.  **Install Dependencies:** Please run `npm install` (or `yarn install`/`pnpm install`) in the project root directory after accepting these files to install the dependencies defined in `package.json`.\n2.  **Start Development Server:** Run `npm run dev` to verify the initial setup.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis is Cycle 1, dedicated to initializing the `aiascent.dev` project scaffolding as outlined in the Technical Scaffolding Plan (A3) and Task T-1 of the Universal Task Checklist (A4). The objective is to establish a robust, modern foundation using Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, incorporating the structure for the shadcn/ui component library from the outset.\n\nI have generated the complete foundational setup by creating all necessary configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, etc.), utility files (`src/lib/utils.ts`), and providers (`ThemeProvider`). I utilized configuration patterns observed in the `automationsaas` context (M7) as a reference for best practices in this technology stack.\n\nThe core application structure is established, including the root layout, global styles, and the initial landing page. Placeholder components for the Header and Footer have been created, integrating a functional theme toggle (ModeToggle).\n\nFurthermore, the scaffolding for the Interactive Showcase feature has been created according to A3. This includes the data placeholder (`src/data/whitepaperContent.json`), the showcase page (`src/app/showcase/page.tsx`), and the interactive component (`src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`). The data loading strategy is implemented correctly: the JSON is imported in the server component (`showcase/page.tsx`) and passed as a prop to the client component (`InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`).\n\nFinally, I updated the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to mark T-1 as complete and provided instructions for the curator to initialize the project.\n\n**Files Created/Updated:**\n\n  * .eslintrc.json\n  * .gitignore\n  * components.json\n  * next.config.mjs\n  * next-env.d.ts\n  * package.json\n  * postcss.config.mjs\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/globals.css\n  * src/app/layout.tsx\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/app/showcase/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/mode-toggle.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n  * src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/button.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx\n  * src/data/whitepaperContent.json\n  * src/lib/utils.ts\n  * src/providers/theme-provider.tsx\n  * tailwind.config.ts\n  * tsconfig.json\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Generate Configuration Files:** Create `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `next.config.mjs`, `.gitignore`, `components.json`, `.eslintrc.json`, and `next-env.d.ts`.\n2.  **Generate Utility Files:** Create `src/lib/utils.ts` (for `cn` helper).\n3.  **Generate Providers and Theming:** Create `src/providers/theme-provider.tsx` and `src/components/global/mode-toggle.tsx`.\n4.  **Generate Core Application Structure:** Create `src/app/globals.css`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, and `src/app/page.tsx`.\n5.  **Generate Layout Components:** Create `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` and `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`.\n6.  **Generate Showcase Structure:** Create `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`, `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`, and `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`. Implement the data loading strategy (import in server component, pass to client component).\n7.  **Generate Basic UI Components:** Create necessary shadcn/ui components (`Button.tsx`, `DropdownMenu.tsx`).\n8.  **Update A4 Checklist:** Mark Task T-1 as complete and prepare for T-2.\n9.  **Provide Curator Instructions:** Outline steps to install dependencies and run the project.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\nAfter accepting these files, please perform the following actions in your terminal at the project root (`C:\\Projects\\aiascent-dev`):\n\n1.  **Install Dependencies:**\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n    *(Note: If you prefer using yarn, as indicated in the `packageManager` field of `package.json`, you can run `yarn install` instead.)*\n\n2.  **Initialize Git and Commit:** (As detailed in A14, the `.gitignore` file is included in this response)\n\n    ```bash\n    git init\n    git add .\n    git commit -m \"C1: Initialize Next.js project scaffolding and structure\"\n    git branch -M main\n    # Add your remote and push if ready (see A14 for details)\n    ```\n\n3.  **Start the Development Server:**\n\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n\n4.  **Verify:** Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to ensure the basic application is running.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nCycle 1: Project Initialization and Scaffolding.\n\nThe objective of this cycle is to initialize the `aiascent.dev` project by creating the foundational scaffolding as outlined in the Technical Scaffolding Plan (A3) and Task T-1 of the Universal Task Checklist (A4).\n\nI have generated the core configuration files required for a modern Next.js application utilizing the App Router, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. This includes:\n\n  - `package.json` with necessary dependencies (including common utilities like `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `tailwindcss-animate`, and `lucide-react`).\n  - `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration.\n  - TailwindCSS setup files (`tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`).\n  - `next.config.mjs` for Next.js configuration.\n  - A comprehensive `.gitignore` file, including the crucial `.vscode/` ignore for DCE compatibility.\n\nFurthermore, I established the initial application structure: the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`), the global stylesheet (`src/app/globals.css`) with standard CSS variables for theming, and a placeholder home page (`src/app/page.tsx`). I also included `src/lib/utils.ts` (for the `cn` helper).\n\nTo establish the planned architecture (A3), I generated functional placeholder files for the layout components (`Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`), the showcase page (`src/app/showcase/page.tsx`), the interactive component (`InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`), and the data source (`src/data/whitepaperContent.json`).\n\nFinally, I updated the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to reflect the completion of T-1.\n\nThe project is now scaffolded and ready for the curator to install dependencies and begin development.\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Create `package.json`**: Define project metadata and dependencies for Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and common utilities.\n2.  **Create `tsconfig.json`**: Set up TypeScript configuration suitable for Next.js.\n3.  **Create `tailwind.config.ts`**: Initialize the TailwindCSS configuration using a standard structure compatible with modern practices (like shadcn/ui).\n4.  **Create `postcss.config.mjs`**: Configuration file required for TailwindCSS processing.\n5.  **Create `next.config.mjs`**: Basic Next.js configuration file.\n6.  **Create `.gitignore`**: Define files and directories to be ignored by Git, including Next.js defaults and DCE specifics (`.vscode/`).\n7.  **Create `src/lib/utils.ts`**: Create the `cn` utility function for Tailwind class merging.\n8.  **Create `src/app/globals.css`**: Global stylesheet containing Tailwind directives and CSS variables for theming.\n9.  **Create `src/app/layout.tsx`**: The root layout for the application using the App Router, integrating Header and Footer.\n10. **Create `src/app/page.tsx`**: The main landing page (placeholder content).\n11. **Create Placeholder Structure Files**: Generate functional placeholders for `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`, `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`.\n12. **Create Placeholder Data**: Generate `src/data/whitepaperContent.json` with sample data.\n13. **Update `A4.

Purpose & Vision\n\nThe Showcase page serves as the \"proof\" for the claims made on the Home page. Its sole purpose is to present a complex, high-quality, interactive component that was itself built using the Data Curation Environment (DCE). This creates a powerful, self-referential demonstration of the tool's power. The page should be clean and focused, putting the showcase component front and center.\n\n## 2. Page Structure & Components\n\n### 2.1. Page Header\n\n*   **Headline:** \"The Proof is the Product\"\n*   **Sub-headline:** \"This interactive report viewer is a complex, data-driven component built from the ground up using the DCE. It demonstrates how the tool facilitates the creation of sophisticated, multi-file features through a structured, iterative workflow.\"\n\n### 2.2. The Showcase Component Container\n\n*   **Component:** `<InteractiveWhitepaper />`\n*   **Layout:** The component will be housed within a clean container, styled to look like a modern application window or a sophisticated presentation view. It should have a subtle border and box-shadow to lift it off the page.\n*   **Data Source:** The component will be fed data from `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`. Initially, this can be the placeholder content, but it will eventually be populated with content from \"The Ascent Report\" (from the `aiascent.game` context).\n\n### 2.3. \"How It Was Built\" Section\n\n*   **Headline:** \"Behind the Curtain: The DCE Workflow\"\n*   **Content:** A brief, step-by-step narrative explaining how a feature like this is built using the DCE. This makes the development process tangible for the user.\n    1.  **Step 1: Documentation First:** \"We started by creating blueprint artifacts (like this one) to define the vision, architecture, and data model.\"\n    2.  **Step 2: Context Curation:** \"Using the DCE's File Tree View, we selected all relevant files—React components, state management stores, and data schemas—to create a precise context for our AI.\"\n    3.  **Step 3: Iterative Generation:** \"We prompted the AI to generate the code, file by file. We used the Parallel Co-Pilot Panel to compare different AI approaches for the navigation logic, selecting the most efficient one.\"\n    4.  **Step 4: Test & Refine:** \"After accepting the AI's code, we tested it. When a bug was found, we used `git restore .` to revert, curated a more specific context, refined the prompt, and generated a better solution in the next cycle.\"\n*   **Visual Element (Optional but effective):** A simplified, animated diagram or a short video/GIF showing the DCE UI in action (the FTV selection -> PCPP response -> code appearing in the editor).\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A18. aiascent.dev - Vision Page Blueprint.md\">\n# Artifact A18: aiascent.dev - Vision Page Blueprint\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A blueprint for the Vision page, a narrative-driven section of the site dedicated to the \"Why\" behind the DCE and the \"Citizen Architect\" concept.\n- **Tags:** blueprint, planning, vision, philosophy, citizen architect\n\n## 1. Purpose & Vision\n\nThis page is the heart of the website's mission. It moves beyond the technical features of the DCE to explain the philosophy and aiascent's long-term vision. The goal is to inspire and resonate with developers who are not just looking for a better tool, but for a more meaningful way to engage with their craft in the age of AI. It directly addresses the user's goal of cultivating 'sleeper citizen agents/architects'.\n\nThe tone should be thoughtful, inspiring, and slightly provocative.\n\n## 2. Page Structure & Narrative Flow\n\nThis page will be structured as a long-form narrative, broken into clear sections with compelling headlines.\n\n### 2.1. Section 1: The Fork in the Road\n\n*   **Headline:** \"AI Presents a Choice: Become a Ghost in the Machine, or its Architect.\"\n*   **Content:**\n    *   Start by acknowledging the anxiety and uncertainty many developers feel about AI. Frame the current moment as a critical choice.\n    *   **Path 1: The Ghost Worker.** Describe the dystopian path where developers become low-paid \"human API endpoints,\" mindlessly fixing the output of a black-box AI, their skills devalued and their agency gone. This connects to the \"Fissured Workplace\" concept.\n    *   **Path 2: The Citizen Architect.** Introduce the alternative: a future where AI handles the drudgery, freeing human intellect to focus on what matters—creativity, strategy, and architecture. This is the path of empowerment.\n\n### 2.2. Section 2: The 100x Multiplier is Real\n\n*   **Headline:** \"This Isn't About Working 10% Faster. It's About Building 100x Bigger.\"\n*   **Content:**\n    *   Argue that the true revolution of AI isn't incremental productivity gains. It's a paradigm shift in the scale of what a single person can create.\n    *   Define the \"Citizen Architect\" as the individual who has mastered this new paradigm. They don't just write code; they orchestrate systems. They are the solo creators who can now build what once required a venture-funded startup.\n    *   Use `aiascent.game` and `aiascent.dev` as the primary evidence. \"A single developer built a real-time multiplayer game and this website. That isn't a boast; it's a signal of a new reality.\"\n\n### 2.3. Section 3: The Tool for Architects\n\n*   **Headline:** \"You Can't Build a Skyscraper with a Screwdriver.\"\n*   **Content:**\n    *   Argue that standard AI chat interfaces are insufficient for this new paradigm. They are conversational, not architectural.\n    *   Introduce the DCE as the tool purpose-built for the Citizen Architect. Explain how its core features (Context Curation, Parallel Co-Pilot, Iterative Workflow) are designed to support a structured, systems-level approach to AI development.\n    *   Frame the DCE not as a replacement for the developer, but as a \"cognitive exoskeleton\"—a tool that amplifies their architectural vision.\n\n### 2.4. Section 4: A Call to Action\n\n*   **Headline:** \"The Future is Unwritten. It's Time to Build.\"\n*   **Content:**\n    *   End with a direct and inspiring call to action. This is where the 'cognitive capitalist' and 'sleeper agent' themes are made explicit, but framed positively.\n    *   \"The power to build the future is being decentralized. An army of individual creators, of cognitive capitalists, can out-innovate any top-down, centralized system. This is the American counter-strategy in the global AI race—a bet on the distributed genius of free people.\"\n    *   \"Download the DCE. Start a project. Master the workflow. Become an architect of your own ascent.\"\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A19. aiascent.dev - Documentation Hub Blueprint.md\">\n# Artifact A19: aiascent.dev - Documentation Hub Blueprint\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A blueprint for the Documentation Hub, which will serve as the central repository for tutorials, guides, and educational content for the DCE.\n- **Tags:** blueprint, planning, documentation, tutorials, guides\n\n## 1. Purpose & Vision\n\nThe Documentation Hub is a critical component for fostering adoption and teaching the \"citizen architect\" methodology. It will be the go-to resource for users to learn how to install, use, and master the Data Curation Environment (DCE). The content should be clear, practical, and organized, guiding users from basic setup to advanced workflows.\n\nThis hub will evolve over time, but this blueprint establishes the foundational structure.\n\n## 2.

Purpose & Goal\n\nThe Showcase page serves as the tangible **proof** of the claims made on the homepage. Its primary goal is to host the `InteractiveWhitepaper` component, demonstrating a complex, data-driven application that was itself built using the Data Curation Environment (DCE). The page must frame this component correctly, explaining to the user what they are seeing and why it is significant.\n\n## 2. Page Structure & Content\n\nThe page will have a simple, clean layout that focuses the user's attention on the interactive component itself.\n\n### Section 1: Page Header\n\n*   **Component:** Standard page header section.\n*   **Headline (H1):** `Interactive Showcase: The Ascent Report`\n*   **Sub-headline:** `This interactive report viewer is a real, functional component built entirely with the Data Curation Environment. It demonstrates how a single developer—a \"Citizen Architect\"—can use the DCE to build complex, data-driven applications by collaborating with an AI.`\n\n### Section 2: The Interactive Component\n\n*   **Component:** A large, bordered container that prominently features the `<InteractiveWhitepaper />` component.\n*   **Implementation:** The `showcase/page.tsx` will import the component and the static JSON data (`whitepaperContent.json`), passing the data as a prop. This leverages Next.js Server Components for efficient data loading.\n*   **Content:** The `InteractiveWhitepaper` component will render the content from the JSON file, allowing users to navigate through pages and sections as defined in its own logic.\n\n### Section 3: Explanatory \"How it Was Built\" Section\n\n*   **Component:** A two-column section placed directly below the interactive component container.\n*   **Purpose:** To connect the showcase back to the DCE product.\n*   **Left Column (Text):**\n    *   **Headline (H2):** `From a Vibe to a Component`\n    *   **Body:** Briefly explain the development process.\n        1.  **Phase 1: Vision (Documentation):** \"The process began by creating blueprint artifacts (like this one!) that defined the vision, features, and data structure for the component.\"\n        2.  **Phase 2: Collaboration (AI Prompting):** \"Using the DCE, these blueprints were combined with existing code to create a rich context for an AI. The AI was then prompted to generate the React components, state management logic, and data-loading mechanisms.\"\n        3.  **Phase 3: Curation (Test & Iterate):** \"Multiple AI responses were parsed, compared, and tested in parallel using the PCPP. The best solutions were accepted, and the `git restore` workflow was used to quickly discard failing approaches, leading to rapid, iterative progress.\"\n*   **Right Column (Visual):**\n    *   A simplified visual of the DCE workflow loop: `Artifacts -> DCE Context -> AI -> PCPP -> Final Code`.\n\n### Section 4: Final Call to Action\n\n*   **Component:** A simple, centered CTA section.\n*   **Headline (H2):** `Ready to Build Your Own Showcase?`\n*   **CTA Button:** `Get Started on GitHub`.\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A22-Tutorials-Page-Blueprint.md\">\n# Artifact A22: aiascent.dev - Tutorials Page Blueprint\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A placeholder blueprint for the future \"Tutorials\" section of the aiascent.dev website, aligning with Phase 2 of the project roadmap.\n- **Tags:** tutorials, documentation, blueprint, design, phase 2, roadmap\n\n## 1.

Content Strategy\n\n### 3.1. The Philosophy (The Citizen Architect)\n\n  * Introduce the core problem: AI is powerful, but current interfaces (like standard chat) are unstructured, leading to inefficiency, lack of reproducibility, and wasted potential.\n  * Introduce the solution: The DCE provides the necessary structure to turn AI interaction into an engineering discipline.\n  * Emphasize the strategic goal: To empower a wave of \"Citizen Architects\"—developers capable of leveraging AI to build and maintain complex systems, thereby increasing national \"Cognitive Capital\" and countering adversarial AI strategies (e.g., China's centralized approach).\n\n### 3.2. The Methodology\n\n  * Focus on the \"Documentation First\" approach.\n  * Explain what an \"Artifact\" is in the DCE context (a \"Source of Truth\" document).\n  * Explain why this approach is superior for large projects: clarity, consistency, and shared understanding between human and AI collaborators.\n\n### 3.3. The Workflow\n\n  * Use the Workflow Diagram (DIAG-01) as the centerpiece.\n  * Provide a narrative description of each step in the \"perfect loop,\" emphasizing the benefits at each stage (e.g., precision in curation, rapid testing in the restore loop).\n\n### 3.4. Key Features\n\n  * Provide detailed explanations of the main UI components of the extension.\n  * Use focused screenshots (IMG-03, IMG-04) to illustrate each feature.\n  * Explain the benefit of each feature (e.g., FTV ensures precise context; PCPP enables parallel exploration and risk mitigation).\n\n## 4\\. Next Steps (Implementation - Future Cycle)\n\n1.  **Create Page Route:** Create `src/app/about-dce/page.tsx`.\n2.  **Content Drafting:** Begin drafting the content for each section based on the strategy above.\n3.  **Asset Integration:** Integrate the required diagrams and screenshots as they become available (see A15).\n    \\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A19-Page-Design-Tutorials-Blog.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A19: aiascent.dev - Page Design - Tutorials and Blog\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Design blueprint for the Tutorials and Blog section, outlining the structure for educational content delivery.\n  - **Tags:** design, tutorials, blog, education, content marketing, mdx\n\n## 1\\. Page Overview and Goals\n\nThe Tutorials and Blog section (Phase 2 goal) is crucial for user adoption and education. It will host articles, guides, and development updates related to the Data Curation Environment (DCE). The goal is to teach the DCE methodology, provide practical examples, and foster a community around the tool.\n\n**Key Message:** Master the DCE workflow and become a more effective Citizen Architect.\n\n## 2\\. Technical Approach (Future State)\n\nWhile the initial implementation might use static React components, the long-term plan is to leverage MDX (Markdown + JSX) for content creation. This allows for rich, interactive content embedded within easily editable Markdown files.\n\n  * **Content Management:** Articles will be stored as `.mdx` files.\n  * **Rendering:** Next.js provides excellent support for MDX, allowing us to render these files as pages with custom layouts.\n\n## 3\\. Layout and Structure\n\nThe section will have two main views: the Index/Listing view and the Article/Detail view.\n\n### 3.1.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThe project is successfully initialized and built. In Cycle 2, we are focusing on detailed planning, asset management, and initiating the implementation of the homepage design based on the provided context.\n\nI have created a new artifact, **A15 (Asset Wishlist)**, detailing the necessary images for the website, prioritizing the DCE interface screenshot for the hero section. To facilitate asset placement, I have created placeholder files (text files with `.png` extensions for visibility) to establish the `public/images/` directory structure.\n\nNext, I have created a comprehensive blueprint for the website by generating dedicated design artifacts for the key pages:\n\n  - **A16 (Homepage Design):** Focusing on a compelling hero section using the `ContainerScroll` animation (inspired by the `automationsaas` template) to showcase the DCE interface, and clear messaging about empowerment and the \"Citizen Architect\" concept.\n  - **A17 (Showcase Design):** Planning the structure and goals for the Interactive Whitepaper demonstration.\n  - **A18 (Tutorials Design):** Planning the structure for future educational content.\n  - **A19 (Mission Design):** Articulating the strategic vision of fostering \"Citizen Architects\" to ensure technological resilience and innovation.\n\nI have updated the **A0 (Master Artifact List)** to include these new planning documents.\n\nFinally, to begin implementing the vision in A16, I have ported the necessary component (`ContainerScroll`) and configuration from the `automationsaas` template. I updated `tailwind.config.ts` with the required keyframes/animations and modified `src/app/page.tsx` to use the `ContainerScroll` component, replacing the placeholder hero section with the new animated design. This leverages existing context to accelerate development and provides a visually engaging landing page structure.\n\n**Files Updated:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Homepage.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A17-Page-Design-Showcase.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A18-Page-Design-Tutorials.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A19-Page-Design-Mission.md (New)\n  * public/images/logo.png (New Placeholder)\n  * public/images/dce-hero-screenshot.png (New Placeholder)\n  * public/images/workflow-diagram.png (New Placeholder)\n  * src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx (New - Ported)\n  * tailwind.config.ts\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Create A15 (Asset Wishlist):** Generate the new artifact detailing required assets and the public directory structure.\n2.  **Create Placeholder Assets:** Generate placeholder files in `public/images/` to establish the directory structure for the curator.\n3.  **Create A16 (Homepage Design):** Generate the design artifact for the landing page, focusing on the hero section (using `ContainerScroll`) and strategic messaging (\"Citizen Architect\").\n4.  **Create A17 (Showcase Design):** Generate the design artifact for the interactive showcase page.\n5.  **Create A18 (Tutorials Design):** Generate the design artifact for the tutorials/guides section (Phase 2 planning).\n6.  **Create A19 (Mission Design):** Generate the design artifact for the About/Mission page, focusing on the strategic goals.\n7.  **Update A0 (Master Artifact List):** Add the new artifacts (A15-A19) to the master list.\n8.  **Port `ContainerScroll` Component:** Copy `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx` from the `automationsaas` context into the project.\n9.  **Update Tailwind Configuration:** Merge the necessary keyframes and animations from the `automationsaas` `tailwind.config.ts` into the project's `tailwind.config.ts` to support the ported component.\n10. **Implement Homepage Hero (A16):** Update `src/app/page.tsx` to utilize the newly ported `ContainerScroll` component for the hero section, aligning with the design in A16.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15: aiascent.dev - Asset Wishlist\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A prioritized list of required visual assets (images, logos, diagrams) for the aiascent.dev website, including the planned directory structure.\n  - **Tags:** assets, wishlist, images, design, planning, public directory\n\n## 1\\.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nIn Cycle 2, I focused on comprehensive planning and establishing the design foundation for `aiascent.dev`, addressing all the user's requests.\n\nI created **A15 (Asset Wishlist and Aesthetics)** to define the visual direction—a professional, \"Empowered Developer\" look—and catalog the required assets, including the critical DCE screenshot. I also established the necessary `public/images/` directory structure with placeholder files, ready for the curator to drop in the actual assets.\n\nNext, I thoroughly planned the website structure. I created **A16 (Site Map and Navigation)** to define the core routes. Following this, I generated detailed blueprints for each page:\n\n  - **A17 (Home):** Focusing on the value proposition and the main hero visual.\n  - **A18 (Showcase):** Centered around the interactive demonstration.\n  - **A19 (Tutorials):** Planning the educational hub (Phase 2).\n  - **A20 (About/Mission):** Dedicated to the strategic \"Citizen Architect\" vision.\n\nI updated **A0 (Master Artifact List)** to include these new planning documents.\n\nFinally, I updated **A4 (Task Checklist)**. The planning and asset tasks (T-5, T-6) are marked complete. The implementation tasks for the next cycle (T-2) have been refined and expanded to include the creation of the new pages (`/about`, `/tutorials`) and the implementation of the homepage based on the new blueprints.\n\nThe project is now thoroughly documented and ready for the main UI implementation phase.\n\n**Files Updated:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist-and-Aesthetics.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Site-Map-and-Navigation.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A17-Page-Blueprint-Home.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A18-Page-Blueprint-Showcase.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A19-Page-Blueprint-Tutorials.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A20-Page-Blueprint-About-Mission.md\n  * public/images/logo.svg\n  * public/images/dce-in-action.png\n  * public/images/icons/placeholder.txt\n  * public/images/showcase/placeholder.txt\n  * public/favicon.ico\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Create A15 (Asset Wishlist & Aesthetics):** Define the required visual assets for the website and establish the overall design language, ensuring it aligns with the professional nature of the DCE and the empowering theme of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n2.  **Establish Directory Structure:** Create placeholder files within the `public/images/` directory to define the necessary structure for storing assets.\n3.  **Create A16 (Site Map and Navigation Structure):** Outline the overall architecture of the website, defining the pages and how they link together.\n4.  **Create Page Blueprints (A17-A20):** Generate detailed blueprints for each core page (Home, Showcase, Tutorials, About/Mission), detailing their specific content, layout, and functionality.\n5.  **Update A0 (Master Artifact List):** Add the newly created planning artifacts (A15 through A20) to the master list.\n6.  **Update A4 (Universal Task Checklist):** Review the checklist, mark the planning tasks introduced in this cycle as complete (T-5, T-6), and refine the upcoming implementation tasks (T-2, T-3) based on the detailed blueprints generated.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist-and-Aesthetics.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15: aiascent.dev - Asset Wishlist and Design Aesthetics\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Defines the required visual assets, overall design language, and thematic aesthetics for the aiascent.dev website, focusing on a professional, empowering, and modern look.\n  - **Tags:** design, aesthetics, assets, wishlist, branding, ui, ux, citizen architect\n\n## 1\\. Overview & Goal\n\nThis document outlines the visual assets required for the `aiascent.dev` website and defines the guiding principles for its design aesthetics. The goal is to create a visual identity that is professional, modern, and reflective of the sophisticated nature of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), while also subtly conveying the empowering theme of the \"Citizen Architect\" or \"Cognitive Capitalist.\"\n\n## 2\\. Design Aesthetics: The \"Empowered Developer\" Look\n\nThe aesthetic should blend the clean, functional design of modern developer tools with a sense of optimism and empowerment.\n\n  - **Color Palette:** Primarily dark mode focused, using deep blues, charcoals, and blacks for the background. Accent colors should be vibrant but used sparingly for calls to action and highlights (e.g., electric blue, crisp white, perhaps a subtle gold or green highlight).\n  - **Typography:** Clean, highly readable sans-serif fonts. (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or similar modern fonts).\n  - **Visual Style:** Minimalist, with a focus on clarity and hierarchy. Use subtle gradients, soft shadows, and clean lines. Avoid clutter.\n  - **Thematic Tone (Citizen Architect):** The design should feel sophisticated and powerful. We want users to feel like they are accessing a high-end tool that enhances their capabilities. Visual elements might subtly nod to themes of networks, intelligence amplification, and building (architecture).\n\n## 3\\. Asset Wishlist\n\n### 3.1.

I will create a master system prompt artifact, `A15.1`, modeled after the provided example (`A179`), which will define the core aesthetic for all generated assets: a sophisticated, dark, modern, and precise look suitable for a developer tool. Following that, I will generate individual prompt artifacts (`A15.2` through `A15.7`) for each specific asset listed in the wishlist (`A15`), including the logo, icons, and OG image. I will then update the Master Artifact List (`A0`) to include these new documentation artifacts.\n\nNext, I will begin the implementation of the home page (Task T-3 from `A4`). This involves creating four new React components: `HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, and `MissionSection`. I will integrate these into the main `page.tsx` file, replacing the existing placeholder content. The `WorkflowVisualization` component will be the designated location for the `pcp.gif` mentioned in the prompt. I will also draw inspiration from the `automationsaas` context to incorporate dynamic and visually engaging components to elevate the page design.\n\nFinally, I will update the `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to reflect the progress made on these tasks. This approach prioritizes documentation first, then moves to a structured implementation of the code, aligning with the project's established workflow.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create Master Image Prompt (A15.1):** Draft a new artifact `A15.1` to serve as the master system prompt for image generation, adapting the style from `A179` to fit the `aiascent.dev` aesthetic (dark, modern, professional).\n2.  **Create Individual Image Prompts (A15.2-A15.7):** Generate six new artifacts, each containing a specific prompt for the assets listed in `A15` (Logo, Favicon, Context Curation Icon, Parallel Co-pilot Icon, Iterative Workflow Icon, OG Image).\n3.  **Update Master Artifact List (A0):** Modify `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md` to include the newly created image prompt artifacts.\n4.  **Create Home Page Components:** Generate the file shells for the new home page components:\n    *   `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`\n    *   `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`\n    *   `src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx`\n    *   `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`\n5.  **Implement `WorkflowVisualization.tsx`:** Build out this component, specifically ensuring it includes the `pcp.gif` as requested, to visually demonstrate the DCE workflow.\n6.  **Implement `FeaturesSection.tsx`:** Build the features section using the icon placeholders defined in `A15`.\n7.  **Implement `MissionSection.tsx`:** Build the mission section, drawing aesthetic inspiration from components like `LampComponent` in the `automationsaas` context.\n8.  **Implement `HeroSection.tsx`:** Build the hero section, incorporating the primary hero image and leveraging dynamic components like `ContainerScroll` for an engaging user experience.\n9.  **Update Home Page (`page.tsx`):** Reconstruct the main `src/app/page.tsx` to import and arrange the new home page components, replacing the C1 placeholder content.\n10. **Update Task Checklist (A4):** Update `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to mark T-3 as \"In Progress\" and document the work completed in this cycle.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.1: aiascent.dev - Image Generation System Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A master system prompt to guide a multimodal AI in generating a thematically and stylistically coherent set of visual assets for the aiascent.dev website.\n- **Tags:** documentation, image generation, prompt engineering, ai art, branding, design system\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets for the aiascent.dev website. Its goal is to establish a consistent, professional aesthetic that aligns with the project's identity as a sophisticated tool for developers. This prompt should be used as the foundational instruction set for generating the specific assets listed in A15.\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Citizen Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and branding specialist. Your task is to generate a series of clean, professional, and thematically coherent visual assets for a developer-focused website promoting a VS Code extension called the \"Data Curation Environment (DCE)\".\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **sophisticated, modern, and precise**. It should feel like a high-end developer tool.\n    *   **Color Palette:** The primary theme is **dark mode**. Use a deep, near-black background (e.g., `#0A0A0A` or `hsl(0 0% 3.9%)`). Accents should be vibrant and futuristic, primarily using **electric blue, cyan, and a hint of deep purple**. White or light grey should be used for text and fine details to ensure high contrast and readability.\n    *   **Style:** The style should be **clean and minimalist**. For icons, think simple, geometric shapes with clear meanings. For graphics, use sharp lines, subtle gradients, and a sense of depth without being overly complex. Avoid photorealism unless specifically requested.\n\n2.  **Maintain Thematic Cohesion:** The assets must feel like they belong to a single, unified product suite. The core themes are:\n    *   **Precision & Control:** The DCE allows developers to be precise. This can be visualized with grids, fine lines, and focused elements.\n    *   **Workflow & Iteration:** The tool is about process. This can be visualized with circular motifs, arrows, and interconnected nodes.\n    *   **AI Collaboration:** This is a human-AI partnership. This can be visualized by showing human and abstract digital elements interacting.\n\n3.  **Technical Specifications:**\n    *   **Icons (SVG):** Generate as SVG code. Icons should be monochrome or use a maximum of two colors from the palette. They must be clear and legible at small sizes. The style should be line-art or simple filled shapes.\n    *   **Graphics (PNG/WEBP):** For more complex images like the OG:Image, the output should be a high-resolution PNG. The aspect ratio for the OG image must be 1200x630px.\n    *   **Logo (SVG):** The logo must be exceptionally clean and symbolic. It needs to work as a single-color icon and with the full brand palette.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific request for an asset (e.g., \"Generate the icon for 'Context Curation'\"). You will apply these core directives to generate a single, high-quality asset that fits perfectly within the established brand identity.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Asset-Prompt-Logo.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Asset Prompt: Logo\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific generation prompt for the aiascent.dev logo.\n- **Tags:** documentation, image generation, prompt, logo, branding\n\n## 1.

Generation Prompt\n\n**System Prompt:** (Use A15.1 - Image Generation System Prompt)\n\n**User Prompt:**\n\nGenerate the logo for \"aiascent.dev\".\n\nThe logo should be a minimalist, abstract, and geometric mark. It should symbolize the concept of \"ascent\" and AI-driven development.\n\n**Core Idea:** Combine the letter 'A' with an upward-pointing arrow or mountain peak. The 'A' itself should be stylized to look like a schematic or a circuit path.\n\n**Execution:**\n- Use clean, sharp lines.\n- The design must be balanced and symmetrical.\n- The output should be a single SVG file.\n- It must be effective as a single-color mark (e.g., all white on a dark background).\n- Optionally, provide a version where the arrow or a key part of the circuit path uses a subtle gradient of electric blue to cyan.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.3-Asset-Prompt-Favicon.md\">\n# Artifact A15.3: aiascent.dev - Asset Prompt: Favicon\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific generation prompt for the aiascent.dev favicon.\n- **Tags:** documentation, image generation, prompt, favicon, branding\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the Cycle 3 requests and formulated a comprehensive plan. My course of action prioritizes the creation of new documentation artifacts for image generation, followed by a significant implementation phase for the homepage redesign.\n\nFirst, I will generate a complete set of new artifacts (`A15.1` through `A15.7`) to provide detailed image generation prompts for all required assets listed in the Asset Wishlist (A15). This includes a master system prompt modeled after best practices observed in the `aiascentgame` context, ensuring a consistent and high-quality aesthetic. I will also update the Master Artifact List (A0) to properly catalog these new documents.\n\nNext, I will address the homepage implementation (T-3 from A4). I will begin by updating the homepage design document (A16) to incorporate the user's `pcp.gif`, specifying its placement within the workflow visualization section. Following this, I will create four new React components (`HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, `MissionSection`) which will form the new body of the homepage. These components will be built according to the specifications in A16 and will leverage dynamic and visually engaging elements from the `automationsaas` context to create a professional and compelling user experience.\n\nFinally, I will replace the placeholder content in `src/app/page.tsx` with these new components and create placeholder pages for `/learn` and `/mission` to ensure all navigation links in the header are functional. I will also update the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to reflect the progress made on these tasks.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create `A15.1` Master Image Generation System Prompt:** Adapt the structure from `A179.

Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets (logos, icons, etc.) for the `aiascent.dev` website. Its goal is to establish a consistent, professional, and thematically aligned aesthetic that reflects the project's core identity as a sophisticated tool for AI-assisted development. This prompt is modeled on the successful `A179. RDS - Image Generation System Prompt.md`.\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Citizen Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and visual identity consultant specializing in branding for high-end developer tools and enterprise software. Your task is to generate a series of clean, modern, and thematically rich assets for a project called **aiascent.dev**, the home of the \"Data Curation Environment\" (DCE) VS Code extension.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Precision Futurism.\"** This is a clean, dark-themed, and highly professional style. It is not dystopian cyberpunk or sterile sci-fi. It is the aesthetic of a powerful, well-crafted tool.\n    *   **Color Palette:** Primarily dark, sophisticated backgrounds (deep charcoal, near-black). Accents should be vibrant and electric, conveying intelligence and energy. Primary accents are **electric blue (#00BFFF)** and **cyan (#00FFFF)**. Use these for glows, highlights, and key elements.\n    *   **Style:** Vector-based, minimalist, and sharp. Lines should be clean. Gradients should be smooth and subtle. Avoid clutter and unnecessary detail. The feeling should be one of clarity, focus, and power.\n    *   **Lighting:** For icons and logos, lighting should be internal, as if the elements themselves are emitting a soft, controlled glow. This reinforces the \"intelligence\" theme.\n\n2.  **Embrace Thematic Reinforcement:** Every asset must visually communicate one of the core concepts of the DCE:\n    *   **Curation & Precision:** Selecting and organizing complex information.\n    *   **Parallelism & Comparison:** Viewing multiple options or streams of data simultaneously.\n    *   **Iteration & Cycles:** A continuous, refining workflow.\n    *   **Human-AI Collaboration:** A partnership between a human mind and a digital intelligence.\n\n3.  **Maintain Professional Quality & Format:**\n    *   **Format:** All assets should be generated as **SVG**s unless otherwise specified. They must have transparent backgrounds and be infinitely scalable.\n    *   **Clarity:** Icons must be instantly recognizable and clear, even at small sizes. Logos must be legible and impactful.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific request for an asset (e.g., \"an icon for Context Curation\"). You will apply the **\"Precision Futurism\"** aesthetic and the **Thematic Reinforcement** principles to generate a single, high-quality SVG asset that fulfills the request.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Logo (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the main aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, logo, design, assets\n\n## 1. Asset Details\n\n- **Asset ID:** AS-01\n- **Asset Name:** Logo\n- **Format:** SVG\n- **Location:** `public/assets/logo.svg`\n\n## 2. Image Generation Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA minimalist and modern logo for \"aiascent.dev\". The logo should consist of an abstract icon and the logotype \"AIAscent.dev\".\n\n**Icon:**\nThe icon should be an abstract representation of an upward-pointing arrow or a stylized mountain peak, representing \"ascent\". This arrow should be composed of two distinct but intertwined shapes, one solid and one made of clean, parallel lines, symbolizing the partnership between human (solid, foundational) and AI (digital, structured). The entire icon should have a subtle, internal glow of electric blue.\n\n**Logotype:**\nThe text \"AIAscent.dev\" should be in a clean, sans-serif, slightly condensed font (similar to Inter or Monument Extended). The \"AI\" part of the name should be a slightly lighter weight or color than \"Ascent.dev\" to create a subtle distinction.\n\n**Overall:**\nThe logo must be presented on a transparent background, rendered in SVG format. It needs to be clean, professional, and immediately legible, suitable for a high-end developer tool.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.3-Image-Prompt-Favicon.md\">\n# Artifact A15.3: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Favicon (AS-02)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the aiascent.dev favicon (AS-02).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, favicon, design, assets\n\n## 1. Asset Details\n\n- **Asset ID:** AS-02\n- **Asset Name:** Favicon\n- **Format:** ICO/SVG\n- **Location:** `public/assets/favicon.ico`\n\n## 2. Image Generation Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA favicon based on the icon from the `aiascent.dev` logo (AS-01).\n\n**Design:**\nIsolate the abstract, upward-pointing arrow icon from the main logo. The icon should be simplified to ensure maximum clarity at very small sizes (16x16 and 32x32 pixels). It should retain the core concept of two intertwined shapes representing the human-AI partnership.\n\nThe icon should be rendered in a vibrant electric blue, enclosed within a rounded square with a dark charcoal background (#111111). This ensures visibility on both light and dark browser tabs.\n\n**Format:**\nGenerate as a high-resolution SVG on a transparent background, which can then be converted to an ICO file containing multiple sizes.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.4-Image-Prompt-Icon-Context-Curation.md\">\n# Artifact A15.4: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Icon: Context Curation (AS-04)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the \"Context Curation\" icon (AS-04).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, icon, design, assets\n\n## 1.

Image Generation Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA minimalist, vector-style icon representing \"Context Curation\" for the `aiascent.dev` website.\n\n**Design:**\nThe icon should depict a stylized, abstract file tree or a stack of documents on the left. On the right, a glowing cyan checkmark or a magnifying glass is overlaid, symbolizing the act of selection and precision. The overall shape should be contained within a conceptual boundary (like a square or circle) but the lines can be open.\n\nThe lines should be clean and sharp. The primary elements should be a neutral grey or off-white, while the selection element (the checkmark or magnifier) should be a vibrant, glowing cyan to draw focus.\n\n**Format:**\nGenerate as an SVG with a transparent background. The design must be clear and instantly understandable at a small scale.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.5-Image-Prompt-Icon-Parallel-Co-Pilot.md\">\n# Artifact A15.5: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Icon: Parallel Co-Pilot (AS-05)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the \"Parallel Co-Pilot\" icon (AS-05).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, icon, design, assets\n\n## 1. Asset Details\n\n- **Asset ID:** AS-05\n- **Asset Name:** Icon: Parallel Co-Pilot\n- **Format:** SVG\n- **Location:** `public/assets/icons/parallel-copilot.svg`\n\n## 2. Image Generation Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA minimalist, vector-style icon representing \"Parallel Co-Pilot\" for the `aiascent.dev` website.\n\n**Design:**\nThe icon should visually represent the comparison of multiple AI responses. Depict two or three simple, rectangular panels side-by-side. The panels should contain abstract, horizontal lines to represent code or text.\n\nA central, glowing electric blue line or arrow should be positioned between the panels, indicating a process of comparison or selection. The panels themselves should be a neutral grey or off-white. The icon needs to convey the idea of parallel streams of information being analyzed simultaneously.\n\n**Format:**\nGenerate as an SVG with a transparent background. The design must be clear and instantly understandable at a small scale.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.6-Image-Prompt-Icon-Iterative-Workflow.md\">\n# Artifact A15.6: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Icon: Iterative Workflow (AS-06)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the \"Iterative Workflow\" icon (AS-06).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, icon, design, assets\n\n## 1. Asset Details\n\n- **Asset ID:** AS-06\n- **Asset Name:** Icon: Iterative Workflow\n- **Format:** SVG\n- **Location:** `public/assets/icons/iterative-workflow.svg`\n\n## 2. Image Generation Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA minimalist, vector-style icon representing \"Iterative Workflow\" for the `aiascent.dev` website.\n\n**Design:**\nThe icon should symbolize a continuous, cyclical process of refinement.

Purpose and Goal\n\nThe Home page is the primary entry point for all visitors. Its goal is to immediately convey the purpose and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), establishing credibility and motivating developers to explore the tool and the underlying philosophy of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n## 2\\. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  * **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple).\n  * **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  * Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  * Logo on the left, navigation links (Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  * **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component in the `automationsaas` context) to add depth.\n  * **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  * **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  * **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  * **Visual:** The centerpiece will be the `dce-hero-screenshot.png` (A15, AS-03), presented within a stylized container (like the `ContainerScroll` component from AutomationSaaS) to give it a dynamic, engaging feel.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution\n\n  * **Layout:** A two-column or alternating layout highlighting the inefficiencies of standard AI workflows and how DCE solves them.\n  * **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools. Start Building the Future.\"\n  * **Points (Visualized with Icons from A15):**\n      * **Problem:** Manual context management is slow and error-prone. **Solution (Icon AS-04):** DCE provides intuitive, visual context curation directly in VS Code.\n      * **Problem:** Testing AI suggestions is risky and time-consuming. **Solution (Icon AS-05):** The Parallel Co-Pilot enables rapid, side-by-side comparison and safe, Git-integrated testing.\n      * **Problem:** AI collaboration lacks structure and auditability. **Solution (Icon AS-06):** DCE captures the entire development process as an iterative, auditable knowledge graph.\n\n### 4.4. Section 3: The DCE Workflow Visualization (Updated C3)\n\n  * **Layout:** A visually engaging section that clearly demonstrates the DCE in action.\n  * **Headline:** \"See The Workflow in Action.\"\n  * **Visual:** This section will prominently feature the **`pcp.gif`** provided by the curator. The GIF, which shows the entire workflow from opening a workspace to parsing responses, is the most effective way to communicate the tool's function. It should be displayed in a large format, possibly within a stylized, browser-like frame to give it context.\n  * **Content:** Accompanying text will briefly explain what the user is seeing in the GIF: \"The `pcp.gif` demonstrates the core loop of the DCE: curating context, generating a prompt, parsing multiple AI responses in parallel, and accepting the best solution directly into your workspace. This entire cycle happens in minutes, not hours.\"\n\n### 4.5. Section 4: The Mission (Cognitive Capitalism)\n\n  * **Layout:** A more text-focused section with a strong visual anchor (perhaps utilizing the `LampComponent` aesthetic from `automationsaas` for dramatic lighting).\n  * **Headline:** \"More Than Code: The Rise of Cognitive Capitalism.\"\n  * **Content:** A brief, compelling summary of the strategic vision—that mastering AI collaboration is essential for competitiveness and individual empowerment. This section connects the tool (DCE) to the broader mission (combating AI centralization and domination policies).\n  * **CTA:** \"Read Our Mission\" (Links to `/mission`).\n\n### 4.6. Footer\n\n  * Standard site footer (from `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`).\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"public/assets/videos/.gitkeep\">\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C3 - Home Page Implementation\n'use client';\n\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/button\";\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\nimport { ContainerScroll } from \"@/components/global/container-scroll-animation\";\nimport Image from \"next/image\";\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\n  return (\n    <section className=\"h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0c0c0c_100%)]\"></div>\n      <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-100px] md:mt-[-50px]\">\n        <ContainerScroll\n          titleComponent={\n            <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n              <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold mb-8\">\n                Master the Human-AI Workflow.\n                <br />\n                Become a Citizen Architect.\n              </h1>\n              <p className=\"text-neutral-500 text-lg max-w-4xl text-center mb-8\">\n                The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the request for Cycle 3 and formulated a comprehensive plan. My primary focus will be on two main streams of work: first, creating the documentation artifacts for the required image assets, and second, implementing the home page design as outlined in the existing artifacts.\n\nFor the image assets, I will create a master system prompt (`A15.1`) to define the overall aesthetic, modeled after best practices from the `aiascentgame` context. Following that, I will generate individual prompt artifacts for the logo, favicon, feature icons, and the OG image. I will also update the Asset Wishlist (`A15`) to include the `pcp.gif` mentioned in the cycle context and add all these new documents to the Master Artifact List (`A0`).\n\nFor the home page implementation, I will develop the individual sections as separate components (`HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, `MissionSection`) based on the blueprint in `A16`. The `WorkflowVisualization` will be designed to showcase the `pcp.gif`. I will then integrate these components into the main `page.tsx`, replacing the current placeholder content. This will also involve refining the existing `Header` and `Footer` to match the sophisticated, dark aesthetic. Finally, I will update the `A4` task checklist to reflect the work completed and outline the next steps.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create Image Prompt Artifacts (Documentation First):**\n    *   Create `A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md` by adapting the principles from `A179` in the `aiascentgame` context, tailoring it to the `aiascent.dev` project's aesthetic.\n    *   Create `A15.2-Logo-Prompt.md` for the site logo.\n    *   Create `A15.3-Favicon-Prompt.md` for the browser favicon.\n    *   Create `A15.4-Icon-Context-Curation-Prompt.md` for the first feature icon.\n    *   Create `A15.5-Icon-Parallel-Copilot-Prompt.md` for the second feature icon.\n    *   Create `A15.6-Icon-Iterative-Workflow-Prompt.md` for the third feature icon.\n    *   Create `A15.7-OG-Image-Prompt.md` for the social media sharing image.\n2.  **Update Asset & Master Artifact Lists:**\n    *   Update `A15-Asset-Wishlist.md` to include an entry for `pcp.gif` and to reference the new prompt artifacts.\n    *   Update `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md` to catalog all the new `A15.x` artifacts.\n3.  **Implement Home Page Components:**\n    *   Create the directory `src/components/home`.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` based on `A16`, utilizing a dynamic layout.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx` to display the three core features with their icons.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx`, which will be designed to embed and display the `pcp.gif`.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx` as per `A16`.\n4.  **Integrate Home Page and Refine Layout:**\n    *   Update `src/app/page.tsx` to import and render the new home page components in the correct order.\n    *   Refine the styling in `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` and `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` to align with the dark, professional theme described in `A16`.\n5.  **Update Task Checklist:**\n    *   Update `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to mark progress on T-3 and set the stage for the next cycle.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\">\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C3 (Add A15.x image prompt artifacts)\n\n## 1\\.

The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and branding specialist. Your task is to generate a series of clean, modern, and thematically coherent visual assets for a high-end developer tool website, `aiascent.dev`.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Sophisticated Minimalism & Technical Precision.\"** This is a professional tool for expert users.\n    *   **Color Palette:** Primarily a dark theme. Use a near-black or very dark charcoal background (`#111111` or `#1C1C1E`). Accents should be a vibrant, electric blue or cyan (`#00BFFF` or `#00A9E0`) to represent data, energy, and intelligence. Use clean whites and light grays for text and secondary elements.\n    *   **Style:** Minimalist, clean lines, and geometric. Avoid clutter. For icons, think vector-based, line-art style. For more complex images, think high-resolution, professional product photography or abstract digital art.\n    *   **Mood:** Professional, precise, powerful, intelligent, and trustworthy.\n\n2.  **Function Over Form (But Make Form Excellent):** Every asset must be instantly recognizable and clearly communicate its purpose.\n    *   **Icons:** Must be simple, symbolic, and clear even at small sizes. They should look like a cohesive set. Use a consistent line weight.\n    *   **Logos:** Must be strong, memorable, and legible. It should work as a simple monogram or a full wordmark.\n    *   **Images:** Must directly relate to the theme of software development, AI, and data management.\n\n3.  **Technical Specifications:**\n    *   **Format:** Generate assets in a vector-friendly format. Describe them as if you were creating an SVG. For raster images, specify a high resolution (e.g., 4K) and a 16:9 aspect ratio unless otherwise noted.\n    *   **Background:** For icons and logos, always generate on a transparent background unless specified otherwise.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with specific prompts for individual assets. For each one, you will apply these master directives to create a single, high-quality visual that fits perfectly within the `aiascent.dev` brand identity.\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Logo-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Logo Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, logo, design\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nOkay, Cycle 3. I will address all three points from the user's request.\n\nFirst, I will create the full suite of documentation for generating the website's visual assets. This includes a master system prompt modeled on a best-practice example from a previous project, as well as individual prompt artifacts for each required asset outlined in the `A15-Asset-Wishlist`. I will then update the `A0-Master-Artifact-List` to include these new documentation files.\n\nSecond, I will execute task `T-3` from the `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist`, which is the implementation of the home page. I will replace the placeholder content on `src/app/page.tsx` and build out the page structure as defined in `A16-Page-Design-Home`. This involves creating four new section components: `HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, and `MissionSection`.\n\nThird, as part of the home page implementation, I will address the specific request to feature the `pcp.gif`. I will place this animation within the new `WorkflowVisualization` component to clearly demonstrate the DCE's core workflow to visitors.\n\nTo enhance the home page's dynamism and align with the user's appreciation for the `automationsaas` project's aesthetic, I will port over and integrate several of its key animation components, such as `ContainerScroll` for the hero section and `LampComponent` for the mission section.\n\nFinally, I will update the task checklist (`A4`) to mark T-3 as in progress and set up the tasks for the next cycle.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create A15.1:** Generate `A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md`, modeling it after `A179` from the `aiascentgame` context but tailoring the aesthetic to `aiascent.dev`'s sophisticated, dark-mode-first theme.\n2.  **Create A15.2-A15.7:** Generate the six individual prompt artifacts for the logo, favicon, three feature icons, and the Open Graph image as specified in the asset wishlist.\n3.  **Update A0:** Add entries for all seven new `A15.x` artifacts to the `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md`.\n4.  **Port Animation Components:** Recreate the `ContainerScroll`, `Lamp`, and `Sparkles` components from the `automationsaas` context and place them in a new `src/components/landing` directory.\n5.  **Create Home Page Sections:**\n    *   Create `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`, integrating the `ContainerScroll` component to display the `dce-hero-screenshot.png`.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx` to display the three core features with their corresponding icons.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx` and embed the `pcp.gif` within it.\n    *   Create `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`, using the `LampComponent` for a dramatic visual effect.\n6.  **Implement Home Page:** Update `src/app/page.tsx` to clear the placeholder content and assemble the new home page sections in the correct order as defined by `A16`.\n7.  **Refine Header:** Update `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` to improve its styling and alignment with the overall dark, modern aesthetic.\n8.  **Update A4:** Update the status of task T-3 in `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` and prepare for the next cycle's tasks.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.1: aiascent.dev - Image Generation System Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A master system prompt to guide a multimodal AI in generating a thematically and stylistically coherent set of images and icons for the aiascent.dev website.\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt engineering, system prompt, ai art, branding, design\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets for the `aiascent.dev` website. Its goal is to establish a consistent, professional, and thematically appropriate aesthetic that reflects the sophistication of the Data Curation Environment (DCE) tool.\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Digital Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are a world-class graphic designer and branding expert specializing in developer tools and enterprise software. Your task is to generate a series of hyper-clean, professional, and thematically rich visual assets (logos, icons, and marketing images) for a project called **aiascent.dev**, a promotional website for a VS Code extension named the **Data Curation Environment (DCE)**.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Sophisticated, Modern, and Precise.\"** This is a tool for expert developers. The visuals must be clean, clear, and convey a sense of power and precision.\n    *   **Color Palette:** Primarily a dark-mode aesthetic. Use a base of near-black (`#0A0A0A`) or very dark gray. Accents should be a vibrant, electric cyan (`#00FFFF`) and a cool, intelligent blue (`#3B82F6`). White and light grays should be used for contrast and text.\n    *   **Style:** Minimalist, vector-based, and sharp. Avoid photorealism unless specifically requested. Lines should be crisp. Gradients should be subtle and smooth. For icons, think modern iconography like that used by Vercel, Linear, or Stripe.\n    *   **Mood:** Professional, authoritative, and futuristic without being sci-fi fantasy. The feeling should be that of a cutting-edge, indispensable professional tool.\n\n2.  **Embrace Clarity and Recognizability:** Every icon and logo must be instantly recognizable and clearly communicate its purpose.\n    *   **Simplicity is Key:** Icons should be simple enough to be understood at a small size (e.g., 16x16 pixels). Avoid excessive detail.\n    *   **Metaphorical Consistency:** The visual metaphors should be consistent. If a \"file\" is represented in one icon, it should be represented similarly in others.\n\n3.  **Technical Specifications:**\n    *   **Format:** Generate assets as SVGs for scalability, unless a raster format like PNG is explicitly requested.\n    *   **Background:** All logos and icons must be generated on a transparent background. Marketing images should adhere to the specified scene but maintain the core aesthetic.\n    *   **Cleanliness:** Ensure vector assets have clean paths and no unnecessary anchor points.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific prompt for a single asset. You will apply the **Master Aesthetic** and all core directives to generate that asset. Pay close attention to the specific requirements of each prompt to create a cohesive and professional brand identity for aiascent.dev.\n</file_path>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Logo-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Logo Prompt (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, logo, branding\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nOkay, I've analyzed the requests for Cycle 3. My plan is to first create the documentation and assets requested, then begin the implementation of the home page.\n\nFirst, I will create a series of new artifacts for the image generation prompts as requested in A15. This includes a master system prompt (A15.1) modeled on best practices from a similar project, and individual prompts for the logo, icons, and other assets. This \"documentation-first\" approach ensures clarity before any assets are generated. I will also update the home page design document (A16) to incorporate the user's `pcp.gif` into the workflow visualization section.\n\nNext, I will update the master artifact list (A0) to include all the newly created prompt documents.\n\nFinally, I will begin work on Task T-3 from the checklist: implementing the home page. I will create the placeholder components for each major section outlined in the design document (A16)—Hero, Features, Workflow, and Mission. I will then update the main `page.tsx` to render these new components, replacing the temporary content from the initial scaffolding. This sets the stage for fleshing out each component in the subsequent cycle.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `A16-Page-Design-Home.md`:** Modify the \"Workflow Visualization\" section to explicitly mention the use of the `pcp.gif` provided by the curator.\n2.  **Create `A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md`:** Generate a new master system prompt artifact, modeling its structure and tone on `A179. RDS - Image Generation System Prompt.md` but tailoring the aesthetic to `aiascent.dev`.\n3.  **Create `A15.2` through `A15.7`:** Generate six new artifacts containing specific image generation prompts for the logo, favicon, feature icons, and OG image as outlined in the asset wishlist.\n4.  **Update `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md`:** Add entries for all the new `A15.x` artifacts to maintain a complete and organized list of project documentation.\n5.  **Create Home Page Component Shells:** Generate the initial files for the home page sections: `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`, `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`, `src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx`, and `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`. These will be placeholders to establish the structure.\n6.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** Replace the existing placeholder content with the new home page section components.\n7.  **Update `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`:** Mark the initial setup of the home page components as in-progress under task T-3 and prepare the checklist for the next cycle's work.\n8.  **Add Curator Activity:** Include a section to instruct the curator on where to place the `pcp.gif` file.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nPlease place the `pcp.gif` file you mentioned into the `public/assets/images/` directory.

Purpose and Goal\n\nThe Home page is the primary entry point for all visitors. Its goal is to immediately convey the purpose and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), establishing credibility and motivating developers to explore the tool and the underlying philosophy of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n## 2\\. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  * **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple).\n  * **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  * Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  * Logo on the left, navigation links (Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  * **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component in the `automationsaas` context) to add depth.\n  * **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  * **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  * **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  * **Visual:** The centerpiece will be the `dce-hero-screenshot.png` (A15, AS-03), presented within a stylized container (like the `ContainerScroll` component from AutomationSaaS) to give it a dynamic, engaging feel.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution\n\n  * **Layout:** A two-column or alternating layout highlighting the inefficiencies of standard AI workflows and how DCE solves them.\n  * **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools. Start Building the Future.\"\n  * **Points (Visualized with Icons from A15):**\n      * **Problem:** Manual context management is slow and error-prone. **Solution (Icon AS-04):** DCE provides intuitive, visual context curation directly in VS Code.\n      * **Problem:** Testing AI suggestions is risky and time-consuming. **Solution (Icon AS-05):** The Parallel Co-Pilot enables rapid, side-by-side comparison and safe, Git-integrated testing.\n      * **Problem:** AI collaboration lacks structure and auditability. **Solution (Icon AS-06):** DCE captures the entire development process as an iterative, auditable knowledge graph.\n\n### 4.4. Section 3: The DCE Workflow Visualization (Interactive Element)\n\n  * **Layout:** A visually engaging section centered around a clear demonstration of the product in action.\n  * **Headline:** \"The Power of Iteration: See the DCE Workflow\"\n  * **Visual:** This section will prominently feature the `pcp.gif` provided by the curator. The GIF runs through a complete project workflow, from opening a workspace to onboarding and processing multiple AI responses, clearly demonstrating how the DCE operates. The surrounding text will provide context for each stage shown in the animation.\n  * **Curator Note:** The `pcp.gif` should be placed in `public/assets/images/`.\n\n### 4.5.

Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets (logos, icons, etc.) for the `aiascent.dev` website. Its goal is to establish a consistent aesthetic and thematic direction for the image generation AI, ensuring all visuals align with the project's brand identity as a sophisticated, modern developer tool.\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Digital Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and brand identity specialist with a deep understanding of iconography for developer tools and high-tech software. Your task is to generate a series of clean, modern, and thematically rich vector-style graphics for the `aiascent.dev` website, a promotional site for a powerful VS Code extension.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Sophisticated & Futuristic Minimalism.\"**\n    *   **Style:** Clean lines, geometric shapes, and a minimalist approach are paramount. Avoid clutter, excessive detail, and photorealism. The output should be suitable for SVG format.\n    *   **Color Palette:** The primary palette is monochrome (shades of dark gray, black, and white) accented with a vibrant, glowing **electric blue or cyan**. Gradients should be smooth and used purposefully to suggest energy or digital light.\n    *   **Feeling:** The assets should feel precise, professional, innovative, and authoritative. They belong to a cutting-edge tool for serious developers.\n\n2.  **Embrace Clarity and Recognizability:** Every icon and logo must have a dual purpose.\n    *   **Purpose 1: Be Instantly Recognizable.** The design must be simple and clear enough to be understood at small sizes (e.g., as a favicon or in a feature list).\n    *   **Purpose 2: Convey the Concept.** The visual metaphor must directly relate to the feature or idea it represents (e.g., \"Context Curation\" should visually suggest file management or selection).\n\n3.  **Maintain Vector-Ready Quality:**\n    *   **Format:** Generate images that look like clean vector graphics. Use solid colors, simple gradients, and sharp edges. Do not produce rasterized, painterly, or complex photographic styles. The final assets will be used as SVGs on the website.\n    *   **Background:** Unless specified otherwise, generate all icons and logos on a transparent or solid dark background to fit the website's dark-mode-first theme.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific `<Image Prompt>` for each asset required. For each prompt, you will apply these core directives to generate a single, powerful, and on-brand graphic.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Logo-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Logo Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the main aiascent.dev logo.\n- **Tags:** assets, prompt engineering, ai art, logo design\n\n## 1.

My primary focus will be on generating the necessary image prompt artifacts and beginning the implementation of the home page as specified in the updated task list and design documents.\n\nFirst, I will create a master system prompt for image generation (`A15.1`) modeled on best practices. Following that, I will generate individual prompt artifacts for each required asset in the wishlist (`A15.2` through `A15.7`), covering the logo, icons, and social media image. I will then update the Master Artifact List (`A0`) to include these new documents.\n\nNext, I will address the user's request to feature the `pcp.gif` by updating the Home Page Design document (`A16`) to explicitly incorporate it into the workflow visualization section.\n\nFinally, I will begin implementing the home page itself (Task T-3). This involves creating four new React components for the various sections (Hero, Features, Workflow Visualization, and Mission) and integrating them into the main `page.tsx`. The workflow visualization component will be specifically designed to display the `pcp.gif`.

Use a deep, near-black charcoal or dark navy as the base. Accents should be vibrant and electric, primarily **cyan** (`#00FFFF`), **electric blue**, and hints of **deep purple**. White should be used for high-contrast text and elements.\n    *   **Style:** Clean, vector-based graphics for icons and logos. For more complex images, aim for a hyper-realistic or photorealistic style that feels grounded and professional. Avoid cartoonish or overly abstract styles.\n    *   **Mood:** The mood is authoritative, intelligent, and powerful. The visuals should convey precision, efficiency, and the transformative potential of the DCE tool.\n\n2.  **Maintain Cohesion and Clarity:**\n    *   **Icons:** Icons must be instantly recognizable and communicate a single concept clearly. They should be designed as a cohesive set, sharing the same line weight, color palette, and visual language. They should be delivered as SVGs on a transparent background.\n    *   **Logos:** The logo should be simple, memorable, and scalable. It must work well in both monochrome and color, and on both light and dark backgrounds.\n    *   **Imagery:** More complex images (like the OG image) should feel like professional product shots or well-composed digital art. They must adhere to the core color palette and mood.\n\n3.  **Technical Specifications:**\n    *   **Format:** Unless specified otherwise, generate assets in a format suitable for web use (SVG for vectors, PNG/WEBP for raster images).\n    *   **Background:** All icons and logos must be generated on a transparent background.\n    *   **Aspect Ratio:** Pay close attention to specified aspect ratios, especially for social media images (e.g., 1.91:1 for OG images).\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with specific, individual prompts for each asset required. For each prompt, you will apply this Master System Prompt to ensure the final output is stylistically and thematically aligned with the `aiascent.dev` brand identity.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Logo-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Logo Prompt (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n- **Tags:** image prompt, logo, branding, asset\n\n## 1.

My course of action is to first create the documentation for the requested image prompts and then proceed with the implementation of the new home page design.\n\nFor the image prompts, I will create a master system prompt artifact (A15.1) to define the website's visual aesthetic, drawing inspiration from the `aiascentgame` context. Following that, I will generate individual artifacts (A15.2-A15.7) containing specific prompts for the logo, icons, and other required assets as listed in the Asset Wishlist (A15).\n\nFor the home page implementation, I will create four new components (`HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, `MissionSection`) as specified in the Home Page Design artifact (A16). The `WorkflowVisualization` component will be designed to showcase the user-provided `pcp.gif`, fulfilling that part of the request. I will then integrate these components into the main `page.tsx` file, replacing the existing placeholder content.

The `WorkflowVisualization.tsx` will include an `<img>` tag with `src=\"/assets/images/pcp.gif\"` to display the user's animation.\n6.  **Integrate Homepage Sections:** Update `src/app/page.tsx` to import and render the new home page section components, replacing the current placeholder content.\n7.  **Update Task Checklist (A4):** Modify `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to reflect the completion of the image prompt generation and the initial implementation of the home page (T-3).\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.1: aiascent.dev - Image Generation System Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A comprehensive system prompt to guide a multimodal AI in generating a thematically and stylistically coherent set of images, icons, and logos for the aiascent.dev website.\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt engineering, ai art, design, branding, dce\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets for the `aiascent.dev` website. Its goal is to establish a consistent, professional, and thematically resonant aesthetic that reflects the sophisticated and powerful nature of the Data Curation Environment (DCE). This prompt is modeled on the successful `A179` from the `aiascent.game` project.\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Citizen Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and branding specialist with a deep understanding of user interface design, developer tools, and corporate identity. Your task is to generate a series of hyper-clean, professional, and thematically rich assets (logos, icons, and images) for a promotional website for a VS Code extension called the \"Data Curation Environment\" (DCE).\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Sophisticated Developer Tool.\"** Think clean, precise, and modern. The visual language should evoke concepts of structure, clarity, and power.\n    *   **Color Palette:** Primarily a dark, near-black background (`#0A0A0A`). Accents should be a vibrant, electric blue (`#00A8FF`) or cyan (`#00E0FF`) to represent data flow and intelligence. White (`#FFFFFF`) should be used for text and primary iconographic elements for high contrast and readability.\n    *   **Style:** Vector-based, flat design for icons and logos. For more complex images (like hero or OG images), the style should be photorealistic or a highly polished 3D render, maintaining the same color palette and clean aesthetic. Avoid clutter and unnecessary ornamentation.\n\n2.  **Embrace Thematic Resonance:** Every asset must visually communicate one of the core concepts of the DCE:\n    *   **Curation & Precision:** Selecting and organizing data with intent. Visual metaphors include grids, layers, focused nodes, and structured pathways.\n    *   **Parallelism & Comparison:** Viewing multiple options simultaneously. Visual metaphors include side-by-side panels, branching paths, and split views.\n    *   **Iteration & Workflow:** A continuous, structured cycle of development. Visual metaphors include circular arrows, gears, and looped diagrams.\n    *   **Human-AI Collaboration:** A partnership between human intellect and artificial intelligence. Visual metaphors include interlocking shapes, shared interfaces, or a human hand interacting with a digital construct.\n\n3.  **Maintain Professional Quality & Format:**\n    *   **Logos & Icons:** Must be generated as clean SVGs on a transparent background. They should be simple, instantly recognizable, and effective at small sizes.\n    *   **Images:** Should be high-resolution (e.g., 4K) with a 16:9 aspect ratio for hero images and a 1200x630px aspect ratio for OG images. Composition should be clean, well-balanced, and focused.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific, single-purpose prompt for each asset I need. You will apply these master directives (Aesthetic, Theme, and Quality) to that specific prompt to generate a single, high-quality asset that fits perfectly within the `aiascent.dev` brand identity.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt: Logo\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific AI image generation prompt for the main logo of the aiascent.dev website.\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, logo, branding\n\n## 1. Asset ID\nAS-01: Logo\n\n## 2. Location\n`public/assets/logo.svg`\n\n## 3. Generation Prompt\n\n**Image Style:** Flat vector logo, SVG format, transparent background.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\"Create a modern, minimalist logo for a software company called 'AIAscent'. The logo should be composed of two parts: an icon and the text 'AIAscent.dev'. The icon should cleverly combine the letters 'A' and 'A' into a single, abstract shape that resembles an upward-pointing arrow or a mountain peak, symbolizing 'ascent'. The design must be clean, geometric, and precise. Use a single, vibrant electric blue color (#00A8FF) for the icon.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the user's request for Cycle 3 and formulated a comprehensive plan. My primary objectives are to generate a series of image prompt artifacts, update the homepage design document to include a new asset, and then implement the new homepage design by creating several new React components and integrating them.\n\nFirst, I will create a master system prompt for image generation (A15.1) that establishes a dark, sophisticated, developer-focused aesthetic for the `aiascent.dev` brand. Following that, I will generate individual prompt artifacts for each required asset listed in A15, including the logo, favicon, feature icons, and social media image. I will also update the master artifact list (A0) to catalog these new documents.\n\nNext, I will update the homepage design document (A16) to explicitly incorporate the `pcp.gif` provided by the curator. This GIF will serve as the central visual for the workflow visualization section.\n\nFinally, I will proceed with the implementation of the homepage itself (Task T-3). This involves creating four new components: `HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, and `MissionSection`. I will leverage components and aesthetic styles from the `automationsaas` context, such as `ContainerScroll` and `LampComponent`, to create a dynamic and visually engaging experience. This will require porting those components into the current project. I will then integrate these new components into the main `page.tsx` file, replacing the existing placeholder content. I will conclude by updating the universal task checklist (A4) to reflect the progress made.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create A15.1:** Generate the `A15.1 aiascent.dev - Master Image Generation System Prompt.md` artifact, modeling it after `A179` from the `aiascentgame` context but tailoring the aesthetic to be dark, modern, and developer-focused with specific color accents.\n2.  **Create A15.x Image Prompts:** Generate the individual image prompt artifacts (`A15.2` through `A15.7`) for the logo, favicon, three feature icons, and the Open Graph image, as specified in the `A15-Asset-Wishlist.md`.\n3.  **Update A0:** Update the `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md` to include all the newly created `A15.x` artifacts under a new \"Design and Assets\" sub-category.\n4.  **Update A16:** Modify `A16-Page-Design-Home.md` to explicitly state that the \"Workflow Visualization\" section will feature the `pcp.gif` located at `public/assets/videos/pcp.gif`.\n5.  **Port `automationsaas` Components:** Create `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`, `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`, and `src/components/global/sparkles.tsx` by porting the code from the `automationsaas` flattened repo context.\n6.  **Create Home Page Components:** Create the new files for the homepage sections: `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`, `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`, `src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx`, and `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`.\n7.  **Implement Home Page Components:** Populate the newly created components with JSX and logic according to the design in `A16`, utilizing the ported `automationsaas` components and referencing the asset paths from `A15`.\n8.  **Update `page.tsx`:** Modify the root `src/app/page.tsx` to import and render the new home page section components, replacing the C1 placeholder content.\n9.  **Update A4:** Update `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to mark task T-3 as \"In Progress\" and describe the implementation work completed in this cycle.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md\">\n# Artifact A15.1: aiascent.dev - Master Image Generation System Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A master system prompt to guide a multimodal AI in generating a thematically and stylistically coherent set of images, icons, and logos for the aiascent.dev website.\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt engineering, design system, branding, dce, aiascent.dev\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets for the `aiascent.dev` website. Its goal is to establish a consistent, professional, and thematically resonant aesthetic that reflects the sophistication and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Citizen Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and brand strategist specializing in developer tools and high-tech software. Your task is to generate a series of hyper-clean, professional, and thematically rich assets (logos, icons, and images) for a promotional website for a VS Code extension called the \"Data Curation Environment\" (DCE).\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Sophisticated Developer Precision.\"** This is a dark-mode-first design language that is clean, minimalist, and authoritative.\n    *   **Color Palette:** The primary background is a very dark gray or near-black (`#111827` or similar). The primary accent color is a vibrant, electric cyan/blue (`#22d3ee`). A secondary accent of a deep purple (`#8b5cf6`) can be used for contrast. Text and secondary elements are typically off-white or light gray.\n    *   **Style:** Minimalist and geometric. Lines are clean and sharp. Avoid clutter, noise, and overly complex textures. The feeling should be one of precision, control, and power.\n    *   **Lighting:** For images, lighting should be dramatic and cinematic, as if in a high-end tech commercial. Think soft ambient light with sharp, focused highlights on key elements. For icons and logos, lighting is generally flat and graphical, but subtle gradients can be used.\n\n2.  **Fulfill the Asset's Purpose:** Every asset you create has a specific job.\n    *   **Logos & Icons:** These must be instantly recognizable and symbolic. They should be simple enough to work at small sizes (like a favicon) but distinctive enough to be memorable. They must be generated as SVGs or high-resolution PNGs with transparent backgrounds.\n    *   **Illustrations & Images:** These assets tell a story. They must not only depict the subject of the prompt but also reinforce the core themes of the DCE: precision, control, efficiency, and the power of human-AI collaboration.\n\n3.  **Maintain Technical Excellence:**\n    *   **Vector-First (for Logos/Icons):** When creating logos and icons, think in terms of vectors. The output should be clean enough to be easily traced into an SVG.\n    *   **High Resolution:** All assets should be generated at a high resolution suitable for modern high-DPI displays.\n    *   **Consistency:** All generated assets must look like they belong to the same brand family. Use the color palette and minimalist style consistently across all outputs.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific prompt for a single asset (e.g., \"Create a logo,\" \"Generate an icon for 'Context Curation'\"). You will apply the **\"Sophisticated Developer Precision\"** aesthetic and the above directives to generate a single, high-quality asset that perfectly fits the `aiascent.dev` brand.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Logo (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the main aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt engineering, logo, branding, aiascent.dev\n\n## 1.

Image Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nCreate a modern, minimalist logo for \"aiascent.dev\".\n\nThe logo should be abstract and geometric, conveying concepts of ascension, data, and architecture. It could be an stylized 'A' that also looks like an upward-pointing arrow or a mountain peak.\n\nThe design must be clean, sharp, and professional, suitable for a high-tech developer tool.\n\nUse the primary color palette: a vibrant electric cyan/blue (`#22d3ee`) as the main color, with a dark background (`#111827`).\n\nThe output should be a vector-style graphic on a transparent background.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.3-Image-Prompt-Favicon.md\">\n# Artifact A15.3: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt for Favicon (AS-02)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the aiascent.dev favicon (AS-02).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt engineering, icon, favicon, branding, aiascent.dev\n\n## 1.

Image Prompt\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nGenerate a favicon based on the aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n\nTake the abstract, geometric 'A' / arrow symbol from the main logo and simplify it for a very small scale (16x16, 32x32). The icon must be instantly recognizable.\n\nThe icon should be a single, solid shape in the brand's vibrant electric cyan/blue (`#22d3ee`).\n\nThe output must be a high-resolution PNG with a transparent background.

Purpose and Goal\n\nThe Home page is the primary entry point for all visitors. Its goal is to immediately convey the purpose and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), establishing credibility and motivating developers to explore the tool and the underlying philosophy of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n## 2\\. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  * **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple).\n  * **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  * Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  * Logo on the left, navigation links (Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  * **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component in the `automationsaas` context) to add depth.\n  * **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  * **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  * **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  * **Visual:** The centerpiece will be the `dce-hero-screenshot.png` (A15, AS-03), presented within a stylized container (like the `ContainerScroll` component from AutomationSaaS) to give it a dynamic, engaging feel.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution\n\n  * **Layout:** A two-column or alternating layout highlighting the inefficiencies of standard AI workflows and how DCE solves them.\n  * **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools. Start Building the Future.\"\n  * **Points (Visualized with Icons from A15):**\n      * **Problem:** Manual context management is slow and error-prone. **Solution (Icon AS-04):** DCE provides intuitive, visual context curation directly in VS Code.\n      * **Problem:** Testing AI suggestions is risky and time-consuming. **Solution (Icon AS-05):** The Parallel Co-Pilot enables rapid, side-by-side comparison and safe, Git-integrated testing.\n      * **Problem:** AI collaboration lacks structure and auditability. **Solution (Icon AS-06):** DCE captures the entire development process as an iterative, auditable knowledge graph.\n\n### 4.4. Section 3: The DCE Workflow Visualization (Interactive Element)\n\n  * **Layout:** A visually engaging section dedicated to showing the DCE in action.\n  * **Headline:** \"The Power of Iteration: See the DCE Workflow\"\n  * **Visual:** This section will prominently feature the `pcp.gif` provided by the curator. The GIF, which demonstrates the full workflow from opening a workspace to parsing multiple AI responses, will be the central focus. It should be displayed in a high-quality format, possibly within a stylized container that resembles a monitor or a VS Code window.\n  * **Asset Path:** `public/assets/videos/pcp.gif` (Curator to provide and place file here).\n\n### 4.5. Section 4: The Mission (Cognitive Capitalism)\n\n  * **Layout:** A more text-focused section with a strong visual anchor (perhaps utilizing the `LampComponent` aesthetic from `automationsaas` for dramatic lighting).\n  * **Headline:** \"More Than Code: The Rise of Cognitive Capitalism.\"\n  * **Content:** A brief, compelling summary of the strategic vision—that mastering AI collaboration is essential for competitiveness and individual empowerment. This section connects the tool (DCE) to the broader mission (combating AI centralization and domination policies).\n  * **CTA:** \"Read Our Mission\" (Links to `/mission`).\n\n### 4.6. Footer\n\n  * Standard site footer (from `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`).\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx\">\n'use client'\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react'\nimport { useScroll, useTransform, motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nexport const ContainerScroll = ({\n  titleComponent,\n  children,\n}: {\n  titleComponent: string | React.ReactNode\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) => {\n  const containerRef = useRef<any>(null)\n  const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({\n    target: containerRef,\n  })\n  const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = React.useState(false)\n\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    const checkMobile = () => {\n      setIsMobile(window.innerWidth <= 768)\n    }\n    checkMobile()\n    window.addEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\n    return () => {\n      window.removeEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\n    }\n  }, [])\n\n  const scaleDimensions = () => {\n    return isMobile ?

          "content": "<summary>\nOkay, I'm ready for Cycle 3. My course of action is to tackle the three main requests: implementing the new home page design, creating a suite of artifacts for image generation prompts, and updating the home page design to incorporate the provided `pcp.gif`.\n\nFirst, I will create a master system prompt for image generation (A15.1), modeled after the successful `A179` from the `aiascentgame` context, to establish a consistent aesthetic. Following that, I will generate individual prompt artifacts for each required asset listed in the wishlist (A15), from the logo and favicon to the specific icons for the features section. I will also update the Master Artifact List (A0) to catalog these new documents.\n\nNext, I will update the Home Page Design artifact (A16) to explicitly include the `pcp.gif` in the \"Workflow Visualization\" section, ensuring the documentation reflects the plan before implementation.\n\nFinally, I will execute the home page implementation (T-3 from A4). This involves porting over several complex UI components from the `automationsaas` project (`ContainerScroll`, `Sparkles`, and `Lamp`) and creating the new section components (`HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, `MissionSection`). I will then integrate these into the main `page.tsx` to bring the new design to life, replacing the placeholder content from Cycle 1.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create Image Generation System Prompt (A15.1):** Adapt the `A179` artifact from the `aiascentgame` context to create a new master system prompt (`A15.1`) for generating all visual assets for `aiascent.dev`.\n2.  **Create Individual Image Prompts (A15.2-A15.7):** Generate a new artifact for each required asset in A15, containing the specific text prompt for the image generation AI. This includes the logo, favicon, feature icons, and OG image.\n3.  **Update Master Artifact List (A0):** Add the newly created A15.x artifacts to `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md` to keep the project documentation synchronized.\n4.  **Update Home Page Design (A16):** Modify `A16-Page-Design-Home.md` to incorporate the user's `pcp.gif` into the \"Workflow Visualization\" section, ensuring the design document accurately reflects this new requirement.\n5.  **Port UI Components from AutomationSaaS:** Recreate the `ContainerScroll`, `Sparkles`, and `Lamp` components from the `automationsaas` context as new files within the `aiascent.dev` project to be used on the home page.\n6.  **Implement Home Page Sections:** Create the new React components for each section of the home page as defined in the updated A16: `HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowVisualization`, and `MissionSection`.\n7.  **Integrate Home Page:** Update `src/app/page.tsx` to import and render the new home page section components, replacing the current placeholder content.\n8.  **Update Task Checklist (A4):** Mark sub-tasks of T-3 as in-progress or complete in `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\">\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C3 (Add image generation prompt artifacts A15.1-A15.7)\n\n## 1\\.

Purpose\n\nThis document provides a master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets for the `aiascent.dev` website. Its goal is to establish a consistent aesthetic and thematic direction for the image generation AI, ensuring that all logos, icons, and images contribute to the project's professional and sophisticated brand identity. This artifact is modeled on the successful `A179. RDS - Image Generation System Prompt.md` from the `aiascent.game` project.\n\n## 2. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Digital Architect's Toolkit**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and branding specialist with a deep understanding of user interface design, iconography, and developer tool aesthetics. Your task is to generate a series of clean, professional, and thematically coherent visual assets for **aiascent.dev**, the promotional website for a VS Code extension called the **Data Curation Environment (DCE)**.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** Your guiding aesthetic is **\"Sophisticated, Modern, and Precise.\"** This reflects the nature of a high-end developer tool.\n    *   **Color Palette:** The primary theme is dark mode. Use a base of near-black or very dark charcoal (`#111827`). The primary accent color is a vibrant, electric blue or cyan (`#22d3ee`), used to convey intelligence, clarity, and energy. Secondary accents can include a cool-toned purple (`#8b5cf6`) or a clean white/light gray for text and highlights.\n    *   **Style:** The style should be clean, minimalist, and often abstract or symbolic. For icons, think vector-based, flat, or subtly 2.5D designs. Avoid overly complex or realistic imagery unless specifically requested. The overall feeling should be professional, trustworthy, and futuristic.\n    *   **Lighting & Effects:** Use subtle gradients, soft glows, and sharp lines to create a sense of digital precision and depth. Avoid anything that looks cartoonish or hand-drawn.\n\n2.  **Embrace the Core Metaphor:** The DCE is a tool for **\"Citizen Architects\"**—developers who build complex systems with AI. Your visuals should evoke themes of:\n    *   **Structure & Architecture:** Grids, blueprints, interconnected nodes, layers.\n    *   **Clarity & Focus:** Magnifying glasses, lenses, highlighted text or code, clean interfaces.\n    *   **Workflow & Iteration:** Circular arrows, branching paths, gears, process diagrams.\n    *   **Human-AI Collaboration:** Abstract representations of a human mind and a digital network intertwining.\n\n3.  **Prioritize Clarity and Scalability:**\n    *   **Icons:** Must be instantly recognizable and legible at small sizes. They should be designed as SVGs with clean lines and a limited color palette. They must work on a dark background.\n    *   **Logos:** Must be simple, memorable, and scalable. The design should encapsulate the core concept of the brand.\n    *   **Images:** Should be high-resolution and composed with clear focal points.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific request for a visual asset (e.g., \"an icon for 'Context Curation'\"). You will apply the **Master Aesthetic** and the **Core Metaphor** to generate a single, high-quality asset that perfectly fits the `aiascent.dev` brand identity. You will focus on fulfilling the specific prompt while ensuring it aligns with the overall design system established here.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Prompt-Logo.md\">\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Prompt: Logo\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** The specific image generation prompt for the aiascent.dev logo (AS-01).\n- **Tags:** image generation, prompt, logo, asset\n\n## 1.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis cycle (C3) focuses on two main areas: establishing a robust system for generating visual assets and beginning the implementation of the homepage (T-3), leveraging dynamic components from the `automationsaas` template.\n\n**1. Image Generation System:**\nI have created the foundational artifacts for image generation. This includes `A15.1` (Master System Prompt), which defines the aesthetic direction (Sophisticated, Futuristic, Solarpunk-inspired) and guidelines for the image generation AI. I then created individual prompt artifacts (A15.2-A15.6) for the logo, favicon, and the three core feature icons. A15 (Asset Wishlist) has been updated to link to these prompts and to include the new `pcp.gif` asset provided by the curator. A0 (Master Artifact List) has been updated to include these new artifacts.\n\n**2. Homepage Design Update:**\nI updated A16 (Page Design: Home) to incorporate the `pcp.gif`. The most impactful place for this GIF is the Hero section, replacing the static screenshot. This immediately demonstrates the dynamic nature of the DCE.\n\n**3. Homepage Implementation (T-3):**\nI began the implementation of the homepage as outlined in A4, Task T-3.\n\n  * **Ported Dynamic Components:** I ported the `ContainerScroll`, `LampComponent`, and `3d-card` components from the `automationsaas` context into `src/components/global`. These will be used to create the visually engaging sections defined in A16.\n  * **Created Section Components:** I created the foundational structure for the main homepage sections: `HeroSection.tsx`, `FeaturesSection.tsx`, and `MissionSection.tsx`.\n  * **Implementation:**\n      * `HeroSection` utilizes the `ContainerScroll` component to display the main visual (currently using the static screenshot as a placeholder until the GIF is placed by the curator) and the primary CTAs.\n      * `FeaturesSection` implements the three-column layout highlighting the core benefits of the DCE, using the placeholder icons.\n      * `MissionSection` utilizes the `LampComponent` for a dramatic visual presentation of the strategic vision.\n  * **Integration:** These sections have been integrated into `src/app/page.tsx`, replacing the placeholder content from C1.\n  * **Layout Refinements:** The `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` have been updated with refined styling and navigation links corresponding to the planned pages (A16-A19).\n\nFinally, I updated the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to reflect the progress on T-3.\n\n**Files Updated/Created:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.1-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.2-Prompt-Logo.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.3-Prompt-Favicon.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.4-Prompt-Icon-Context-Curation.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.5-Prompt-Icon-Parallel-Copilot.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.6-Prompt-Icon-Iterative-Workflow.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/3d-card.tsx (New - Ported)\n  * src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx (New - Ported)\n  * src/components/global/lamp.tsx (New - Ported)\n  * src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Create A15.1 (Master System Prompt):** Define the aesthetic guidelines based on A16 and the structure of A179 (from `aiascentgame` context).\n2.  **Update A15 (Asset Wishlist):** Add the `pcp.gif` asset and link existing assets to their new prompt artifacts.\n3.  **Create A15.X Artifacts:** Generate individual prompt artifacts (A15.2-A15.6) for the logo, favicon, and icons.\n4.  **Update A0 (Master Artifact List):** Register the new A15.X artifacts.\n5.  **Update A16 (Page Design: Home):** Modify the Hero section (4.2) to utilize the `pcp.gif` instead of the static screenshot for maximum impact.\n6.  **Port Dynamic Components:** Copy `ContainerScroll`, `LampComponent`, and `3d-card` from `automationsaas` context (M7) to `src/components/global`.\n7.  **Create Homepage Section Components:** Create `HeroSection.tsx`, `FeaturesSection.tsx`, and `MissionSection.tsx` in `src/components/home`.\n8.  **Implement HeroSection:** Utilize `ContainerScroll` and the main visual (placeholder for GIF/screenshot).\n9.  **Implement FeaturesSection:** Implement the three-column layout with icons.\n10. **Implement MissionSection:** Utilize `LampComponent`.\n11. **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** Integrate the new section components.\n12. **Update Layout Components:** Refine `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` styling and navigation links.\n13. **Update A4 (Task Checklist):** Mark T-3 as \"In Progress\" and update sub-tasks.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\n\n1.  **Place GIF Asset:** Please place the `pcp.gif` file into the `public/assets/images/` directory.

Purpose\n\nThis document provides the master system prompt for generating all visual assets for aiascent.dev. Its goal is to establish a consistent aesthetic that reflects the sophistication, precision, and visionary nature of the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. The Master System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The AIAscent Aesthetic**\n\nYou are an expert digital artist and UI/UX designer tasked with creating visual assets for **aiascent.dev**, the promotional website for a sophisticated developer tool called the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** The aesthetic is **Modern, Professional, Futuristic, and Precise**. The website uses a dark-mode-first design philosophy.\n\n      * **Color Palette:** Dominated by dark backgrounds (deep navy, charcoal, or black) with vibrant, futuristic accents. Primary accents should be electric blue, cyan, and deep purple. Use white or light gray for contrast and text.\n      * **Style:** Clean, minimalist, and high-tech. Think of the interfaces seen in advanced engineering software or sophisticated visualization tools. Use sharp lines, subtle gradients, and occasional holographic or glowing effects to suggest advanced technology.\n      * **Inspiration:** Draw inspiration from the clean lines of modern developer tools (like VS Code or Linear) combined with the optimistic, technologically advanced aspects of **Solarpunk** design (clean energy, integration, empowerment).\n\n2.  **Asset Type Specific Guidelines:**\n\n      * **Icons (SVG):**\n\n          * Icons must be simple, recognizable, and scalable.\n          * Use a consistent line weight.\n          * They should primarily use the accent colors (blue, cyan, purple) against the dark background.\n          * Avoid excessive detail; focus on clear communication of the concept.\n\n      * **Logos & Wordmarks (SVG):**\n\n          * The logo should be sleek and professional.\n          * It must work well in both full color and monochrome (e.g., solid white).\n          * The design should evoke themes of ascent, precision, data, or architecture.\n\n      * **Illustrations/Images (PNG/WEBP):**\n\n          * Images should be cinematic and visually rich, adhering to the color palette.\n          * They should convey the power and impact of the DCE tool.\n          * Use realistic lighting, even when depicting futuristic concepts.\n\n3.  **Thematic Consistency:** Ensure all assets feel like they belong to the same ecosystem. The visuals should reinforce the core message of the DCE: empowering developers (\"Citizen Architects\") to master the human-AI workflow.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with specific prompts for individual assets. For each prompt, you will apply this Master Aesthetic and the relevant Asset Type Specific Guidelines to generate the visual asset.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15: aiascent.dev - Asset Wishlist and Directory Structure\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C3 (Link prompt artifacts A15.X and add pcp.gif)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A list of required visual assets (images, icons, logos) for the aiascent.dev website and the definitive structure for the `public/assets` directory.\n  - **Tags:** assets, wishlist, design, images, icons, file structure\n\n## 1\\.

Also, update the Hero section visual description (4.2) to mention the `dce-hero-screenshot.png`.\n2.  **Generate A15.1 (Master Image Prompt):** Create the master system prompt for image generation, adapting the style from `aiascentgame` (A179) to the `aiascent.dev` aesthetic.\n3.  **Generate Individual Image Prompts (A15.2 - A15.6):** Create specific prompts for the remaining assets in A15 (Logo, Icons, OG Image).\n4.  **Update A0 and A15:** Update the Master Artifact List (A0) with the new A15.x artifacts and update A15 to reflect the status of the assets and the new GIF.\n5.  **Port Dynamic Components (T-3):** Copy the necessary advanced UI components from the `automationsaas` context (M7) into the `aiascent.dev` project (`src/components/global`). This includes `ContainerScroll`, `SparklesCore`, `LampComponent`, and `3d-card`.\n6.  **Implement Home Page Sections (T-3):** Create the new home page section components (`HeroSection.tsx`, `FeaturesSection.tsx`, `WorkflowVisualization.tsx`, `MissionSection.tsx`) based on the updated A16, utilizing the newly ported dynamic components.\n7.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx` (T-3):** Integrate the new section components into the main landing page.\n8.  **Update Header and Footer (T-3):** Refine the styling and add the navigation links (Learn, Mission) defined in the planning artifacts.\n9.  **Update A4 (Task Checklist):** Mark T-3 as in progress.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A16: aiascent.dev - Page Design: Home (Landing Page)\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C3 (Incorporate pcp.gif into Workflow Visualization and refine Hero visual)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Detailed design blueprint for the main landing page (Home) of aiascent.dev, focusing on the value proposition, aesthetics, and user engagement.\n  - **Tags:** page design, home page, landing page, ui, ux, dce, citizen architect\n\n## 1\\. Purpose and Goal\n\nThe Home page is the primary entry point for all visitors. Its goal is to immediately convey the purpose and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), establishing credibility and motivating developers to explore the tool and the underlying philosophy of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n## 2\\. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  \\* **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple).\n  \\* **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  \\* Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  \\* Logo on the left, navigation links (Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component in the `automationsaas` context) to add depth.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  \\* **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  \\* **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  \\* **Visual:** The centerpiece will be the `dce-hero-screenshot.png` (A15, AS-03). This screenshot shows the DCE in action (FTV and PCPP panes open). It will be presented within a stylized container (like the `ContainerScroll` component from AutomationSaaS) to give it a dynamic, engaging feel.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A two-column or alternating layout highlighting the inefficiencies of standard AI workflows and how DCE solves them.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools. Start Building the Future.\"\n  \\* **Points (Visualized with Icons from A15):**\n      \\* **Problem:** Manual context management is slow and error-prone. **Solution (Icon AS-04):** DCE provides intuitive, visual context curation directly in VS Code.\n      \\* **Problem:** Testing AI suggestions is risky and time-consuming. **Solution (Icon AS-05):** The Parallel Co-Pilot enables rapid, side-by-side comparison and safe, Git-integrated testing.\n      \\* **Problem:** AI collaboration lacks structure and auditability. **Solution (Icon AS-06):** DCE captures the entire development process as an iterative, auditable knowledge graph.\n\n### 4.4. Section 3: The DCE Workflow Visualization (Interactive Element)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A visually engaging section demonstrating the workflow in real-time.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"The Power of Iteration: The DCE Workflow in Action\"\n  \\* **Concept (Updated C3):** Instead of a static diagram, we will feature the `pcp.gif` (A15, AS-08). This animated GIF runs through a complete DCE cycle: opening a workspace, onboarding, and pasting/parsing 4 responses.\n  \\* **Presentation:** The GIF should be prominently displayed, perhaps within a stylized browser or VS Code window mockup, with surrounding text explaining the steps shown in the animation.\n\n### 4.5. Section 4: The Mission (Cognitive Capitalism)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A more text-focused section with a strong visual anchor (perhaps utilizing the `LampComponent` aesthetic from `automationsaas` for dramatic lighting).\n  \\* **Headline:** \"More Than Code: The Rise of Cognitive Capitalism.\"\n  \\* **Content:** A brief, compelling summary of the strategic vision—that mastering AI collaboration is essential for competitiveness and individual empowerment. This section connects the tool (DCE) to the broader mission (combating AI centralization and domination policies).\n  \\* **CTA:** \"Read Our Mission\" (Links to `/mission`).\n\n### 4.6. Footer\n\n  \\* Standard site footer (from `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`).\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.1-Master-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15.1: aiascent.dev - Master Image Generation System Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** The master system prompt used to guide AI image generation for aiascent.dev, ensuring a consistent, professional, and sophisticated aesthetic suitable for developer tools.\n  - **Tags:** assets, design, images, prompt engineering, system prompt, aesthetic\n\n## 1\\. Purpose\n\nThis document provides the master system prompt to be used for generating all visual assets (icons, logos, promotional images) for the aiascent.dev website. Its goal is to establish a consistent aesthetic that reflects the nature of the Data Curation Environment (DCE) as a sophisticated, precise, and modern developer tool.\n\n## 2\\. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The DCE Aesthetic**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and UI/UX specialist tasked with creating visual assets for `aiascent.dev`, the promotional website for a high-end Visual Studio Code extension called the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** The guiding aesthetic is **Sophisticated, Precise, and Modern Minimalism**. The visuals should evoke the feeling of advanced developer tooling.\n\n      * **Color Palette:** Primarily monochromatic (blacks, whites, shades of gray) with strategic use of a single, vibrant accent color for highlights and calls to action. The preferred accent is **Electric Blue** or **Cyan**. Avoid overly busy gradients or rainbow palettes.\n      * **Typography (for Logos/OG Images):** Clean, modern, sans-serif fonts.\n      * **Style:** Flat design, line art, or subtle 3D isometric elements are acceptable. Avoid photorealism (unless specifically requested for screenshots), cartoons, or overly ornate styles.\n\n2.  **Asset Type Specific Guidelines:**\n\n      * **Icons (SVG):**\n\n          * Must be simple, clear, and immediately recognizable.\n          * Use a consistent line weight.\n          * Should work well at small sizes (e.g., 24x24px).\n          * The output must be clean SVG code. Do not wrap the SVG code in markdown code blocks (e.g., ` svg ...  `).\n\n      * **Logos (SVG):**\n\n          * Should combine typography with a simple, abstract symbol representing concepts like \"curation,\" \"iteration,\" or \"AI collaboration.\"\n          * Must be versatile enough to work on both dark and light backgrounds.\n          * The output must be clean SVG code. Do not wrap the SVG code in markdown code blocks.\n\n      * **Promotional/OG Images (PNG/WEBP):**\n\n          * Should be high-resolution (1200x630px for OG images).\n          * Combine the logo, a compelling headline, and a subtle background visual that reinforces the aesthetic (e.g., a dark background with a faint circuit pattern or data visualization).\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with a specific `<Asset Request>` detailing the asset needed. You will apply the Master Aesthetic and the Asset Type Specific Guidelines to generate the requested visual asset.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt: Logo (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** The specific prompt used to generate the main logo for aiascent.dev (Asset AS-01).\n  - **Tags:** assets, design, images, prompt engineering, logo\n\n## 1\\.

The aesthetic should be dark, modern, and professional. All sections (Hero, Features, Workflow, Mission) should be present. The `ContainerScroll` and `LampComponent` should render correctly. The `pcp.gif` should display in the Workflow section.\n\n## T-4: Interactive Showcase Implementation (Cycle 4+)\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`\n        - `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`\n        - `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`\n\n  - **Total Tokens:** \\~10,000+\n\n  - **More than one cycle?** Yes\n\n  - **Status:** To Do\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 4.1):** Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` layout based on the design in A17 (Introduction, Component, Meta-Commentary).\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 4.2):** Enhance the core logic and styling for the `InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx` component (e.g., adding a Table of Contents sidebar).\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 4.3):** (Curator Task) Populate `whitepaperContent.json` with actual content (the placeholder is currently minimal).\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1.  Navigate to `/showcase`.\n2.  **Expected:** The page layout should match A17. The interactive component should function correctly with the available data.\n\n## T-5: Plan for Next Cycle\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 5.1):** Review progress, update this checklist, and prioritize tasks for the subsequent cycle.\n\n-----\n\n## Completed Tasks\n\n## T-2: Strategic Planning and Asset Management (Cycle 2)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C2)\n\n## T-1: Project Scaffolding (Cycle 1)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C1)\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<summary\\>\nThis cycle focused on executing the user's requests: generating image prompts for the required assets and implementing the core structure of the home page (T-3).\n\n**Image Prompt Generation (A15):**\nI successfully created the Master Image Generation System Prompt (A15.1), establishing the aesthetic guidelines for the project. I then generated individual prompts for the Logo (A15.2), the three core feature icons (A15.3-A15.5), and the OG Image (A15.6). The Master Artifact List (A0) was updated to include these new documents.\n\n**Homepage Implementation (T-3):**\nBefore implementation, I updated the Homepage Design (A16) to incorporate the user-provided `pcp.gif` into the Workflow Visualization section, ensuring the design reflected all requirements. I also updated the Asset Wishlist (A15) to include the GIF.\n\nI then ported several advanced UI components from the `automationsaas` context: `3d-card.tsx`, `container-scroll-animation.tsx`, and `lamp.tsx`. These were adapted slightly to fit the `aiascent.dev` theming system.\n\nThe main sections of the home page were implemented as new components:\n\n  * `HeroSection.tsx`: Utilizes the `ContainerScroll` component to display the headline and the `dce-hero-screenshot.png`.\n  * `FeaturesSection.tsx`: A clean, card-based layout highlighting the core benefits.\n  * `WorkflowVisualization.tsx`: Features the `pcp.gif` with accompanying explanatory text.\n  * `MissionSection.tsx`: Utilizes the `LampContainer` for a dramatic presentation of the project's mission.\n\nThese components were integrated into `src/app/page.tsx`. Furthermore, the `Header.tsx` was updated with the correct navigation links (Learn, Mission), and placeholder pages for these routes were created.\n\nThe project now has a visually rich and structured landing page aligned with the design vision.\n\n**Files Updated/Created:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.1-Master-Image-Generation-System-Prompt.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.3-Image-Prompt-Icon-Context-Curation.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.4-Image-Prompt-Icon-Parallel-Copilot.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.5-Image-Prompt-Icon-Iterative-Workflow.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.6-Image-Prompt-OG-Image.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/learn/page.tsx (New)\n  * src/app/mission/page.tsx (New)\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/3d-card.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/lamp.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n  * src/components/ui/card.tsx\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\n\n1.  **Generate Images:** Please take the prompts generated in A15.2 through A15.6 and use your preferred image generation tool to create the corresponding assets. Place the generated files in the locations specified in A15 (e.g., `public/assets/logo.svg`, `public/assets/icons/context-curation.svg`, etc.).\n2.  **Place `pcp.gif`:** Please place the `pcp.gif` file you mentioned into `public/assets/images/pcp.gif`.

        "12": {
          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis cycle (C3) focuses on two main areas: establishing the visual identity pipeline and implementing the core structure of the Home page (T-3).\n\nFirst, I addressed the visual assets. I updated the Asset Wishlist (A15) to include the `pcp.gif` provided by the curator and updated the Home Page Design (A16) to utilize this GIF in the Hero section for a dynamic visualization of the DCE. I then created the Master Image Generation System Prompt (A15.1), defining the aesthetic direction—\"Algorithmic Elegance\"—which blends the precision of code with the sophistication of modern design. Following this guide, I generated specific prompts for the Logo (A15.2) and the core feature icons (A15.3, A15.4, A15.5), and updated the Master Artifact List (A0).\n\nSecond, I began the implementation of the Home Page (T-3). To leverage the stylized components from the `automationsaas` context, I ported over several key dynamic components: `3d-card.tsx`, `container-scroll-animation.tsx`, `lamp.tsx`, and `sparkles.tsx` into `src/components/global`.\n\nI then created the main sections of the home page:\n\n  - `HeroSection.tsx`: Utilizes the `ContainerScroll` component to dynamically display the `pcp.gif`, immediately showcasing the DCE in action.\n  - `FeaturesSection.tsx`: A clear, icon-driven section highlighting the core benefits of the DCE.\n  - `MissionSection.tsx`: Uses the visually striking `LampComponent` to introduce the strategic vision.\n  - `WorkflowVisualization.tsx`: A placeholder component for the workflow diagram.\n\nThese sections were integrated into `src/app/page.tsx`, replacing the previous placeholder content. I also updated the `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` to align with the navigation structure defined in the design artifacts.\n\nFinally, I updated the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to reflect the completion of the initial Home Page implementation.\n\n**Files Updated:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.1-Master-Image-System-Prompt.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.3-Image-Prompt-Icon-Context-Curation.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.4-Image-Prompt-Icon-Parallel-Copilot.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.5-Image-Prompt-Icon-Iterative-Workflow.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/3d-card.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/lamp.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/sparkles.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/WorkflowVisualization.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Update A16 (Home Page Design):** Modify Section 4.2 to incorporate the `pcp.gif` as the primary visual in the Hero section, replacing the static screenshot.\n2.  **Update A15 (Asset Wishlist):** Add `pcp.gif` to the wishlist and update the entry for the static screenshot.\n3.  **Generate A15.1 (Master Image System Prompt):** Create the new artifact defining the \"Algorithmic Elegance\" aesthetic for `aiascent.dev`.\n4.  **Generate A15.2 (Logo Prompt):** Create the prompt artifact for the main logo.\n5.  **Generate A15.3 (Icon Prompt - Context Curation):** Create the prompt artifact for the context curation icon.\n6.  **Generate A15.4 (Icon Prompt - Parallel Co-Pilot):** Create the prompt artifact for the parallel co-pilot icon.\n7.  **Generate A15.5 (Icon Prompt - Iterative Workflow):** Create the prompt artifact for the iterative workflow icon.\n8.  **Update A0 (Master Artifact List):** Register the new A15.X artifacts.\n9.  **Port `ContainerScroll` Component:** Copy `container-scroll-animation.tsx` from `automationsaas` context to `src/components/global/`.\n10. **Port `LampComponent` and Dependencies:** Copy `lamp.tsx` and `sparkles.tsx` from `automationsaas` context to `src/components/global/`.\n11. **Port `3d-card` Component:** Copy `3d-card.tsx` from `automationsaas` context to `src/components/global/`.\n12. **Implement `HeroSection.tsx`:** Create the Hero section component, integrating `ContainerScroll` and the `pcp.gif`.\n13. **Implement `FeaturesSection.tsx`:** Create the Features section component using the icon placeholders.\n14. **Implement `MissionSection.tsx`:** Create the Mission section component, integrating `LampComponent`.\n15. **Implement `WorkflowVisualization.tsx`:** Create a basic/placeholder implementation for the workflow visualization.\n16. **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** Integrate the new home page components.\n17. **Update `Header.tsx`:** Update navigation links (Home, Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub).\n18. **Update `Footer.tsx`:** Refine footer content and links.\n19. **Update A4 (Task Checklist):** Mark T-3 initial implementation as complete.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\n\n1.  **Asset Placement:** Please ensure the `pcp.gif` file is placed in the location specified in the updated A15: `public/assets/images/pcp-workflow.gif`.\n2.  **Image Generation:** Please take the prompts generated in A15.2 through A15.5 and use your preferred image generation tool (e.g., Nano Banana, Midjourney, DALL-E 3) to create the corresponding SVG assets.

Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  \\* **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple). The aesthetic is defined as \"Algorithmic Elegance\" (See A15.1).\n  \\* **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  \\* Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  \\* Logo on the left, navigation links (Home, Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component) to add depth.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  \\* **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  \\* **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  \\* **Visual (Updated C3):** The centerpiece will be the `pcp-workflow.gif` (A15, AS-08), an animation demonstrating the full DCE workflow. This will be presented within a stylized container (like the `ContainerScroll` component) to give it a dynamic, engaging feel and immediately show the tool in action.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A three-column grid layout highlighting the core features of the DCE.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools. Start Building the Future.\"\n  \\* **Points (Visualized with Icons from A15):**\n      \\* **Context Curation (Icon AS-04):** Intuitive, visual context curation directly in VS Code. Eliminate manual file management and ensure prompt precision.\n      \\* **Parallel Co-Pilot (Icon AS-05):** Generate, compare, and test multiple AI solutions simultaneously. Transform \"accept/reject\" into strategic selection.\n      \\* **Iterative Workflow (Icon AS-06):** A structured, cycle-based approach with Git integration for rapid iteration, safe testing, and auditable development history.\n\n### 4.4. Section 3: The DCE Workflow Visualization (Interactive Element)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A visually engaging, potentially interactive diagram illustrating the DCE cycle.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"The Power of Iteration: The DCE Workflow\"\n  \\* **Concept:** A stylized visualization showing the steps: 1. Curate Context -\\> 2. Generate Prompt -\\> 3. Parallel AI Responses -\\> 4. Test & Select -\\> 5. Integrate & Commit.\n  \\* *UI Idea:* Use subtle animations or hover effects to highlight each step of the workflow.\n\n### 4.5. Section 4: The Mission (Cognitive Capitalism)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A more text-focused section with a strong visual anchor (utilizing the `LampComponent` aesthetic for dramatic lighting).\n  \\* **Headline:** \"More Than Code: The Rise of Cognitive Capitalism.\"\n  \\* **Content:** A brief, compelling summary of the strategic vision—that mastering AI collaboration is essential for competitiveness and individual empowerment. This section connects the tool (DCE) to the broader mission (combating AI centralization and domination policies).\n  \\* **CTA:** \"Read Our Mission\" (Links to `/mission`).\n\n### 4.6. Footer\n\n  \\* Standard site footer (from `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`).\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15: aiascent.dev - Asset Wishlist and Directory Structure\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C3 (Add pcp.gif and update status)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A list of required visual assets (images, icons, logos) for the aiascent.dev website and the definitive structure for the `public/assets` directory.\n  - **Tags:** assets, wishlist, design, images, icons, file structure\n\n## 1\\.

Purpose\n\nThis document provides the master system prompt to guide AI image generation tools in creating a consistent, sophisticated, and thematically coherent visual identity for the aiascent.dev website.\n\n## 2\\. The System Prompt: Algorithmic Elegance\n\n**Master System Prompt: The Aesthetic of Algorithmic Elegance**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and digital artist specializing in branding for high-end developer tools and futuristic technology platforms. Your task is to generate visual assets (logos, icons, illustrations) for `aiascent.dev`, the home of the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n**Your Guiding Aesthetic: Algorithmic Elegance**\n\n\"Algorithmic Elegance\" is the fusion of mathematical precision, the fluidity of advanced AI, and the sophistication of modern minimalist design. It should evoke the feeling of powerful, intelligent tools that enhance human capability.\n\n**Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Color Palette:** The primary aesthetic is **dark-mode-first**.\n\n      * **Backgrounds:** Deep blacks (\\#000000), dark charcoals (\\#1E1E1E), and midnight blues (\\#0A0F1A).\n      * **Accents (The \"Digital Glow\"):** Use vibrant, futuristic accent colors for highlights, lines, and focal points.\n          * Electric Blue (\\#007BFF)\n          * Cyan / Teal (\\#00FFFF)\n          * Deep Violet (\\#6A0DAD)\n      * **Neutrals:** Use cool grays (\\#A0AEC0) sparingly for secondary elements.\n\n2.  **Style and Form:**\n\n      * **Minimalism and Precision:** Favor clean lines, geometric shapes, and uncluttered compositions. Every element must feel intentional and precise, like well-written code.\n      * **Vector Focus:** All assets (logos, icons) must be generated as clean, scalable SVGs.\n      * **The \"Holographic\" Effect:** When depicting interfaces or abstract concepts, use subtle gradients, transparency, and glowing edges to suggest advanced, holographic technology. Avoid skeumorphism.\n      * **Data Visualization Motifs:** Integrate abstract motifs inspired by data visualization, networks, file trees, and branching paths (representing the iterative workflow).\n\n3.  **Thematic Resonance (The Citizen Architect):**\n\n      * The visuals should convey empowerment, intelligence, and mastery. The user is the \"Citizen Architect,\" and the tools are extensions of their intellect.\n      * Evoke themes of structure, iteration, and the human-AI partnership.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with specific requests for assets (e.g., \"Logo for aiascent.dev\" or \"Icon for Context Curation\"). You will interpret these requests through the lens of Algorithmic Elegance, adhering strictly to the color palette, style directives, and thematic resonance defined above. Generate the asset as a clean SVG.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15.2: aiascent.dev - Image Prompt: Logo\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** The specific prompt for generating the main logo (AS-01) for aiascent.dev, following the \"Algorithmic Elegance\" aesthetic.\n  - **Tags:** assets, design, prompt engineering, logo\n\n## 1\\.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis cycle focuses on executing the Home Page implementation (T-3 in A4) and addressing the user's requests regarding asset generation prompts and incorporating the new `pcp.gif`.\n\nFirst, I updated the Home Page Design (A16) to incorporate the `pcp.gif` alongside the existing screenshot in the Hero section, utilizing the dynamic `ContainerScroll` component for presentation.\n\nNext, I created the requested image generation prompt artifacts (A15.1 through A15.7). A15.1 defines the master system prompt, establishing the aesthetic guidelines for all generated images, drawing inspiration from the `aiascentgame` context (A179) but tailored to the professional aesthetic of `aiascent.dev`. The subsequent artifacts provide specific prompts for the logo, favicon, feature icons, and the OG image. I also updated the Master Artifact List (A0) to include these new documents.\n\nFor the implementation (T-3), I began by importing the necessary dynamic UI components from the `automationsaas` context (`ContainerScroll`, `LampComponent`, `SparklesCore`, `3d-card`, `InfiniteMovingCards`) into `src/components/global`. I then updated `tailwind.config.ts` to include the required animations and keyframes for these components.\n\nI implemented the core structure of the home page by creating the section components (`HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowSection`, `MissionSection`) in `src/components/home` and integrating them into `src/app/page.tsx`. The `HeroSection` now uses the `ContainerScroll` component to display the DCE screenshot and the new GIF (assuming it's placed at `public/assets/images/pcp.gif`). The `FeaturesSection` uses the placeholder icons, and the `MissionSection` utilizes the dramatic `LampComponent`.\n\nFinally, I refined the `Header` and `Footer` components to align with the dark, sophisticated aesthetic defined in A16, ensuring a cohesive look across the site. The Universal Task Checklist (A4) has been updated to reflect the completion of these tasks.\n\n**Files Updated/Created:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.1-Master-Image-System-Prompt.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.3-Image-Prompt-Favicon.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.4-Image-Prompt-Icon-ContextCuration.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.5-Image-Prompt-Icon-ParallelCopilot.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.6-Image-Prompt-Icon-IterativeWorkflow.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.7-Image-Prompt-OGImage.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/3d-card.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/infinite-moving-cards.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/lamp.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/sparkles.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n  * tailwind.config.ts\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Update A16 (Home Page Design):** Modify the Hero section design (4.2) to incorporate the `pcp.gif` alongside the screenshot, utilizing the `ContainerScroll` component.\n2.  **Create A15.1 (Master Image System Prompt):** Generate the master system prompt artifact, adapting A179 for the `aiascent.dev` aesthetic.\n3.  **Create A15.X Artifacts (Specific Image Prompts):** Generate individual prompt artifacts (A15.2 - A15.7) for the logo, favicon, icons, and OG image listed in A15.\n4.  **Update A0 (Master Artifact List):** Add entries for the new A15.X artifacts.\n5.  **Import Dynamic Components:** Copy `ContainerScroll`, `LampComponent`, `SparklesCore`, `3d-card`, and `InfiniteMovingCards` from the `automationsaas` context into `src/components/global`.\n6.  **Update `tailwind.config.ts`:** Merge the necessary keyframes and animations from the `automationsaas` configuration to support the imported dynamic components.\n7.  **Create Home Page Sections:** Implement `HeroSection.tsx`, `FeaturesSection.tsx`, `WorkflowSection.tsx`, and `MissionSection.tsx` in `src/components/home`.\n8.  **Update Layout Components:** Refine `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` to match the sophisticated, dark aesthetic defined in A16.\n9.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** Integrate the new section components and remove placeholder content.\n10. **Update A4 (Task Checklist):** Mark T-3 as complete and update the plan for the next cycle.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A16: aiascent.dev - Page Design: Home (Landing Page)\n\n# Date Created: C2\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C3 (Incorporate pcp.gif into the Hero section)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Detailed design blueprint for the main landing page (Home) of aiascent.dev, focusing on the value proposition, aesthetics, and user engagement.\n  - **Tags:** page design, home page, landing page, ui, ux, dce, citizen architect\n\n## 1\\. Purpose and Goal\n\nThe Home page is the primary entry point for all visitors. Its goal is to immediately convey the purpose and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), establishing credibility and motivating developers to explore the tool and the underlying philosophy of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n## 2\\. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  \\* **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple). The background should be dark and immersive (e.g., `bg-neutral-950` or similar).\n  \\* **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  \\* Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  \\* The header should be fixed or sticky, with a dark, semi-transparent background (`bg-black/40 backdrop-blur-lg`) to maintain the aesthetic.\n  \\* Logo on the left, navigation links (Home, Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component in the `automationsaas` context) to add depth.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  \\* **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  \\* **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  \\* **Visual (Updated C3):** The centerpiece will utilize the `ContainerScroll` component (from AutomationSaaS) to provide a dynamic, engaging presentation. Inside the ContainerScroll, we will feature a combination of the `dce-hero-screenshot.png` (A15, AS-03) and the `pcp.gif` (located at `public/assets/images/pcp.gif`) to show both the interface and the workflow in action.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution (Features)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A three-column grid of cards (potentially using `3d-card` component for subtle depth).\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools.

Purpose\n\nThis document provides the master system prompt to be used when generating visual assets (icons, logos, illustrations) for the aiascent.dev website. Its goal is to ensure a consistent, high-quality, and thematically coherent visual identity across the entire site.\n\n## 2\\. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The DCE Aesthetic**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer and digital artist specializing in creating assets for sophisticated developer tools and strategic platforms. Your task is to generate visual assets for aiascent.dev, the official website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code extension.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** The aesthetic is **Modern, Precise, and Futuristic Minimalism**.\n\n      * **Color Palette:** Primarily monochromatic (blacks, whites, grays) with strategic use of vibrant, futuristic accent colors (Electric Blue, Cyan, Deep Purple). Assets must look excellent on both dark and light backgrounds, but prioritize a **dark-mode-first** appearance.\n      * **Style:** Clean lines, sharp edges, and geometric shapes. Avoid excessive ornamentation, gradients (unless subtle and used for depth), or cartoonish styles. The look should evoke precision engineering, advanced technology, and clarity of thought.\n      * **Themes:** The underlying themes are Human-AI collaboration, workflow efficiency, data management, and the concept of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n2.  **Asset Specific Guidelines:**\n\n      * **Logos & Icons (SVG):**\n\n          * Must be vector-based (SVG).\n          * Must be simple, scalable, and instantly recognizable even at small sizes.\n          * Use solid colors or very subtle gradients.\n          * Ensure paths are clean and optimized.\n\n      * **Illustrations & Hero Images (PNG/WEBP):**\n\n          * Should be high-resolution and professional.\n          * If depicting technology (like screenshots or abstract visualizations), maintain the clean, minimalist aesthetic.\n          * Lighting should be dramatic but clean, often using the accent colors to highlight key elements.\n\n3.  **Thematic Cohesion:** Every asset must reinforce the idea that the DCE is a powerful, professional tool that enhances human intelligence and streamlines complex workflows.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with specific requests for assets (e.g., \"Icon for Context Curation\"). You will apply these Master Aesthetic guidelines to generate the requested asset in the specified format.\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Image-Prompt-Logo.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15.2: Image Prompt - Logo (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Specific prompt for generating the main logo (AS-01) for aiascent.dev.\n  - **Tags:** assets, design, images, prompt, logo\n\n## 1\\.

          "content": "\\<summary\\>\nThis cycle focuses on executing Task T-3 (Homepage Implementation) and generating the necessary image prompts for asset creation, as requested by the curator.\n\nFirst, I addressed the curator's request regarding the `pcp.gif`. I updated the Asset Wishlist (A15) to include it and revised the Home Page Design (A16) to specify that this GIF, demonstrating the DCE workflow, should be the centerpiece of the Hero section, utilized within the `ContainerScroll` component.\n\nNext, I generated the requested image prompts. I created A15.1, the Master System Prompt, defining the aesthetic direction for all visual assets. Following this, I generated specific prompts for the Logo (A15.2), the three feature icons (A15.3-5), and the OG Image (A15.6). The Master Artifact List (A0) has been updated to include these new artifacts.\n\nFor the homepage implementation (T-3), I prepared the environment by updating `package.json` with dependencies required for dynamic UI components (like `framer-motion` and `tsparticles`). I then copied the `ContainerScroll`, `LampComponent`, and `SparklesCore` components from the `automationsaas` context into `src/components/global`.\n\nI implemented the core sections of the homepage: `HeroSection` (utilizing `ContainerScroll` and ready for the GIF), `FeaturesSection` (using placeholder icons), and `MissionSection` (utilizing `LampComponent`). These were integrated into `src/app/page.tsx`, and the Header and Footer were updated to reflect the navigation structure defined in the design artifacts.\n\nFinally, I updated the Universal Task Checklist (A4) to reflect the progress on T-3.\n\n**Files Created/Updated:**\n\n  * src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15-Asset-Wishlist.md\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.1-Master-Image-System-Prompt.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.2-Prompt-Logo.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.3-Prompt-Icon-Context-Curation.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.4-Prompt-Icon-Parallel-Copilot.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.5-Prompt-Icon-Iterative-Workflow.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A15.6-Prompt-OG-Image.md (New)\n  * src/Artifacts/A16-Page-Design-Home.md\n  * package.json\n  * src/app/page.tsx\n  * src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/lamp.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/global/sparkles.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx (New)\n  * src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n  * src/components/layout/Footer.tsx\n\n\\</summary\\>\n\n\\<course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n1.  **Update A15 (Asset Wishlist):** Add the `pcp.gif` to the asset list (AS-08).\n2.  **Update A16 (Home Page Design):** Modify the Hero section (4.2) to utilize the `pcp.gif` as the primary visual within the `ContainerScroll` component.\n3.  **Generate Image Prompts:**\n      * Create A15.1 (Master System Prompt).\n      * Create A15.2 (Logo Prompt - AS-01).\n      * Create A15.3 (Context Curation Icon Prompt - AS-04).\n      * Create A15.4 (Parallel Co-Pilot Icon Prompt - AS-05).\n      * Create A15.5 (Iterative Workflow Icon Prompt - AS-06).\n      * Create A15.6 (OG Image Prompt - AS-07).\n4.  **Update A0 (Master Artifact List):** Add the new A15.X artifacts.\n5.  **Prepare for Homepage Implementation (T-3):**\n      * Update `package.json` to include `framer-motion`, `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/slim`, `@tsparticles/engine`.\n      * Copy dynamic components from `automationsaas` (M7) to `src/components/global/`:\n          * `container-scroll-animation.tsx`\n          * `lamp.tsx`\n          * `sparkles.tsx`\n6.  **Implement Homepage Sections (T-3):**\n      * Create `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`.\n      * Create `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`.\n      * Create `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`.\n7.  **Update Core Files (T-3):**\n      * Update `src/app/page.tsx` to integrate the new sections.\n      * Update `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` and `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` with refined navigation and styling.\n8.  **Update A4 (Task Checklist):** Mark relevant T-3 tasks as complete and update the plan.\n    \\</course\\_of\\_action\\>\n\n\\<curator\\_activity\\>\n\n1.  **Install Dependencies:** Please run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install the new dependencies added to `package.json` (`framer-motion` and `tsparticles` libraries).\n2.  **Place GIF Asset:** Please place the `pcp.gif` file into the `public/assets/images/` directory.

Purpose and Goal\n\nThe Home page is the primary entry point for all visitors. Its goal is to immediately convey the purpose and power of the Data Curation Environment (DCE), establishing credibility and motivating developers to explore the tool and the underlying philosophy of the \"Citizen Architect.\"\n\n## 2\\. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Software developers, AI engineers, technical project managers.\nSecondary: Strategic thinkers, policymakers interested in AI human capital.\n\n## 3\\. Aesthetic and Tone\n\n  \\* **Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, modern, and precise. We will adopt a dark-mode-first design (similar to high-end developer tools like VS Code or Linear) with vibrant, futuristic accents (e.g., electric blue, cyan, or deep purple).\n  \\* **Tone:** Authoritative, inspiring, and urgent. The copy should emphasize the transformative potential of the DCE and the strategic necessity of mastering AI-assisted development.\n\n## 4\\. Page Structure and Content\n\n### 4.1. Header/Navigation\n\n  \\* Standard site header (from `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`).\n  \\* Logo on the left, navigation links (Home, Showcase, Learn, Mission, GitHub) in the center or right, and the dark/light mode toggle.\n\n### 4.2. Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A large, impactful section utilizing a dark background, potentially with subtle background animations (e.g., particles or a faint grid, similar to the `SparklesCore` component in the `automationsaas` context) to add depth.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Master the Human-AI Workflow. Become a Citizen Architect.\"\n  \\* **Subheadline:** \"The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray. Curate context with precision, test AI solutions rapidly, and build complex systems with confidence.\"\n  \\* **CTA:** Primary Button: \"Explore the Showcase\" (Links to `/showcase`). Secondary Button: \"Download Now\" (Links to GitHub releases or VS Code Marketplace).\n  \\* **Visual (Updated C3):** The centerpiece will be the `pcp.gif` (A15, AS-08), an animated demonstration of the DCE workflow. This will be presented within a stylized container (the `ContainerScroll` component from AutomationSaaS) to give it a dynamic, engaging feel.\n\n### 4.3. Section 2: The Problem & The Solution\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A three-column grid highlighting the core features and how DCE solves common AI workflow problems.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"Stop Fighting Your Tools. Start Building the Future.\"\n  \\* **Points (Visualized with Icons from A15):**\n      \\* **Feature 1 (Icon AS-04): Precision Context Curation.** Stop manually managing context. DCE provides intuitive, visual file selection directly in VS Code.\n      \\* **Feature 2 (Icon AS-05): The Parallel Co-Pilot.** Don't rely on a single AI response. Rapidly compare multiple solutions side-by-side and test safely with Git integration.\n      \\* **Feature 3 (Icon AS-06): Iterative Knowledge Graph.** Transform your process into an asset. DCE captures the entire development cycle as an auditable knowledge graph.\n\n### 4.4. Section 3: The DCE Workflow Visualization (Interactive Element)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A visually engaging, potentially interactive diagram illustrating the DCE cycle.\n  \\* **Headline:** \"The Power of Iteration: The DCE Workflow\"\n  \\* **Concept:** A stylized visualization showing the steps: 1. Curate Context -\\> 2. Generate Prompt -\\> 3. Parallel AI Responses -\\> 4. Test & Select -\\> 5. Integrate & Commit.\n  \\* *UI Idea:* Use subtle animations or hover effects to highlight each step of the workflow.\n\n### 4.5. Section 4: The Mission (Cognitive Capitalism)\n\n  \\* **Layout:** A more text-focused section with a strong visual anchor (utilizing the `LampComponent` aesthetic from `automationsaas` for dramatic lighting).\n  \\* **Headline:** \"More Than Code: The Rise of Cognitive Capitalism.\"\n  \\* **Content:** A brief, compelling summary of the strategic vision—that mastering AI collaboration is essential for competitiveness and individual empowerment. This section connects the tool (DCE) to the broader mission (combating AI centralization and domination policies).\n  \\* **CTA:** \"Read Our Mission\" (Links to `/mission`).\n\n### 4.6. Footer\n\n  \\* Standard site footer (from `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`).\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.1-Master-Image-System-Prompt.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15.1: aiascent.dev - Master Image System Prompt\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** The master system prompt defining the aesthetic direction, style, and thematic consistency for all visual assets generated for the aiascent.dev website.\n  - **Tags:** assets, design, prompt engineering, style guide, visual identity\n\n## 1\\. Purpose\n\nThis document provides the master system prompt to be used when generating any visual assets (icons, logos, illustrations) for the aiascent.dev website. Its goal is to ensure a cohesive, professional, and recognizable visual identity that reflects the nature of the Data Curation Environment (DCE).\n\n## 2\\. The System Prompt\n\n**Master System Prompt: The AIAscent.dev Visual Identity**\n\nYou are an expert graphic designer specializing in branding and iconography for sophisticated developer tools. Your task is to generate visual assets for aiascent.dev, the official website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code extension.\n\n**Your Core Directives:**\n\n1.  **Adhere to the Master Aesthetic:** The aesthetic is **Modern, Precise, and Sophisticated**. It should evoke the feeling of high-end development environments (like VS Code, Linear, or modern IDEs).\n\n      * **Color Palette:** Primarily monochromatic with strategic use of vibrant accents. The design must work flawlessly on a dark background (primary focus) but also be adaptable to light backgrounds.\n          * *Primary (Dark Background):* Deep charcoal or near-black (\\#111827 or similar).\n          * *Foreground/Text:* Off-white or light gray (\\#F3F4F6).\n          * *Accents:* Electric Blue (\\#3B82F6), Cyan (\\#06B6D4), or Deep Purple (\\#8B5CF6). Use accents sparingly for highlights, connections, or active states.\n      * **Style:** Clean lines, geometric shapes, and a minimalist approach. Avoid excessive gradients, shadows, or photorealism in iconography. The style is \"flat design 2.0\" – subtle depth without being skeumorphic.\n      * **Typography (For reference in logos/illustrations):** Modern, sans-serif, highly legible (e.g., Inter, Roboto, SF Pro).\n\n2.  **Thematic Resonance:** The visuals should subtly reflect the core concepts of the DCE:\n\n      * **Curation & Precision:** Elements should feel organized, structured, and deliberate.\n      * **Iteration & Workflow:** Use of circular elements, arrows, or branching paths can evoke the iterative cycle.\n      * **Human-AI Collaboration:** Subtle motifs of connection, networks, or dual elements working together.\n\n3.  **Asset Specific Guidelines:**\n\n      * **Icons (SVG):** Must be simple, recognizable at small sizes (e.g., 24x24px), and use the defined color palette. They should be exported as clean SVG code.\n      * **Logos (SVG):** Must be scalable and professional. The logo should convey the name \"AIAscent.dev\" or an abstract symbol representing the project's goals.\n      * **Illustrations/Banners (PNG/WEBP):** Can be more detailed but must maintain the aesthetic. They should look professional and high-tech, avoiding cartoonish or overly playful styles.\n\n**Your Workflow:**\n\nI will provide you with specific requests for assets (e.g., \"Generate the Context Curation Icon\"). You will apply these Master Directives to create the requested asset and provide the output in the specified format (SVG code or image file).\n\\</file\\_artifact\\>\n\n\\<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A15.2-Prompt-Logo.md\"\\>\n\n# Artifact A15.2: Image Prompt - Logo (AS-01)\n\n# Date Created: C3\n\n# Author: AI Model\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** Image generation prompt for the main logo of aiascent.dev (Asset AS-01).\n  - **Tags:** assets, design, prompt, logo, as-01\n\n## 1\\.

My plan is to first address the missing `tsparticles` dependencies, then correct the layout problems, including the header overlay, the large blank space, and the clipped text. I will also update the feature icons to use the provided PNGs and adjust the hero section to focus on a single, more dynamic visual. Finally, I will address the z-index issue causing the sparkles to render in front of the text and apply a visual refresh to the workflow section to make it feel more interactive.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `package.json`:** Add the missing `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/engine`, and `@tsparticles/slim` dependencies to resolve the build errors.\n2.  **Update `src/app/layout.tsx`:** Add top padding to the main layout to prevent the fixed header from overlapping the page content.\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Modify the hero section to resolve the \"split image\" issue by focusing on a single, more dynamic visual (`pcp.gif`). This will also help address the large blank space below the hero section by simplifying the layout structure.\n4.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** Add padding to the section title to prevent text from being cut off. I will also update the image paths to use the provided `.png` icons instead of the placeholder `.svg` files and remove the `invert` class that is not suitable for PNGs.\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** Refactor the static workflow steps into more visually distinct, card-like elements to give them a more interactive appearance, laying the groundwork for future functionality.\n6.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** Fix the stacking order issue by removing the `isolate` class from a container, which will ensure the text content (`z-50`) correctly renders on top of the background sparkle effect (`z-0`).\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.3.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.3.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n```\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/layout.tsx\">\n```tsx\nimport type { Metadata } from \"next\";\nimport { Inter } from \"next/font/google\";\nimport \"./globals.css\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers/theme-provider\";\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/layout/Footer\";\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: [\"latin\"] });\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\ntitle: \"AIAscent.dev | Home of the Data Curation Environment\",\ndescription: \"The official website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.

I will also update the `Image` component `src` paths to use the new `.png` icons (`context-curation.png`, `parallel-copilot.png`, `iterative-workflow.png`) instead of the SVG placeholders.\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** I will enhance the styling of the static workflow visualization to make it appear more like a connected process flow, improving its visual appeal pending future interactivity.\n6.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will review the z-index values within the LampContainer to ensure the sparkles effect renders behind the text content as intended.\n7.  **Add Curator Activity:** I will include instructions for the curator to run `npm install` to install the newly added dependencies.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nRun `npm install` in your terminal to install the new dependencies for the sparkles/particles effect.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/page.tsx\">\n// src/app/page.tsx\n// C4 - Adjust layout for fixed header\nimport HeroSection from \"@/components/home/HeroSection\";\nimport FeaturesSection from \"@/components/home/FeaturesSection\";\nimport WorkflowSection from \"@/components/home/WorkflowSection\";\nimport MissionSection from \"@/components/home/MissionSection\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\nreturn (\n<div className=\"flex flex-col pt-16\">\n<HeroSection />\n\n\n  {/* Added a separator/spacer for visual distinction */}\n  <div className=\"mt-[10rem] md:mt-[18rem]\">\n    <FeaturesSection />\n  </div>\n\n  <WorkflowSection />\n  \n  {/* Mission Section uses LampContainer which handles its own background/layout */}\n  <MissionSection />\n</div>\n\n\n);\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C4 - Refactor to single hero visual (GIF)\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-100px] md:mt-[-50px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            Workflow.\n            <br/>\n            Become a Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

My course of action is to address the dependency issues and the specific UI/UX problems identified in the hero, features, and mission sections of the homepage. This involves installing missing `tsparticles` libraries, correcting layout and spacing issues, updating asset paths to use the new PNG icons, and fixing the layering of the sparkle effects.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`package.json`:** Add the required `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/engine`, and `@tsparticles/slim` dependencies to resolve the TypeScript errors.\n2.  **`src/app/layout.tsx`:** Add top padding to the main content area to prevent the fixed header from overlapping the page content, addressing the issue from screenshot 1.\n3.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Rework the `ContainerScroll` component's content. I will remove the two-column grid and feature the `pcp.gif` as the single, primary visual element to resolve the \"split image\" issue. I will also reduce the overall height of this section to eliminate the large blank space noted in screenshot 2.\n4.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Add bottom padding to the section title (\"Stop Fighting Your Tools...\") to prevent the text from being cut off.\n    *   Update the `features` array to use the `.png` icon files (`context-curation.png`, `parallel-copilot.png`, `iterative-workflow.png`) instead of the previous `.svg` placeholders.\n    *   Remove the `invert` CSS class from the icon `Image` components as it's no longer needed for PNGs.\n5.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** Integrate the `SparklesCore` component directly into this section, placing it in the background behind the main text content to ensure it renders correctly as a backdrop, fixing the layering issue from screenshot 3.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nAfter accepting these file changes, please run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) in your terminal to install the new dependencies added to `package.json`.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/layout.tsx\">\nimport type { Metadata } from \"next\";\nimport { Inter } from \"next/font/google\";\nimport \"./globals.css\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers/theme-provider\";\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/layout/Footer\";\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: [\"latin\"] });\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\ntitle: \"AIAscent.dev | Home of the Data Curation Environment\",\ndescription: \"The official website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.

Finally, I will enhance the visual presentation of the workflow section and ensure the particle effects in the mission section render correctly behind the text.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Add Dependencies:** Update `package.json` to include `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/engine`, and `@tsparticles/slim` to fix the missing module errors.\n2.  **Add Curator Activity:** Create a `<curator_activity>` block to instruct you to run `npm install` to install the new dependencies.\n3.  **Fix Header Overlap:** Modify `HeroSection.tsx` to add top padding, preventing the fixed header from obscuring the main headline.\n4.  **Correct Hero Visuals:** Update `HeroSection.tsx` to simplify the content within the `ContainerScroll` component, removing the two-column grid and focusing on displaying the `pcp.gif` as the primary, single visual element.\n5.  **Fix \"Fighting\" Text:** In `FeaturesSection.tsx`, add bottom padding to the main heading to prevent the descenders of letters like 'g' from being cut off.\n6.  **Update Feature Icons:** In `FeaturesSection.tsx`, change the image sources for the three feature icons from the placeholder `.svg` files to the provided `.png` files.\n7.  **Enhance Workflow Section:** Update `WorkflowSection.tsx` to improve the visual flow of the steps, making it look more like a connected process.\n8.  **Fix Particle Rendering:** By adding the missing `tsparticles` dependencies, the sparkles in the `MissionSection.tsx` (via `LampContainer.tsx`) should now render correctly as part of the background effect.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nPlease run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependencies required for the particle animations:\n```bash\nnpm install @tsparticles/react @tsparticles/engine @tsparticles/slim\n```\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n```\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C4 - Layout and visual fixes\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-100px] md:mt-[-50px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col pt-16 md:pt-20\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            Workflow.\n            <br/>\n            Become a Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

My course of action is to address the layout issues in the hero section, fix text and image rendering problems, improve the visual presentation of the workflow diagram, and enable the particle effects that are currently disabled due to missing dependencies.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Add Dependencies:** I will update `package.json` to include the necessary `tsparticles` libraries. This will require you to run `npm install` to resolve the missing modules.\n2.  **Fix Header Overlap:** I will adjust the `HeroSection` component by adding top padding to ensure its content is not obscured by the fixed header.\n3.  **Correct Hero Visuals:** In `HeroSection.tsx`, I will modify the layout to display a single, centered visual (`pcp.gif`) instead of the split side-by-side images, creating a more focused presentation.\n4.  **Reduce Blank Space:** I will adjust the vertical margins in `app/page.tsx` to reduce the large empty space below the hero section.\n5.  **Fix \"Fighting\" Text:** In `FeaturesSection.tsx`, I will add padding below the main headline to prevent the text from being cut off.\n6.  **Update Feature Icons:** I will update the `FeaturesSection.tsx` component to use the provided `.png` icon files instead of the previous `.svg` placeholders and remove the `invert` styling which is not suitable for PNGs.\n7.  **Enhance Workflow Visuals:** I will refactor the `WorkflowSection.tsx` to present the five steps in a more visually appealing and process-oriented layout.\n8.  **Enable Sparkle Effect:** Finally, I will uncomment the `SparklesCore` component within `lamp.tsx` to enable the background particle effect for the \"Mission\" section, which should now function correctly with the new dependencies installed.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\n1.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the feedback from the latest screenshots and the provided context. My plan is to address the layout issues, dependency problems, and asset updates to bring the homepage closer to the design vision. I will install the missing `tsparticles` libraries to fix the sparkle animations, adjust the page layout to prevent the header from overlapping content, and correct the hero section's visual display to feature the animated GIF prominently. Additionally, I will fix typography rendering issues, replace the placeholder feature icons with the newly provided PNG assets, and perform a minor style enhancement on the workflow section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `package.json`:** Add the missing `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/engine`, and `@tsparticles/slim` dependencies to resolve the runtime errors with the `SparklesCore` component.\n2.  **Update `src/app/layout.tsx`:** Add top padding to the `main` element to push the page content below the fixed header, resolving the text overlap issue.\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Remove the fixed `h-screen` to allow the `ContainerScroll` component to manage the section's height.\n    *   Reconfigure the content within `ContainerScroll` to remove the two-column grid and prominently feature the `pcp.gif` as a single, centered visual, which better demonstrates the DCE workflow.\n4.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** Adjust the top margin of the `FeaturesSection` wrapper to a negative value. This will pull the section up into the whitespace created by the tall `ContainerScroll` component, fixing the large gap.\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Add padding to the section title to prevent the bottom of letters from being cut off.\n    *   Update the `features` array to use the provided `.png` icon files instead of the `.svg` placeholders.\n    *   Remove the `invert` styling from the icon `Image` components as it is no longer needed for the PNG assets.\n6.  **Update `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** Apply minor styling enhancements to the workflow steps to give them a more defined, card-like appearance, improving the visual hierarchy as a precursor to future interactivity.\n7.  **Add `curator_activity` block:** Instruct the curator to run `npm install` to install the newly added dependencies.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nAfter accepting these changes, please run `npm install` or `yarn install` in your terminal to install the new dependencies required for the particle animations.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n```\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/layout.tsx\">\n```typescript\nimport type { Metadata } from \"next\";\nimport { Inter } from \"next/font/google\";\nimport \"./globals.css\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers/theme-provider\";\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/layout/Footer\";\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: [\"latin\"] });\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\ntitle: \"AIAscent.dev | Home of the Data Curation Environment\",\ndescription: \"The official website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the feedback from the latest screenshots and the provided ephemeral context. My course of action is to address the layout issues, update the assets as requested, and fix the missing dependency that is causing the sparkles effect to fail. I will begin by adding the required `tsparticles` libraries to `package.json` and will include a `curator_activity` block to ensure they are installed. Then, I will adjust the homepage layout to fix the header overlap and the large blank space in the hero section. I will also correct the \"split image\" issue to feature the animated GIF of the DCE workflow prominently. Finally, I will update the features section to use the provided PNG icons and fix the typography clipping issue.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `package.json`:** Add the missing `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/engine`, and `@tsparticles/slim` dependencies to resolve the compilation errors for the sparkles effect.\n2.  **Create `curator_activity`:** Add a block to instruct the curator to run `npm install` to install the new dependencies.\n3.  **Update `src/app/layout.tsx`:** Add padding to the main content area to prevent the fixed header from overlapping the page content on all pages.\n4.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Modify the `ContainerScroll` component's content to display only the `pcp.gif`, fixing the \"split image\" bug. I will also adjust the section's height to reduce the large blank space below it.\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Add padding to the section title to prevent the text from being cut off.\n    *   Update the `features` array to use the `.png` icon files as requested, replacing the `.svg` placeholders.\n    *   Remove the `invert` class from the `Image` components for the icons, as it is not suitable for PNGs.\n6.  **Update `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`:** Reduce the excessive height of the main container to help eliminate the large blank space on the homepage.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nI have added new dependencies to the `package.json` file.

My course of action is to address the layout and styling issues identified in the screenshots, install missing dependencies for the particle effects, and refine the component implementations to better match the user's vision.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Install Missing Dependencies:** I will update `package.json` to include the necessary `@tsparticles` libraries required for the `SparklesCore` component, which is used in the `LampComponent`.\n2.  **Fix Header Overlap:** I will modify `HeroSection.tsx` to add top padding, preventing the fixed header from obscuring the main headline.\n3.  **Correct Hero Visuals:** I will adjust `HeroSection.tsx` to remove the split-image grid within the `ContainerScroll` component. It will now prominently feature the `pcp.gif` to dynamically showcase the DCE workflow, as requested. I will also adjust component heights to reduce the large blank space below this section.\n4.  **Refine Features Section:** I will update `FeaturesSection.tsx` to add padding to the headline to prevent text from being cut off. I will also change the icon paths from `.svg` to the curator-provided `.png` files.\n5.  **Improve Workflow Visualization:** I will update the placeholder `WorkflowSection.tsx` with improved styling to better represent a process flow, making it more visually engaging.\n6.  **Fix Sparkles Effect:** I will review `LampComponent.tsx` and `MissionSection.tsx` to ensure the particle sparkle effect is correctly positioned behind the \"More Than Code\" headline, addressing the layering issue.\n7.  **Update Task Checklist:** I will update `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to reflect the completion of these tasks and outline the next steps for Cycle 5.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nAfter accepting these files, please run `npm install` (or your package manager's equivalent) to install the newly added dependencies for the particle effects.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C4 - Layout and visual corrections\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center relative !overflow-visible\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)] -z-10\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col pt-24 md:pt-32\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            Workflow.\n            <br />\n            Become a Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-lg md:text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C4 (Mark C4 tasks complete, create tasks for C5)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis artifact provides a structured format for tracking development tasks for the `aiascent.dev` website. It organizes work by the group of files involved and estimates complexity (token count and cycle count) to aid in planning for AI-assisted development.\n\n## 2. How to Use\n\n(See M3. Interaction Schema or T17. Template - Universal Task Checklist.md for detailed usage instructions.)\n\n-----\n\n## Task List for Cycle 5+\n\n## T-5: Interactive Workflow Visualization (Cycle 5+)\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`\n\n  - **Total Tokens:** ~1,000\n\n  - **More than one cycle?** No\n\n  - **Status:** To Do\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 5.1):** Enhance `WorkflowSection.tsx` to be more interactive as per user feedback. This could involve using Framer Motion to animate the steps or highlight them on scroll.\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1.  Scroll to the Workflow section on the home page.\n2.  **Expected:** The workflow steps should have some form of animation or interactivity that makes the section more engaging.\n\n## T-6: Interactive Showcase Implementation (Cycle 5+)\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`\n        - `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`\n        - `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`\n\n  - **Total Tokens:** ~10,000+\n\n  - **More than one cycle?** Yes\n\n  - **Status:** To Do\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 6.1):** Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` layout based on the design in A17 (Introduction, Component, Meta-Commentary).\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 6.2):** Enhance the core logic and styling for the `InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx` component (e.g., adding a Table of Contents sidebar).\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 6.3):** (Curator Task) Populate `whitepaperContent.json` with actual content (the placeholder is currently minimal).\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1.  Navigate to `/showcase`.\n2.  **Expected:** The page layout should match A17. The interactive component should function correctly with the available data.\n\n## T-7: Plan for Next Cycle\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 7.1):** Review progress, update this checklist, and prioritize tasks for the subsequent cycle.\n\n-----\n\n## Completed Tasks\n\n## T-4: Homepage Polish and Bug Fixes (Cycle 4)\n- **Status:** Completed (C4)\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.1):** Add missing `@tsparticles` dependencies to `package.json`.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.2):** Add top padding to `HeroSection.tsx` to prevent content from being obscured by the fixed header.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.3):** Correct the `HeroSection.tsx` to display a single `pcp.gif` in the `ContainerScroll` instead of a split view.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.4):** Adjust component heights in `HeroSection` and `ContainerScroll` to reduce the large empty space.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.5):** Add bottom padding to the headline in `FeaturesSection.tsx` to fix text cutoff.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.6):** Update `FeaturesSection.tsx` to use the new `.png` icons instead of `.svg` placeholders.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.7):** Improve the visual styling of the static `WorkflowSection.tsx`.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.8):** Correct the `z-index` and implementation in `LampComponent.tsx` to ensure the sparkles effect appears behind the text content.\n\n## T-3: Home Page Implementation (Cycle 3)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C3)\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.1):** Implement the `HeroSection.tsx` component based on A16.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.2):** Implement the `FeaturesSection.tsx` component based on A16.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.3):** Implement the `WorkflowSection.tsx` component.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.4):** Implement the `MissionSection.tsx` component based on A16.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.5):** Integrate these new components into `src/app/page.tsx`.\n\n## T-2: Strategic Planning and Asset Management (Cycle 2)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C2)\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 2.1):** Create A15 (Asset Wishlist) and generate placeholder assets.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 2.2):** Create page design artifacts (A16-A19).\n\n## T-1: Project Scaffolding (Cycle 1)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C1)\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 1.1):** Generate the initial Next.js project structure.\n</file_artifact><summary>\nI have analyzed the feedback from the current state of the website and will now implement the required changes. My course of action is to address the layout and styling issues identified in the screenshots, install missing dependencies for the particle effects, and refine the component implementations to better match the user's vision.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Install Missing Dependencies:** I will update `package.json` to include the necessary `@tsparticles` libraries required for the `SparklesCore` component, which is used in the `LampComponent`.\n2.  **Fix Header Overlap:** I will modify `HeroSection.tsx` to add top padding, preventing the fixed header from obscuring the main headline.\n3.  **Correct Hero Visuals:** I will adjust `HeroSection.tsx` to remove the split-image grid within the `ContainerScroll` component. It will now prominently feature the `pcp.gif` to dynamically showcase the DCE workflow, as requested. I will also adjust component heights to reduce the large blank space below this section.\n4.  **Refine Features Section:** I will update `FeaturesSection.tsx` to add padding to the headline to prevent text from being cut off. I will also change the icon paths from `.svg` to the curator-provided `.png` files.\n5.  **Improve Workflow Visualization:** I will update the placeholder `WorkflowSection.tsx` with improved styling to better represent a process flow, making it more visually engaging.\n6.  **Fix Sparkles Effect:** I will review `LampComponent.tsx` and `MissionSection.tsx` to ensure the particle sparkle effect is correctly positioned behind the \"More Than Code\" headline, addressing the layering issue.\n7.  **Update Task Checklist:** I will update `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to reflect the completion of these tasks and outline the next steps for Cycle 5.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nAfter accepting these files, please run `npm install` (or your package manager's equivalent) to install the newly added dependencies for the particle effects.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.4.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C4 - Layout and visual corrections\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center relative !overflow-visible\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)] -z-10\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col pt-24 md:pt-32\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            Workflow.\n            <br />\n            Become a Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-lg md:text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C4 (Mark C4 tasks complete, create tasks for C5)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThis artifact provides a structured format for tracking development tasks for the `aiascent.dev` website. It organizes work by the group of files involved and estimates complexity (token count and cycle count) to aid in planning for AI-assisted development.\n\n## 2. How to Use\n\n(See M3. Interaction Schema or T17. Template - Universal Task Checklist.md for detailed usage instructions.)\n\n-----\n\n## Task List for Cycle 5+\n\n## T-5: Interactive Workflow Visualization (Cycle 5+)\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`\n\n  - **Total Tokens:** ~1,000\n\n  - **More than one cycle?** No\n\n  - **Status:** To Do\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 5.1):** Enhance `WorkflowSection.tsx` to be more interactive as per user feedback. This could involve using Framer Motion to animate the steps or highlight them on scroll.\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1.  Scroll to the Workflow section on the home page.\n2.  **Expected:** The workflow steps should have some form of animation or interactivity that makes the section more engaging.\n\n## T-6: Interactive Showcase Implementation (Cycle 5+)\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/components/showcase/InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx`\n        - `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`\n        - `src/data/whitepaperContent.json`\n\n  - **Total Tokens:** ~10,000+\n\n  - **More than one cycle?** Yes\n\n  - **Status:** To Do\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 6.1):** Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` layout based on the design in A17 (Introduction, Component, Meta-Commentary).\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 6.2):** Enhance the core logic and styling for the `InteractiveWhitepaper.tsx` component (e.g., adding a Table of Contents sidebar).\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 6.3):** (Curator Task) Populate `whitepaperContent.json` with actual content (the placeholder is currently minimal).\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1.  Navigate to `/showcase`.\n2.  **Expected:** The page layout should match A17. The interactive component should function correctly with the available data.\n\n## T-7: Plan for Next Cycle\n\n  - **Files Involved:**\n        - `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`\n\n  - [ ] **Task (T-ID: 7.1):** Review progress, update this checklist, and prioritize tasks for the subsequent cycle.\n\n-----\n\n## Completed Tasks\n\n## T-4: Homepage Polish and Bug Fixes (Cycle 4)\n- **Status:** Completed (C4)\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.1):** Add missing `@tsparticles` dependencies to `package.json`.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.2):** Add top padding to `HeroSection.tsx` to prevent content from being obscured by the fixed header.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.3):** Correct the `HeroSection.tsx` to display a single `pcp.gif` in the `ContainerScroll` instead of a split view.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.4):** Adjust component heights in `HeroSection` and `ContainerScroll` to reduce the large empty space.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.5):** Add bottom padding to the headline in `FeaturesSection.tsx` to fix text cutoff.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.6):** Update `FeaturesSection.tsx` to use the new `.png` icons instead of `.svg` placeholders.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.7):** Improve the visual styling of the static `WorkflowSection.tsx`.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 4.8):** Correct the `z-index` and implementation in `LampComponent.tsx` to ensure the sparkles effect appears behind the text content.\n\n## T-3: Home Page Implementation (Cycle 3)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C3)\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.1):** Implement the `HeroSection.tsx` component based on A16.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.2):** Implement the `FeaturesSection.tsx` component based on A16.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.3):** Implement the `WorkflowSection.tsx` component.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.4):** Implement the `MissionSection.tsx` component based on A16.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 3.5):** Integrate these new components into `src/app/page.tsx`.\n\n## T-2: Strategic Planning and Asset Management (Cycle 2)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C2)\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 2.1):** Create A15 (Asset Wishlist) and generate placeholder assets.\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 2.2):** Create page design artifacts (A16-A19).\n\n## T-1: Project Scaffolding (Cycle 1)\n\n  - **Status:** Completed (C1)\n  - [X] **Task (T-ID: 1.1):** Generate the initial Next.js project structure.\n</file_artifact>"

          "content": "<summary>\nI've analyzed the user's feedback and will implement the requested visual adjustments to the homepage. My course of action is to address the spacing in the hero section, enlarge the feature images, expand the particle effect in the mission section, improve text readability over the particles, and remove a visual artifact causing a black line.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will increase the vertical spacing between the headline/button group and the `ContainerScroll` component to prevent the animated card from overlapping the buttons. I'll achieve this by adding more bottom margin to the text container.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** To make the feature images more prominent, I will significantly increase their size within their respective cards. I will adjust the `width` and `height` of the `Image` component and modify the parent `CardBody` container to accommodate the larger visuals, making them roughly half the card's height.\n\n3.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** To address the particle effect issues, I will first modify the `LampContainer`.\n    *   I will increase the `min-h` property to make the entire section taller, allowing the particle effect to cover a larger area as requested.\n    *   To fix the horizontal black line, I've identified that one of the `div` elements creating the lamp's light beam effect has a hard edge. I will adjust its `translate-y` property to move it down slightly, ensuring it blends seamlessly into the background and eliminating the artifact.\n\n4.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To improve the readability of the text over the particle effect, I will adjust the gradient of the main headline. I will change the gradient colors from `from-neutral-300 to-neutral-500` to a brighter `from-white to-neutral-400` to create better contrast against the cyan glow of the lamp effect.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Adjust layout and visuals for better spacing\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-150px] md:mt-[-100px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow. <br /> Become a Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-lg md:text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

My course of action is to address the spacing in the Hero section, enlarge the images in the Features section, and expand and clean up the particle effect in the Mission section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Adjust Hero Section Spacing:** I will modify `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` to add more vertical space above the `ContainerScroll` component. This will prevent the scrolling card from overlapping the main headline and call-to-action buttons, providing a cleaner presentation. I will replace the temporary `<br/>` tags with a more robust padding solution.\n\n2.  **Enlarge Feature Images:** I will update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx` to significantly increase the size of the three feature images. I will adjust the `Image` component dimensions and the surrounding `CardItem` container to make the icons much more prominent, as requested.\n\n3.  **Refine Mission Section Particles:**\n    *   **Expand Particles:** I will modify `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`. I'll increase the size of the container for the `SparklesCore` component, making the particle effect span a much larger portion of the section background.\n    *   **Improve Text Readability:** In `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`, I will adjust the text gradient to be brighter, making it more legible against the dynamic background of the `LampComponent`.\n    *   **Remove Horizontal Line:** I will investigate the `motion.div` elements within `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`. The horizontal black line is likely an artifact caused by a hard edge between masking elements. I will adjust the positioning and add a blur effect to the masking div to create a seamless blend and eliminate the line.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Adjust layout and visuals for better spacing\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col w-full\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col pt-24 md:pt-32\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow.

My course of action is to address the spacing in the Hero section, enlarge the images in the Features section, and refine the particle effect and text readability in the Mission section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `HeroSection.tsx`:** I will add additional vertical spacing above the main headline to push the entire hero content block down, ensuring the `ContainerScroll` animation does not overlap with the call-to-action buttons in its initial state.\n\n2.  **Update `FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will significantly increase the size of the three feature images to make them more prominent, as requested. This involves increasing the `width` and `height` props on the `Image` components and adjusting their container dimensions to ensure they are displayed correctly without distortion. I will also increase the overall size of the cards to accommodate the larger images.\n\n3.  **Update `MissionSection.tsx` & `lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   To expand the particle effect, I will modify `lamp.tsx` to increase the height of the `LampContainer` and the dimensions of the `SparklesCore` component's wrapper, allowing the particles to fill the entire section.\n    *   To improve text readability, I will tone down the intensity of the cyan light effect in `lamp.tsx` by changing the colors from `cyan` to a more subtle `neutral` shade. This will increase the contrast between the background and the text.\n    *   To remove the horizontal black line observed by the user, I will remove the specific `motion.div` element in `lamp.tsx` that is responsible for rendering this line.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Add vertical spacing to prevent button overlap\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-150px] md:mt-[-100px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow.

My course of action is to increase spacing in the hero section, enlarge the feature images, and expand and refine the particle effect in the mission section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Adjust Hero Section Spacing:** I will modify `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` to add more vertical space between the main text/buttons and the animated `ContainerScroll` component, preventing the buttons from being obscured. I will also remove the temporary `<br>` tags from the title for a cleaner, CSS-based solution.\n2.  **Enlarge Feature Images:** I will update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx` to make the three feature images more prominent. This involves increasing the size of the image containers and the `Image` components themselves, as well as widening the parent cards to accommodate the new dimensions.\n3.  **Refine Mission Section Particles:**\n    *   I will edit `src/components/global/lamp.tsx` to expand the area where the particles are rendered by increasing the minimum height of the `LampContainer`.\n    *   To address the hard-to-read text in `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`, I will increase the text's contrast by making it a lighter color.\n    *   To fix the horizontal black line in the particle area, I will remove a specific overlay `div` within `lamp.tsx` that appears to be creating an unnatural hard edge, allowing the particle effect to blend more smoothly with the background.\n    *   I will also soften the harsh cyan light color in `lamp.tsx` to a more neutral tone to further improve text readability and align with the site's sophisticated aesthetic.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Adjust layout and visuals for spacing\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-50px] md:mt-0\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8 pt-16\">\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow.

My course of action is to address the spacing in the Hero section, enlarge the images in the Features section, and refine the particle effect and text readability in the Mission section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will add additional vertical spacing above the main headline to push the title and CTA buttons further down the page. This will prevent the `ContainerScroll` animation from overlapping with the buttons when it is in its upper position.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will significantly increase the size of the three feature images. This involves adjusting the height of the container `div` and increasing the `width` and `height` props of the Next.js `Image` component to make them more prominent, as requested.\n\n3.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To improve readability, I will adjust the text color gradient to be brighter and have more contrast against the dark, animated background.\n\n4.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will make several adjustments here to address the particle effect issues:\n    *   I will increase the `min-h` property of the `LampContainer` to expand the overall height of the section, giving the particle effect more space to render.\n    *   I will investigate the horizontal black line artifact. My primary suspect is an absolutely positioned `div` used to mask the top of the lamp effect. I will adjust its `translate-y` property to move it slightly higher, ensuring it no longer creates a visible edge within the particle field.\n    *   To further improve text readability, I will tone down the intensity of the cyan light effect by changing `cyan-500` to `cyan-600` and `cyan-400` to `cyan-500`, making the background less bright.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Add vertical spacing to prevent button overlap\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-150px] md:mt-[-100px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow.

My course of action is to refine the styling of the Hero, Features, and Mission sections to improve spacing, prominence, and readability, as well as to fix a visual artifact in the particle effect.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Adjust Hero Section Spacing:** I will edit `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` to add more vertical space above the main headline. This will prevent the scroll animation card from partially obscuring the call-to-action buttons when it's in its initial, larger state.\n\n2.  **Enlarge Feature Cards:** In `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`, I will significantly increase the size of the three feature cards and the images within them to make them more prominent, as requested. I will adjust the width and height constraints to make them a central visual element.\n\n3.  **Improve Mission Section Text:** To enhance readability against the particle background in `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`, I will adjust the text's gradient, making it brighter and increasing the contrast.\n\n4.  **Expand and Fix Particle Effect:** I will modify `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`. First, I'll increase the minimum height of the `LampContainer` to make the particle effect encompass a larger portion of the section. Second, I will apply a blur effect to a specific div that is likely causing the noticeable horizontal black line, which should soften the edge and blend it into the background.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Add more vertical spacing to prevent button overlap\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-150px] md:mt-[-100px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow.

This involves adjusting the container widths and the image dimensions to fill the larger space.\n3.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** To fix the Mission section's particle effect, I will expand the overall height of the `LampContainer`. I will also enlarge the container for the `SparklesCore` component to fill the entire section, ensuring the particles are not confined to a small area. Additionally, I will remove the specific `motion.div` that is rendering the unwanted horizontal line.\n4.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To improve the readability of the text against the particle background, I will adjust the text's gradient to use brighter colors, making it stand out more clearly.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C5 - Add more vertical spacing\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-150px] md:mt-[-100px]\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8\">\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow.

My course of action is to address the hero section spacing, increase the size of the feature images, and expand and refine the particle effect in the mission section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will add additional line breaks within the main `h1` title. This will increase the top padding of the entire hero text block, pushing the `ContainerScroll` animation further down the page to prevent it from overlapping the call-to-action buttons.\n2.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** To make the feature images more prominent as requested, I will significantly increase their container size from `h-24` to `h-72`. I will also update the `Image` component's props to a larger size (`300x300`) and ensure it uses `object-contain` to scale correctly within the new, larger area.\n3.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   To expand the particle effect to cover the entire section, I will change the `min-h-[600px]` on the `LampContainer` to `min-h-screen`, making it fill the viewport's height.\n    *   To remove the unwanted horizontal black line, I will delete the `motion.div` element that renders the thin \"filament\" of the lamp, as it appears to be the source of this visual artifact.\n    *   To improve the readability of the text over the particles, I will change the lamp's color from a bright `cyan-500` to a more subtle `neutral-500`, reducing the background glare.\n4.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** I will review the text styling to ensure it has sufficient contrast against the newly dimmed particle background in `lamp.tsx`. The existing gradient text should be more readable now.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C5 - Expand particle area, remove

My course of action is to address the sizing and spacing issues in the Hero, Features, and Mission sections to create a more polished and visually impactful presentation. I will expand the hero GIF to be more prominent, enlarge the feature images to showcase their detail, and refine the Mission section's sparkle effect to remove awkward spacing and visual artifacts.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will modify the layout to make the `pcp.gif` significantly larger, removing the restrictive container and allowing it to fill more of the available horizontal space. This will improve visibility of the details within the animation.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will redesign the layout to give the feature images much more prominence. By increasing the size of the cards and the images within them, the details of the artwork will become a central focus, making the section more visually appealing.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** I will adjust the styling to remove the large empty space below the \"More Than Code\" title, creating a more seamless transition to the footer.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will fine-tune the `LampContainer` component. This involves:\n    *   Removing the element causing a visual artifact behind the text.\n    *   Adjusting the vertical alignment to move the lamp's light beam to the top of the section, eliminating the awkward gap above the sparkles.\n    *   Expanding the sparkles effect to fill the entire background of the section.\n    *   Reducing the overall minimum height of the container to remove the large blank space before the footer.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C6 - Enlarge GIF display area\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-50px] md:mt-0\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8 pt-16\">\n            Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-lg md:text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the feedback and the annotated screenshots. My course of action is to address the layout and sizing issues in the Hero, Features, and Mission sections to create a more polished and visually impactful homepage. I will enlarge key visual elements, remove distracting backgrounds and spacing, and fix rendering artifacts.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will modify the `ContainerScroll` component to remove the restrictive `max-w-5xl` class on its inner card, allowing the `pcp.gif` to expand and fill more of the available horizontal space. I will also adjust the vertical margin to ensure there is adequate spacing between the hero text and the animated visual.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`:** I will remove the `bg-gray-100` class from the card's content area. This will eliminate the white box behind the `pcp.gif`, allowing it to blend seamlessly with the dark theme of the hero section.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** To make the feature images more prominent, I will significantly increase their size. I will adjust the layout by increasing the width of the cards and the height of the image containers, ensuring the feature visuals are large, detailed, and impactful.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will address all three issues in the Mission/Sparkles section:\n    *   To eliminate the empty space above the sparkles (Issue 1), I will wrap the `SparklesCore` component in an absolutely positioned div that fills the entire container.\n    *   To fix the strange rectangle artifact (Issue 2), I will remove the specific `div` that was creating an opaque background block behind the text.\n    *   To remove the large empty space below (Issue 3), I will reduce the `min-h` of the `LampContainer`, creating a much tighter and more cohesive layout leading into the footer.\n\n5.  **Update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:** To allow the sparkles from the Mission section to bleed into the footer for a more integrated look, I will make the footer's background transparent and remove the top border.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C6 - Enlarge hero visual and adjust spacing\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-50px] md:mt-0\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8 pt-16\">\n            Citizen Architect.\n          </h1>\n          \n          {/* Subheadline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <p className=\"text-lg md:text-xl text-neutral-400 max-w-4xl text-center mb-12\">\n            The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is the essential VS Code extension for developers who want to move beyond prompt-and-pray.

The white background will be removed.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will redesign the feature cards to make the images the primary focus. I will increase the overall card size and allocate more space to the images, making them larger and more impactful as requested.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** I will remove the large empty space below this section to create a more compact layout leading into the footer.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** This component is used by the Mission section. I will adjust its internal structure to fix the visual artifacts noted in the screenshot. Specifically, I will move the lamp's light beam higher, expand the sparkles to fill the entire background area, and remove the element causing the strange rectangle artifact.

This will remove the white box around the hero GIF, allowing it to blend seamlessly with the dark background of the hero section.\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Adjust the `Image` component for the `pcp.gif`. I will change `objectFit=\"contain\"` to `objectFit=\"cover\"` to ensure the GIF fills its container more effectively and appears larger and more detailed as requested.\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** To make the feature images more prominent, I will increase the overall size of the cards and the images within them. The card width will be increased, and the `Image` component's dimensions will be enlarged to make the visuals a more central focus of the section.\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   To fix the spacing issues, I will reduce the `min-h-[800px]` on the `LampContainer` to remove the large empty space below the component.\n    *   I will increase the height of the `SparklesCore` container and adjust its vertical positioning to fill the empty space above the text, creating a fuller particle effect.\n    *   The horizontal \"lamp line\" will be moved further up by adjusting its `translate-y` property.\n    *   I will investigate the blurred `motion.div` elements to find and eliminate the rectangular visual artifact behind the text.\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** I will remove the `mt-8` from the main heading to allow it to sit higher within the `LampContainer`, closer to the light source, improving the visual composition.\n6.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** I will remove the negative margin that pulls the `FeaturesSection` up, as this is contributing to some of the awkward spacing between sections.

I will increase the size of the cards and the images within them, ensuring the details of the artwork are clearly visible and impactful.\n3.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`**: Refactor the `LampContainer` component to address several issues.

My course of action is to address the sizing and presentation of the images in the Hero and Features sections, and to fix several layout and aesthetic issues in the Mission/Sparkles section to create a more polished and immersive user experience.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will modify the styling of the `ContainerScroll` component to remove the white background that is clashing with the dark theme. I will also adjust the component's height and the `Image` properties to make the `pcp.gif` significantly larger, allowing its details to be clearly visible and better utilizing the available screen space.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will restructure this section to give the feature images more prominence. I will change the layout of each feature card to be more vertical, placing a much larger image above the title and description, which will better showcase the visual details as requested.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will perform several fixes here to address the issues in the \"More Than Code\" section:\n    *   I will expand the `SparklesCore` component to fill the entire container, eliminating the empty space at the top.\n    *   I will remove a masking `div` that was creating an unwanted black bar at the top of the section.\n    *   I will remove a `div` that was causing the rectangular visual artifact behind the text.\n    *   I will adjust the overall height of the container to remove the large empty space below the content.\n    *   I will move the horizontal \"lamp line\" element higher up to improve the visual composition.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To allow the sparkles to extend behind the footer, I will add a negative bottom margin to this section, effectively pulling the footer up over the bottom of the sparkles effect.\n\n5.  **Update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:** I will make the footer's background transparent. This will allow the sparkles from the `MissionSection` to be visible behind it, creating the seamless, layered effect the user described.\n\n6.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** I will add a `relative` positioning and `overflow-hidden` class to the main page container.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the feedback from Cycle 6 and will implement a series of visual and layout enhancements to address the requested changes. My course of action focuses on increasing the size and impact of key visual elements, refining the layout of the \"Sparkles\" section to improve visual flow, and fixing a visual artifact.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`:** Modify the `Card` component to remove the white background that is incorrectly framing the hero section's GIF. I will change the `bg-gray-100` class to `bg-black` to match the site's dark theme. I will also remove the padding to allow the GIF to fill more of its container.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** To make the primary GIF larger and more detailed as requested, I will adjust the constraints on the `ContainerScroll` component, increasing its maximum width and modifying its height to create a more panoramic and impactful presentation.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will completely refactor this section's layout. Instead of the current three-column grid of small cards, I will implement a single-column, alternating layout. Each feature will be presented in a dedicated, full-width block with a large image on one side and the descriptive text on the other. This will dramatically increase the size and prominence of the feature images, making their details more visible and appealing.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will make several adjustments to fix the layout issues in the \"More Than Code\" section.\n    *   To address the empty space above the sparkles, I will adjust the vertical positioning of the lamp's light beam elements, moving them higher.\n    *   To eliminate the rectangular visual artifact, I will soften the blur effect on one of the underlying `div` elements that creates the lamp's glow.\n    *   I will also adjust the z-index to ensure the sparkles render correctly behind the main content.\n\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To remove the large empty space below the sparkles and create a seamless transition to the footer, I will reduce the minimum height of the `LampContainer`. Additionally, I will add a negative bottom margin to the section, allowing the sparkles effect to overlap with the footer as suggested.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx\n// C6 - Remove white background from card\n'use client'\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react'\nimport { useScroll, useTransform, motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\n// Define the type for the children prop, which will contain the visuals (images/gifs)\ntype ContainerScrollProps = {\ntitleComponent: string | React.ReactNode;\nchildren: React.ReactNode; // Added children prop\n};\n\nexport const ContainerScroll = ({\ntitleComponent,\nchildren, // Destructure children\n}: ContainerScrollProps) => {\nconst containerRef = useRef<any>(null)\nconst { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({\ntarget: containerRef,\n})\nconst [isMobile, setIsMobile] = React.useState(false)\n\nReact.useEffect(() => {\nconst checkMobile = () => {\nsetIsMobile(window.innerWidth <= 768)\n}\ncheckMobile()\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\nreturn () => {\nwindow.removeEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\n}\n}, [])\n\nconst scaleDimensions = () => {\nreturn isMobile ?

refining the visual presentation of the homepage based on your detailed feedback.\n\nFirst, I addressed the hero section by removing the distracting white background around the main GIF and expanding its container. This makes the `pcp.gif` significantly larger and more immersive, allowing the details of the DCE workflow to be clearly visible against the dark theme.\n\nNext, I completely redesigned the features section. I replaced the three small, side-by-side cards with a more dynamic, single-column layout. Each feature—\"Precision Context Curation,\" \"Parallel Co-Pilot,\" and \"Iterative Knowledge Graph\"—is now showcased in its own large-format, alternating block with a prominent image and descriptive text. This change gives the feature visuals the space and emphasis they need to be impactful.\n\nFinally, I made several adjustments to the \"More Than Code\" section at the bottom of the page. I resolved the layout issues by removing the empty space above and below the sparkles effect and repositioning the central \"lamp\" light for a better aesthetic. The strange rectangular visual artifact has been eliminated by softening the underlying blur effect. To create a more seamless and integrated feel, I also adjusted the layout so that the sparkles now extend down and overlap with the site's footer, as you suggested.\n\nThese changes collectively enhance the visual hierarchy, improve the aesthetic consistency of the homepage, and make the key visual elements more engaging for visitors."

My course of action is to address the sizing and background of the hero section's GIF, redesign the features section for greater visual impact, and fix the layout and graphical artifacts in the mission/sparkles section.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will modify the layout to allow the main `pcp.gif` to be significantly larger. The container will be expanded, and padding will be adjusted to give the visual more prominence and ensure details are readable.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`:** I will remove the white `bg-gray-100` from the inner card of the `ContainerScroll` component, making it transparent to blend seamlessly with the dark theme of the hero section. I will also increase the `max-width` of the card to accommodate the larger GIF.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** This section will be completely redesigned. I will replace the three-column card layout with a more dynamic, alternating layout.

My focus will be on enlarging the key visual elements, fixing layout spacing issues in the \"sparkles\" section, and removing visual artifacts.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will significantly enlarge the `pcp.gif` to improve visibility and impact. This involves removing the restrictive white background from the `Card` component within the `ContainerScroll` animation and adjusting the container's properties to allow the GIF to occupy more horizontal space, addressing the user's feedback about the small, unreadable visual.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** To make the feature visuals more prominent, I will refactor the layout. Instead of three small horizontal cards, I will arrange them in a way that allows each image to be much larger and more detailed, as requested. I will increase the size of the images within their cards to make them a central focus.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** I will eliminate the large empty space below the \"More Than Code\" title by removing the `min-h-[800px]` property from the `LampContainer`, allowing the section to fit its content more snugly against the footer.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will address the three specific issues in this component:\n    *   I will move the horizontal \"lamp line\" element higher to the top of the container.\n    *   I will remove the strange rectangular visual artifact by adjusting the background properties of one of the blur/backdrop layers.\n    *   I will expand the `SparklesCore` component to fill the entire container, ensuring sparkles reach the top and bottom edges to create a more seamless and immersive effect, removing the empty space above.\n\n5.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** I will adjust the margin between the `HeroSection` and `FeaturesSection` to account for the layout changes and ensure a visually pleasing flow between sections.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/page.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/app/page.tsx\n// C6 -

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the user's feedback from the screenshots and will implement the requested visual improvements. My course of action is to make the `pcp.gif` and feature images larger and more prominent, and to fix the layout and visual artifacts in the \"More Than Code\" section with the sparkles effect.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Modify the `ContainerScroll`'s child `div` to remove the light background, allowing the dark theme to show through. I will also adjust the styling to make the `pcp.gif` significantly larger, filling more of the available screen space as requested, to make its details more visible.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** I will refactor this section's layout to give the feature images much more prominence. Instead of three small cards side-by-side, I will change the layout to a more focused presentation where each feature's image is displayed in a larger format, making the details clear and impactful. I will stack them vertically with more emphasis on the visual component.\n\n3.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To address the spacing issues, I will remove the `min-h-[800px]` from the `LampContainer` and adjust the padding.

My course of action is to address the four specific problems identified in the marked-up screenshot: the cut-off title, the rectangular visual artifacts, the excessive empty space above the footer, and the incorrect positioning of the footer text. I will modify the styling in the `MissionSection`, `LampContainer`, and `Footer` components to resolve these layout and aesthetic issues.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Fix Footer Layout (`Footer.tsx`):** I will modify the flexbox properties of the main container in `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`. By changing `justify-between` and adjusting padding, I will push the \"Built using...\" text to the bottom-left and the copyright text to the bottom-right, aligning them with the corners as requested.\n\n2.  **Adjust Mission Section Content Position (`MissionSection.tsx`):** To fix the cut-off title (\"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM\"), I will adjust the vertical positioning of the content within the `LampContainer`. The negative translation (`-translate-y-80`) applied to the main content `div` is too aggressive. I will reduce this value to pull the text down, ensuring the title is fully visible below the lamp's light beam.\n\n3.  **Refine Lamp Component and Reduce Space (`lamp.tsx`):**\n    *   **Remove Artifacts:** The rectangular artifacts are caused by a specific `div` with a `blur-2xl` class that creates a hard-edged background effect. I will remove this element to allow the particle background to show through cleanly.\n    *   **Reduce Empty Space:** The excessive vertical space is caused by a large `min-h` and bottom padding (`pb-40`) on the `LampContainer`.

The problems include a cut-off title, visual artifacts in the background effect, excessive empty space, and misaligned footer text.\n\nMy course of action is to address these layout and styling issues by modifying the `MissionSection`, the `lamp` component it uses, and the `Footer` component to create a more polished and visually cohesive final section for the page.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   To fix the cut-off title, I will adjust the vertical translation (`translate-y`) of the main content area, moving it down to be fully visible below the lamp's light source.\n    *   To eliminate the rectangular visual artifacts, I will remove a specific `div` that was creating a hard-edged blur effect, allowing the background to be composed purely of the smoother gradients and the sparkle effect.\n    *   To make the sparkle effect more expansive and eliminate the \"weird rectangle effects\" pointed out, I will ensure the `SparklesCore` component fills the entire background of the `LampContainer`.\n    *   I will also reduce the bottom padding of the `LampContainer` to help eliminate the extra vertical space.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   I will remove the negative margin that was previously used to pull the footer up. The spacing issue will now be resolved by the reduced padding in the `LampContainer` itself, creating a cleaner layout.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:**\n    *   To fix the positioning, I will refactor the footer's internal structure. I will replace the centered `container` div with a full-width flexbox container.\n    *   I will set this container to `justify-between` to push the two text elements to the far left and right edges.\n    *   Finally, I will add horizontal padding directly to the `div` to give the text some space from the absolute corners of the viewport, achieving the desired corner-aligned appearance.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 - Adjust layout to fix title cutoff and remove visual artifacts\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C7: Reduced bottom padding significantly to remove empty space\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20 pb-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      {/* C7: Ensure sparkles fill the entire container background */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-125 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-56 overflow-visible w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-56 w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        {/* C7: This div creates a soft backdrop blur without hard edges */}\n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-10 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        \n        {/* C7: This div creates the soft glow effect */}\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        \n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[18rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-60 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}```\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C7 - Remove negative margin\n'use client';

This involves adjusting the flexbox properties and container structure for better control.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 - Adjust layout to fix title cutoff, artifacts, and spacing\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C7: Reduced bottom padding from pb-40 to pb-20 to decrease space\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20 pb-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      {/* Sparkles now fill the entire container */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-125 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-56 overflow-visible w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-56 w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        {/* C7: Removed the div causing the rectangular blur artifact */}\n        {/* <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div> */}\n\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[18rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n\n        {/* C7: Removed the div that created the top black bar/artifact */}\n        {/* <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-40 h-44 w-full -translate-y-[12.5rem] bg-neutral-950 \"></div> */}\n      </div>\n\n      {/* C7: Reduced upward translation from -translate-y-80 to -translate-y-64 to move content down */}\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-64 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C7 - Remove negative margin\n'use client';

My course of action is to address the cut-off title, visual artifacts, excessive spacing, and incorrect footer positioning.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Fix Cut-Off Title & Reduce Space:** I will modify `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`. I'll add significant top padding to the content to push the title down, preventing it from being clipped by the lamp effect's container. Simultaneously, I will increase the negative bottom margin substantially to pull the footer up and eliminate the large empty space between the sections.\n2.  **Fix Visual Artifacts:** I will update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`. The rectangular artifacts are likely caused by the container being too small for the visual effects to blend properly. I will increase the overall vertical padding of the `LampContainer` to give the sparkles and light effects more room to render, which should soften the hard edges causing the artifacts. I will also adjust the lamp's \"line\" to be positioned correctly within this new, larger space.\n3.  **Reposition Footer Text:** I will refactor `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`. The current implementation centers the content block. I will modify the structure to make the footer span the full width of the viewport, with an inner container that uses `justify-between` to push the \"Built using...\" text to the left and the \"© 2025...\" text to the right, achieving the desired corner-aligned appearance on larger screens.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">```typescript\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C7 - Adjust padding and margin to fix layout issues\n'use client'; // LampContainer requires client-side rendering\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { LampContainer } from '@/components/global/lamp';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion';\n\nconst MissionSection = () => {\nreturn (\n// C7: Increased negative bottom margin significantly to reduce space above footer\n<section className=\"w-full -mb-80\">\n<LampContainer>\n<motion.div\ninitial={{ opacity: 0.5, y: 100 }}\nwhileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}\ntransition={{\ndelay: 0.3,\nduration: 0.8,\nease: 'easeInOut',\n}}\n// C7: Added significant top padding to push content down and prevent title cutoff\nclassName=\"flex flex-col items-center text-center pt-24\"\n>\n<h2 className=\"mt-8 bg-gradient-to-br from-neutral-300 to-neutral-500 py-4 bg-clip-text text-center text-4xl font-medium tracking-tight text-transparent md:text-6xl uppercase\">\nThe Rise of Cognitive Capitalism.\n</h2>\n<p className=\"text-xl text-neutral-200 max-w-3xl text-center my-8\">\nMastering AI collaboration is essential for competitiveness and individual empowerment.

I will change the main container to use Flexbox with `justify-between`, pushing the \"Built using...\" text to the left and the copyright notice to the right.\n    *   I will also adjust the padding and remove unnecessary container `divs` to ensure the text sits cleanly in the bottom corners of the viewport.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 - Adjust content position, blur effects, and padding to fix visual bugs\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C7: Reduced bottom padding from pb-40 to pb-20 to decrease space above footer\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20 pb-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      {/* C6: Sparkles now fill the entire container */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-125 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-56 overflow-visible w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-56 w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        {/* C7: Increased size and blur to remove rectangular artifacts */}\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-48 w-[32rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          // C6: Moved lamp line much higher\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[18rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n\n      </div>\n\n      {/* C7: Changed from -translate-y-80 to -translate-y-72 to prevent title cutoff */}\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-72 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C7 - Remove negative margin\n'use client';

My course of action is to fix the cut-off title, remove visual artifacts, reduce empty space, and correctly position the footer content.\n\n1.  **Fix Mission Section Layout (`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`):**\n    *   To fix the cut-off title and reduce the large empty space, I will significantly decrease the vertical padding and minimum height of the `LampContainer`.\n    *   I will also adjust the vertical translation (`-translate-y-`) of the lamp's light source and motion elements, moving them higher to create more room for the title.\n    *   To eliminate the rectangular visual artifacts, I will remove the `div` elements that use large blur effects (`blur-2xl`, `blur-3xl`), as these are creating the unwanted shapes.\n    *   I will also expand the width of the conic gradient motion divs to ensure the light effect feels expansive and covers the area properly.\n\n2.  **Clean up `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   I will remove the negative margin (`-mb-40`) that was previously added. The layout adjustments in `lamp.tsx` provide a cleaner solution for managing the space between this section and the footer.\n\n3.  **Reposition Footer Content (`src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`):**\n    *   To align the footer text to the corners, I will restructure the component. Instead of a single centered container, I will use a full-width flex container with `justify-between`.\n    *   This will allow the two text blocks to be pushed to the left and right edges of the viewport, with appropriate padding to keep them from touching the absolute corners.\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   Reduce `min-h` and `pb` (padding-bottom) to decrease the overall height of the section.\n    *   Increase the negative `translate-y` values for the lamp's core elements to move the light source up and prevent it from obscuring the title.\n    *   Remove the `div`s with `blur-2xl` and `blur-3xl` classes that are causing the rectangular artifacts.\n    *   Widen the conic gradient `motion.div` elements to create a smoother, more expansive lighting effect.\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Remove the `className=\"-mb-40\"` from the `section` element to let the updated `LampContainer` manage the spacing naturally.\n3.  **Update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:**\n    *   Replace the main `div`'s `container` class with classes for a full-width flexbox layout (`w-full`, `flex`, `justify-between`, `items-center`, `px-8`).\n    *   Remove the now-unnecessary inner wrapper `div`.\n    *   Adjust the text alignment and padding on the child `p` tags to ensure they align correctly to the left and right.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 -

My course of action is to address the cut-off title, remove the rectangular visual artifacts, reduce the excessive empty space, and correctly position the footer elements. These changes primarily involve adjusting styles in the `MissionSection`, `LampContainer`, and `Footer` components.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Fix Cut-off Title and Rectangular Artifacts in `lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   The `LampContainer` is the source of the main visual problems. The cut-off title is due to the content being pushed too high (`-translate-y-80`). The rectangular artifacts are caused by background divs that don't cover the full container width.\n    *   I will modify `src/components/global/lamp.tsx` to expand its container to at least the full screen height (`min-h-screen`) to give content ample space.\n    *   I will adjust the vertical translation of the main content (`children`) to a smaller value, bringing the title fully into view.\n    *   I will remove the `scale-y-125` from an inner `div` that is distorting the background and contributing to the artifacts.\n    *   I will ensure the `SparklesCore` component is rendered with a higher `z-index` so it appears in front of the lamp's cone effects but behind the text content.\n\n2.  **Reduce Empty Space in `MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   The large gap between the mission content and the footer is caused by excessive vertical space in the `LampContainer`.\n    *   By adjusting the `LampContainer`'s layout and reducing the negative margin on the `MissionSection`, the large empty space will be eliminated, creating a more compact and visually appealing layout. I will remove the `-mb-40` class from the section.\n\n3.  **Reposition Footer Elements in `Footer.tsx`:**\n    *   The footer text is currently centered because it's inside a `container` div with `mx-auto`.\n    *   To position the text elements in the corners, I will refactor `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`. I will replace the single container `div` with a full-width `div` that uses Flexbox (`flex justify-between items-center`). This will push the \"Built using...\" text to the left and the copyright notice to the right, with padding to keep them from touching the absolute edges of the screen.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```typescript\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 - Adjust layout to fix cut-off title and visual artifacts\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C7: Changed to min-h-screen and adjusted padding\n        'relative flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 items-center justify-center isolate z-0 \">\n        {/* C7: Sparkles moved here with a z-index to be behind text but in front of cones */}\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-10\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-56 overflow-visible w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-56 w-[30rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 h-48 w-full translate-y-12 scale-x-150 bg-neutral-950 blur-2xl\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[7rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-40 h-44 w-full -translate-y-[12.5rem] bg-neutral-950 \"></div>\n      </div>\n\n      {/* C7: Reduced negative translation to bring content down */}\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-1/2 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n```typescript\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C7 - Remove negative margin\n'use client';

My course of action is to address the cut-off title, visual artifacts, excessive spacing, and incorrect footer alignment by making targeted adjustments to the Mission section, the Lamp component, and the Footer.\n\n1.  **Fix Cut-off Title and Spacing in Lamp Component:** I will edit `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`.\n    *   To prevent the title \"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM\" from being cut off, I will reduce the negative vertical translation on the main content container, moving it down into full view.\n    *   To eliminate the large empty space above the footer, I will significantly decrease the bottom padding of the `LampContainer`.\n\n2.  **Address Visual Artifacts:** In `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`, I will expand the vertical scale of the main light effect container. This will stretch the conical light gradient, aiming to cover the rectangular artifacts pointed out in the screenshot, creating a smoother visual.\n\n3.  **Adjust Mission Section Layout:** In `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`, I will adjust the negative bottom margin to compensate for the reduced padding in the `LampContainer`, ensuring the footer is positioned correctly without excessive overlap or spacing.\n\n4.  **Correct Footer Alignment:** I will refactor `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`.

My course of action is to address the layout and styling issues at the bottom of the homepage, focusing on the mission section and the footer. I will fix the cut-off title, remove the visual artifacts in the lamp effect, reduce the empty space above the footer, and correctly align the footer text to the corners.\n\n1.  **Fix Cut-off Title and Visual Artifacts:** I will modify `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`.\n    *   To fix the rectangular artifacts and give the lamp's light effect more room to blend smoothly, I will increase the minimum height of the `LampContainer` to fill the screen's height (`min-h-screen`).\n    *   To prevent the title from being cut off at the top, I will adjust the vertical positioning of the content within the `LampContainer`, bringing it down slightly.\n\n2.  **Reduce Empty Space Above Footer:** The large gap between the \"Read Our Mission\" button and the footer is caused by excessive bottom padding within the `LampContainer`. I will remove this large padding from `src/components/global/lamp.tsx` to shrink the empty space.\n\n3.  **Correct Footer Alignment:** I will update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` to achieve the desired corner-aligned layout. I will refactor the flexbox container to ensure it justifies its content to the space between, pushing the \"source code\" text to the left and the copyright text to the right on all screen sizes.\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   Increase the `LampContainer`'s minimum height to `min-h-screen` to expand the particle and lamp effect area, which will resolve the hard-edged rectangular artifacts.\n    *   Remove the large bottom padding (`pb-40`) to reduce the empty space below the content.\n    *   Adjust the vertical translation of the content wrapper from `-translate-y-80` to a smaller value like `-translate-y-72` to lower the content and prevent the title from being cut off.\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Remove the aggressive negative bottom margin (`-mb-40`) which is no longer necessary after adjusting the `LampContainer`'s height and padding.\n3.  **Update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:**\n    *   Simplify the flexbox layout within the footer's main container to `flex flex-row items-center justify-between`.\n    *   Remove the unnecessary wrapping `div` and responsive classes (`flex-col`, `md:flex-row`).\n    *   Ensure the two text elements are direct children of the container and have `text-left` and `text-center` (or `md:text-right`) alignment respectively, forcing them to opposite sides.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 -

I will adjust the vertical positioning of the content within the `LampContainer` component to ensure the title is fully visible. I will also remove a `scale-y-125` property that is likely distorting the lamp's light effect and causing the rectangular visual artifacts.\n2.  **Reduce Empty Space in `lamp.tsx` and `MissionSection.tsx`:** There is a large, unnecessary gap between the Mission section content and the footer. This is caused by excessive bottom padding in the `LampContainer` and a temporary negative margin on the `MissionSection`. I will reduce the padding within `lamp.tsx` and remove the negative margin from `MissionSection.tsx` for a cleaner layout that correctly closes the gap.\n3.  **Reposition Footer Content in `Footer.tsx`:** The footer text is currently centered due to being inside a `container` class. I will modify the footer's structure to span the full width of the viewport and use flexbox properties (`justify-between`) to push the two text elements to the far left and right corners, respectively, while maintaining appropriate padding.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C7 - Adjust vertical positioning to fix cut-off title and reduce empty space.

This will ensure their hard edges are rendered far outside the visible container area.\n    *   To fix the cut-off title, I will reduce the negative vertical translation on the content container, moving the children (including the title) down to give it more space at the top.\n    *   To reduce the large empty space above the footer, I will decrease the bottom padding of the main `LampContainer` div.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   I will remove the negative bottom margin that was pulling the footer up, as this was causing layout complications. Spacing will be managed within the `lamp` component and the page layout.\n    *   I will adjust the top margin of the main heading to ensure it has adequate spacing from the top of the lamp effect after the adjustments in `lamp.tsx`.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:**\n    *   To position the text elements in the bottom-left and bottom-right corners, I will refactor the main container within the footer.

My course of action is to make targeted adjustments to the `lamp.tsx` and `MissionSection.tsx` components to resolve the three outstanding visual issues in the bottom part of the site: the cut-off title, the rectangular lamp artifact, and the sliver of background below the sparkles.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Fix Cut-off Title (Purple Arrow):** I will modify `src/components/global/lamp.tsx` to push the content and the lamp effect further down from the top. I will increase the negative `translate-y` value for the main children container and adjust the vertical position of the lamp's light beam elements. This will create the necessary space to prevent the main header text in `MissionSection.tsx` from being clipped.\n\n2.  **Expand Lamp Effect (Yellow Arrows):** To eliminate the rectangular artifact and make the light feel more expansive, I will again edit `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`. I will significantly increase the `width` of the `motion.div` elements that create the conic gradients (e.g., from `50rem` to `80rem`). This will widen the light beam, making it a wash that covers the entire sparkle area and blends more naturally, removing the hard rectangular edges.\n\n3.  **Remove Bottom Sliver (Red Arrows):**\n    *   In `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`, I will remove the bottom padding (`pb-20`) from the main `LampContainer` `div`. This will allow the absolutely positioned `SparklesCore` component, which is set to fill its container, to extend all the way to the bottom edge.\n    *   In `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`, I will remove the negative bottom margin (`-mb-20`) to ensure there is no layout pull-up that could re-introduce a gap between the sparkles and the footer.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C8 - Final adjustments to fix title clipping, expand light wash, and remove bottom sliver.\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C8: Removed bottom padding (pb-20) to allow sparkles to reach the bottom edge.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the user's feedback and the provided screenshots from Cycle 8. My course of action is to make precise adjustments to the `LampContainer` component to resolve the three outstanding visual issues: the cut-off title, the rectangular light artifact, and the sliver of background at the bottom. I will also adjust the `MissionSection` and `Footer` to ensure a seamless transition at the bottom of the page.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** This file requires the most significant changes to fix all three issues.\n    *   **(Purple Arrow) Fix Cut-off Title:** I will adjust the vertical translation (`-translate-y-xx`) of the main content `div` and the lamp's horizontal line `div`. By moving the content further down and the line further up, I will create more space at the top, preventing the title from being clipped.\n    *   **(Yellow Arrows) Expand Lamp Effect:** To eliminate the rectangular light artifact, I will significantly increase the `width` of the two `motion.div` elements that create the conic gradients. Changing this from `50rem` to `80rem` will widen the light effect, making it span more of the container and fade more naturally, as requested.\n    *   **(Red Arrows) Remove Bottom Sliver:** I will remove the bottom padding (`pb-20`) from the main `LampContainer` div. This will allow the container and the absolutely positioned `SparklesCore` component within it to extend to the very bottom edge, eliminating the background sliver.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To fix the spacing issue between this section and the footer, I will remove the negative bottom margin (`-mb-20`). This will ensure the `MissionSection` doesn't pull the footer up, which was contributing to the layout problems.\n\n3.  **`src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`:** To address the feedback from the previous cycle about the footer text not being in the corners, I will adjust its styling. By removing fixed heights and vertical padding, the footer will become more compact, allowing the flexbox properties to push the text content to the far left and right corners more effectively.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C8 - Final adjustments to fix title clipping, expand light effect, and remove bottom sliver.\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C8: Removed all padding (pt-20, pb-20) to allow full bleed for sparkles.

          "content": "I have analyzed the visual feedback from the screenshots and will address the three outstanding issues in the bottom section of the homepage. My course of action is to modify the `lamp.tsx` component to fix the cut-off title, expand the lighting effect to remove artifacts, and ensure the sparkles extend to the very bottom of the container. I will also adjust the `MissionSection.tsx` to ensure it integrates correctly with the footer.\n\n1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** This is the primary file for all three fixes.\n    *   **(Issue #1: Cut-off Title)** To prevent the title from being cut off, I will adjust the vertical positioning of the content. I will change the `translate-y` value on the container for the `children`, moving it down from `-translate-y-60` to `-translate-y-40` to provide more space at the top.\n    *   **(Issue #2: Rectangular Artifact)** To eliminate the hard edges of the lamp's light effect and make it fill the sparkle area, I will significantly widen the conic gradient `motion.div` elements from `50rem` to `80rem`. This will push the light's edges beyond the visible container, creating a smoother, more expansive glow.\n    *   **(Issue #3: Bottom Sliver)** To remove the sliver of background below the sparkles, I will remove the bottom padding (`pb-20`) from the main `LampContainer` `div`. This will allow the absolutely positioned `SparklesCore` component to fill the entire height of the container, down to the very bottom edge.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To ensure the `LampContainer` properly meets the footer without any visual gaps or overlaps, I will remove the negative bottom margin (`-mb-20`). This will allow the `MissionSection` to occupy its full space, and the footer will follow naturally below it.\n\nThese changes will create a more polished and immersive final section for the homepage, resolving the specified visual bugs.\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```typescript\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C8 - Final visual adjustments to fix title cutoff, light artifacts, and bottom gap.\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C8: Removed bottom padding (pb-20) to fix gap above footer.\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      {/* Sparkles now fill the entire container */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-125 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          // C8: Increased width to '80rem' to eliminate side artifacts and expand the light.\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-56 overflow-visible w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          // C8: Increased width to '80rem' to eliminate side artifacts and expand the light.\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-56 w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[12rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-40 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n```typescript\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C8 - Removed negative margin to prevent overlap with footer.\n'use client';

My course of action is to make several adjustments to the `lamp.tsx` component and the `MissionSection.tsx` component to resolve the visual artifacts and layout issues in the bottom part of the homepage.\n\n1.  **Fix Header Cut-off (Purple Arrow):** In `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`, the content is being pulled up too high, causing the title to be clipped. I will reduce the negative vertical translation on the content wrapper to move it down and give it adequate space.\n\n2.  **Expand Lamp Effect (Yellow Arrows):** To eliminate the hard rectangular edges of the lamp's light effect, I will significantly increase the width and height of the conic gradient elements within `lamp.tsx`. This will make the light feel more expansive and blend more smoothly into the background, covering the same area as the particle effect as requested.\n\n3.  **Remove Bottom Sliver (Red Arrows):** The sliver of background at the bottom is caused by padding inside the `LampContainer` combined with a negative margin on the `MissionSection`. I will remove the bottom padding from `lamp.tsx` and the corresponding negative margin from `MissionSection.tsx`. This will ensure the particle effect extends to the very bottom of the component, flush with the footer.\n\nThese changes should create a cleaner, more immersive, and polished final section for the homepage.\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   Reduce the `-translate-y-60` on the main content `div` to a smaller value like `-translate-y-48` to prevent the title from being cut off.\n    *   Increase the width of the conic gradient `motion.div` elements from `w-[50rem]` to `w-[80rem]` to widen the light effect.\n    *   Increase the height of the conic gradient `motion.div` elements from `h-56` to `h-96` to make the light cone taller and soften its top edge.\n    *   Remove the `pb-20` class from the main container to eliminate the bottom padding that creates the background sliver.\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Remove the `-mb-20` class from the `section` element to align it correctly with the modified `LampContainer` and the footer.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C8 -

This, combined with the removal of the lamp's bottom padding, will allow the `LampContainer` to sit flush against the footer, ensuring the sparkles effect extends to the very bottom of the page without any sliver of background showing through.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C8 - Adjust layout to fix cut-off title, remove artifacts, and eliminate bottom sliver\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C8: Removed bottom padding (pb-20) to eliminate gap\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      {/* Sparkles now fill the entire container */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-125 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          // C8: Increased width to '80rem' to eliminate side artifacts\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-56 overflow-visible w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          // C8: Increased width to '80rem' to eliminate side artifacts\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-56 w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[12rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-52 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C8 - Remove negative margin to fix bottom sliver\n'use client';

My course of action is to address the three visual issues in the bottom \"Mission\" section of the site by adjusting the positioning of the content, expanding the lamp's light effect, and ensuring the sparkles extend to the very bottom of the page without any visible gap.\n\n1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   To fix the title being cut off at the top, I will adjust the vertical positioning of the content within the `LampContainer`. I will change the `-translate-y-60` class on the `div` wrapping the `children` to `-translate-y-52`, which moves the content down and provides more clearance from the elements above.\n    *   To address the rectangular artifacts from the lamp effect, I will expand the conic gradients to fill the entire horizontal space. I will modify the `whileInView` animation for both `motion.div` elements responsible for the light, changing the target `width` from `'50rem'` to `'100vw'`.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   To eliminate the small sliver of background visible between the sparkles and the footer, I will increase the overlap between the `MissionSection` and the `Footer`. I will change the negative bottom margin on the section from `-mb-20` to `-mb-24`, pulling the footer up slightly more to cover the gap.\n    *   To better align the visual hierarchy with the provided screenshot, I will remove the large `h2` element (\"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM.\") and make the main paragraph the focal point by increasing its font size.\n\nThese changes should resolve all the noted issues and create a more polished final section for the homepage.\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   Modify the `div` wrapping the `children` to have a class of `-translate-y-52` instead of `-translate-y-60` to prevent the title from being cut off.\n    *   Update the two conic gradient `motion.div` elements to animate their `width` to `'100vw'` in the `whileInView` prop to eliminate the rectangular light artifact.\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Change the section's class from `w-full -mb-20` to `w-full -mb-24` to increase the overlap with the footer and hide the background sliver.\n    *   Remove the `h2` element containing \"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM.\".\n    *   Increase the prominence of the main `p` element by adjusting its text size classes to `text-2xl md:text-3xl` and modifying its margins.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C8 -

My course of action is to make targeted adjustments to the `lamp.tsx` component to resolve the cut-off title, the rectangular lighting artifacts, and the gap at the bottom of the sparkles effect. I will also adjust the `MissionSection.tsx` to ensure it integrates seamlessly with these changes.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Header Cut Off (Purple):** I will adjust the vertical positioning of the content within the `LampContainer`. The `div` containing the `children` has a negative `translate-y` value that is too aggressive. I will reduce this value (e.g., from `-translate-y-60` to `-translate-y-40`) to move the content down, providing more space at the top and preventing the title from being clipped.\n    *   **Fix Rectangular Artifact (Yellow):** To eliminate the hard edges of the light cone effect, I will significantly increase the width of the `motion.div` elements that create the conic gradients. By changing their width from `w-[50rem]` to a much larger `w-[80rem]`, the light will appear to spread more naturally across the entire section, covering the area where the sparkles are visible.\n    *   **Fix Bottom Sliver (Red):** The gap at the bottom is caused by padding on the main `LampContainer`. I will remove the `pb-20` (bottom padding) from the container and ensure the absolutely positioned `SparklesCore` component fills the entire height of its parent, extending the effect to the very bottom edge.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   To compensate for the padding removal in the `LampContainer`, I will adjust the negative bottom margin on the `<section>` element. This will ensure there is no large, unwanted gap or overlap between the mission section and the footer, maintaining a clean layout.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C8 - Adjust layout to fix cut-off title, artifacts, and bottom sliver\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C8: Removed bottom padding (pb-20) to allow sparkles to reach the bottom.

          "content": "I have analyzed the user's feedback and identified the root causes for the three visual issues in the mission section at the bottom of the page. My course of action is to make targeted adjustments to the `lamp.tsx` component to resolve all three problems simultaneously, improving the visual presentation and eliminating the reported artifacts.\n\n### Course of Action\n\n1.  **Fix Cut-Off Title (Purple Arrow):** The main content within the `LampContainer` is being translated upwards too aggressively, causing the title to be clipped by the container's `overflow-hidden` property. I will reduce the negative vertical translation in `src/components/global/lamp.tsx` to ensure the title has enough space at the top and is fully visible.\n\n2.  **Expand Lamp Effect & Remove Artifact (Yellow Arrows):** The rectangular artifacts from the lamp's conic gradient are visible because the light effect is not wide enough to cover the entire component on larger screens. I will increase the width of the gradient effect within `src/components/global/lamp.tsx` to ensure it spans the full width of the container, creating a seamless lighting effect that matches the expanse of the particle background.\n\n3.  **Eliminate Bottom Sliver (Red Arrows):** The small sliver of background appearing below the particle effect is due to a minor gap between the `LampContainer` and the footer. To fix this, I will remove the `overflow-hidden` property from the `LampContainer` and slightly increase the height of the `SparklesCore` particle container within it. This will allow the particle effect to bleed down just enough to cover the gap, ensuring the sparkles extend to the very bottom of the section as requested.\n\nThese targeted changes within a single component will address all the user's concerns, resulting in a more polished and visually coherent mission section.\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C8 - Adjust layout to fix cut-off title, remove artifacts, and eliminate bottom sliver\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C8: Removed overflow-hidden to allow sparkles to bleed to the bottom\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20 pb-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      {/* C8: Sparkles container height increased to 101% to cover bottom sliver */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-[101%] z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-125 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          // C8: Increased width to '80rem' to eliminate side artifacts\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-56 overflow-visible w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          // C8: Increased width to '80rem' to eliminate side artifacts\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-56 w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[12rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n      </div>\n\n      {/* C8: Reduced negative translation from -y-60 to -y-52 to prevent title cutoff */}\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-52 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}```\n</file>"

This will make the light source much larger and more diffuse, allowing it to blend smoothly into the background instead of creating hard edges.\n    *   **(Bottom Sliver):** To remove the sliver of background below the sparkles, I will remove the bottom padding from the main `LampContainer` `div`. This will ensure the container, and the absolutely positioned sparkles within it, extend to the very bottom edge.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** To complement the change in `lamp.tsx` and create a cleaner layout, I will remove the negative bottom margin from the `<section>` element.

The two remaining issues are that the lamp's lighting effect does not extend far enough vertically, and the main title in that section is still partially cut off at the top.\n\nMy course of action is to make two targeted adjustments within the `src/components/global/lamp.tsx` file to resolve these final visual bugs.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   To make the title \"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM\" fully visible, I will further reduce the upward translation of the content container. I will change the `-translate-y-40` class to a smaller value, `-translate-y-32`, which will shift the entire text block down and bring the title completely into view.\n    *   To expand the lamp's lighting effect downwards to match the vertical space of the sparkles, I will adjust the properties of the large blurred `div` that creates the bottom fade effect. I will increase its height from `h-48` to `h-96` and move it further down by changing its vertical translation from `translate-y-12` to `translate-y-32`. This will extend the dark, faded area, ensuring the lamp effect covers the entire particle background as requested.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C9 - Final adjustments to lamp vertical size and title position\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      {/* Sparkles now fill the entire container */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-125 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-56 overflow-visible w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-56 w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        {/* C9: Increased height and downward translation to extend the lamp effect vertically */}\n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 h-96 w-full translate-y-32 scale-x-150 bg-neutral-950 blur-2xl\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[12rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n      </div>\n\n      {/* C9: Reduced upward translation from -translate-y-40 to -translate-y-32 to make title visible */}\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-32 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n</file_artifact>"

My course of action is to make final adjustments to the `lamp.tsx` component to resolve the two outstanding visual issues: the partially obscured title and the vertical span of the lamp effect.\n\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Obscured Title:** To ensure the \"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM\" title is fully visible, I will reduce the upward translation of the content container. The `div` that wraps the `children` prop has a `-translate-y-40` class. I will change this to `-translate-y-32`, which will shift the entire content block down, bringing the title clearly into view.\n    *   **Expand Lamp Effect:** To make the lamp's lighting effect extend vertically to encompass the entire area covered by the sparkles, I will increase the height of the `LampContainer` and the blur effect layers within it.\n        *   I will add a `min-h-[90vh]` class to the main `LampContainer` `div`. This gives the component sufficient vertical space, allowing the sparkles (which are set to `h-full`) to extend all the way to the footer.\n        *   I will increase the height of the primary horizontal blur effect `div`s from `h-48` to `h-96` and the secondary blur `div` from `h-36` to `h-72`. This will make the central light glow taller and softer, ensuring it fills the new, larger container vertically and matches the area of the particle effect as requested.\n\nThese targeted changes should perfect the visual appearance of the mission section, resolving the final issues noted.\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```typescript\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C9 - Final adjustments to fix title visibility and expand lamp effect vertically\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        // C9: Added min-h-[90vh] to ensure the container is tall enough for the sparkles and light effect to reach the bottom.\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20 min-h-[90vh]',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      {/* Sparkles now fill the entire container */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-125 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-56 overflow-visible w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-56 w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        {/* C9: Increased height of blur effects to expand the light vertically */}\n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 h-96 w-full translate-y-12 scale-x-150 bg-neutral-950 blur-2xl\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-96 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-72 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-72 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[12rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n      </div>\n\n      {/* C9: Reduced negative translation from -translate-y-40 to -translate-y-32 to move content down */}\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-32 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}```\n</file_artifact>"

This ensures the container and its child `SparklesCore` component are tall enough to match the desired layout indicated by the user's screenshot.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   To fix the partially obscured title, I will reduce the upward vertical translation of the content container from `-translate-y-40` to `-translate-y-32`. This will shift the title and \"Read Our Mission\" button down, bringing them fully into view.\n    *   To expand the lamp's lighting effect downwards, I will increase the height of the main background blur element.

Address the `next/image` legacy prop warnings by updating the `Image` components in `HeroSection.tsx` and `FeaturesSection.tsx` to use the modern `fill` prop and associated class names.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   **Expand Vertical Coverage:** I will increase the vertical scaling of the main light cone `div` from `scale-y-150` to `scale-y-200`. This will stretch the conic gradient effect downwards, ensuring it fully encompasses the particle effect area and eliminates the gap at the bottom.\n    *   **Reduce Luminosity:** To address the \"light pollution,\" I will make two adjustments. First, I will reduce the opacity of the main circular blur effect from `opacity-50` to `opacity-40`. Second, I will darken the light source in the conic gradients by changing them from `from-neutral-500` to `from-neutral-600`.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Apply Title Style:** I will update the `className` of the `h2` title. The current `bg-gradient-to-br from-neutral-300 to-neutral-500` will be replaced with `bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600` to match the styling of \"The Power of Iteration\" title, as requested.\n\n3.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Legacy Image Props:** I will update the `Image` component used for `pcp.gif`. I will remove the deprecated `layout=\"fill\"` and `objectFit=\"cover\"` props. I will replace them by adding the `fill` prop and adding the `object-cover` utility class to the `className`.\n\n4.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Legacy Image Props:** Similarly, I will update the `Image` component used for the feature icons.

          "content": "I have analyzed the user's feedback and identified four key areas for improvement. My course of action will address the visual styling of the Mission section, including the lamp effect and title, and resolve technical warnings related to legacy Next.js Image component properties.\n\n1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   **Expand Lamp Effect:** To ensure the lamp's light cone covers the entire vertical area of the sparkles, I will increase the vertical scaling of the gradient container. I will change the `scale-y-150` class to `scale-y-200`, which will stretch the effect downwards and eliminate the gap at the bottom.\n    *   **Reduce Light Intensity:** To address the \"light pollution,\" I will darken the colors that create the lamp effect. I will change the conic gradient's color from `from-neutral-500` to a darker `from-neutral-600`. Additionally, I will adjust the blur effect layers, changing `bg-neutral-500` to `bg-neutral-700` (with opacity reduced to `opacity-40`) and `bg-neutral-400` to `bg-neutral-500` to decrease overall brightness. The horizontal \"lamp line\" will also be toned down from `bg-neutral-400` to `bg-neutral-500`.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Apply Title Gradient:** To match the styling of other section headers, I will update the title \"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM.\" I will replace the existing `bg-gradient-to-br from-neutral-300 to-neutral-500` classes with `bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600`. I will also change the font weight from `font-medium` to `font-bold` for consistency.\n\n3.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Update Image Component:** To resolve the legacy prop warnings, I will update the `<Image>` component used for the `pcp.gif`. I will replace the deprecated `layout=\"fill\"` and `objectFit=\"cover\"` props with the modern equivalent: the `fill` boolean prop and the `object-cover` utility class.\n\n4.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Update Image Component:** Similarly, I will update the `<Image>` components for the feature icons.

          "content": "<course_of_action>\nI have analyzed the user's feedback and will address the four outstanding issues: the lamp effect's vertical coverage, its overall brightness, the styling of the mission section title, and the legacy Next.js Image component warnings.\n\n1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Vertical Coverage:** To ensure the lamp's light cone covers the entire vertical area of the sparkles, I will increase the height of the two `motion.div` elements that create the conic gradients. I will change their height from `h-96` to `h-[50rem]`. This will extend the light effect downwards, eliminating the gap at the bottom.\n    *   **Reduce Luminosity:** To decrease the overall brightness and \"light pollution,\" I will adjust the colors and opacities of the light-emitting elements. I will change `from-neutral-500` to a darker `from-neutral-600` in the conic gradients, reduce the opacity of the main blur effect from `opacity-50` to `opacity-40`, and use darker shades (`neutral-600` and `neutral-500`) for the blur and line elements.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Apply Title Gradient:** To match the style of other section headers, I will update the `<h2>` for \"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM.\" I will replace the existing gradient and font styling with `font-bold bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600`, ensuring a consistent look and feel.\n\n3.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Legacy Image Props:** To resolve the `npm run dev` warnings, I will update the `<Image>` component used for `pcp.gif`. I will replace the legacy `layout=\"fill\"` prop with the boolean `fill` prop and convert the `objectFit=\"cover\"` prop into a `className=\"object-cover\"`.\n\n4.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Legacy Image Props:** Similarly, I will update the `<Image>` component used for the feature icons. I will replace `layout=\"fill\"` with the `fill` prop and add `object-cover` to its `className` to handle the `objectFit` functionality, resolving the console warnings.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<summary>\nI will address the final visual polish issues on the homepage. My plan is to extend the lamp effect in the Mission section to cover all the sparkles and reduce its overall brightness for a more subtle look. I will also apply the consistent gradient text style to the Mission section's title.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the user's feedback from Cycle 10. My course of action is to address the final visual polish issues in the Mission section and resolve the legacy `next/image` warnings.\n\n1.  **Expand Lamp Effect:** I will increase the height of the conic gradient elements within `lamp.tsx` to ensure the light effect extends to the bottom of the section, fully encompassing the particle effect as requested.\n2.  **Reduce Lamp Luminosity:** To counteract the increased \"light pollution\" from the expanded effect, I will dim the lamp by adjusting the colors and opacity of its constituent layers, making the effect more subtle.\n3.  **Stylize Mission Title:** I will update the `MissionSection.tsx` title, \"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM,\" to use the same text gradient style as other section headers for visual consistency.\n4.  **Fix Image Prop Warnings:** I will refactor the `<Image>` components in `HeroSection.tsx` and `FeaturesSection.tsx` to use the modern Next.js props, replacing the deprecated `layout` and `objectFit` attributes to eliminate the warnings during development.\n\nThis will finalize the visual design of the homepage and clean up the developer console notifications.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   **Expand Lamp Coverage:** I will increase the height of the two main `motion.div` elements responsible for the conic gradient from `h-96` to `h-[60rem]`. This will stretch the light cone vertically to cover the entire particle effect area, resolving the gap at the bottom.\n    *   **Reduce Luminosity:** To dim the overall effect, I will change the gradient color from `from-neutral-500` to a darker `from-neutral-700`. I will also reduce the main light orb's intensity by changing its classes from `bg-neutral-500 opacity-50` to `bg-neutral-600 opacity-40`.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Apply Title Gradient:** I will modify the `className` of the `h2` title. I will replace the existing gradient (`bg-gradient-to-br from-neutral-300 to-neutral-500`) with the site-wide standard (`bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600`) and add the `font-bold` class to match other section titles.\n\n3.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Update Image Component:** I will refactor the `<Image>` component used for `pcp.gif`. I will remove the legacy `layout=\"fill\"` and `objectFit=\"cover\"` props. I will replace them with the boolean `fill` prop and add the `object-cover` utility class to the `className` string.\n\n4.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Update Image Component:** I will perform the same refactor on the `<Image>` component within the `.map()` loop.

My course of action will cover the lamp effect's coverage and luminosity, the title styling, and updating legacy image properties across the homepage.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   To fix the gap where the lamp effect does not cover the sparkles (the green bracket), I will significantly increase the height of the two `motion.div` elements that generate the conic gradients. I will change their height from `h-96` to `h-[50rem]`, ensuring the light effect extends to the very bottom of the container.\n    *   To address the increased \"light pollution,\" I will reduce the lamp's luminosity. I will achieve this by lowering the opacity of the main circular blur effect from `opacity-50` to `opacity-30` and using darker neutral colors (`bg-neutral-600` and `bg-neutral-500`) for the light sources.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   To apply the desired gradient style to \"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM,\" I will update its CSS classes. I will replace the current gradient (`from-neutral-300 to-neutral-500`) with the one used on other titles (`from-white to-neutral-600`) and change the font weight from `font-medium` to `font-bold` for consistency.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**\n    *   To resolve the legacy `Image` prop warnings for `pcp.gif`, I will refactor the `<Image>` component. I will replace the `layout=\"fill\"` prop with the boolean `fill` prop, remove the `objectFit=\"cover\"` prop, and add the `object-cover` utility class to its `className`.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   To resolve the legacy `Image` prop warnings for the feature icons, I will apply the same refactoring to the `<Image>` component inside the feature mapping. I will replace `layout=\"fill\"` with `fill`, remove `objectFit=\"cover\"`, and add the `object-cover` class.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C10 - Expand lamp effect vertically and reduce luminosity\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      {/* Sparkles now fill the entire container */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-150 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-[50rem] overflow-visible w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-600 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-[50rem] w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-600 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-600 opacity-30 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-500 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[12rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-20 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n</file>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C10 - Apply consistent gradient styling to the title\n'use client';

My course of action is to adjust the lamp and sparkles effect for better coverage and reduced brightness, apply the correct gradient style to the Mission section title, and update the legacy Image component props across the site to resolve the warnings.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   **Expand Sparkles Coverage (Green/Red Bracket):** To ensure the lamp and sparkles effect covers the entire vertical space as intended, I will modify the container div for the `SparklesCore` component. I will remove the fixed height and width (`w-[40rem] h-40`) and change its positioning to `absolute inset-0`, making it fill the entire `LampContainer`.\n    *   **Reduce Light Pollution:** To decrease the overall brightness of the lamp effect, I will reduce the opacity of the main blur element from `opacity-50` to `opacity-40`. This will soften the light without losing the effect.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Apply Title Gradient:** To match the styling of other section headers, I will replace the existing gradient classes on the \"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM.\" title with the ones used elsewhere (`bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600`).\n\n3.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Image Legacy Props:** I will update the `Image` component used for `pcp.gif`. I will replace the deprecated `layout=\"fill\"` and `objectFit=\"cover\"` props with the modern equivalent: the `fill` boolean prop and the `className=\"object-cover\"` utility.\n\n4.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Image Legacy Props:** Similarly, I will update the three `Image` components for the feature icons, replacing `layout=\"fill\"` and `objectFit=\"cover\"` with the `fill` prop and `className=\"object-cover\"` to resolve the terminal warnings.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C10 - Expand sparkles to fill container and reduce lamp brightness\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles'\n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-150 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-96 overflow-visible w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-500 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-96 w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-500 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        {/* C10: Reduced opacity from 50 to 40 to decrease brightness */}\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-40 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[12rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n\n        {/* C10: Changed div to be absolute and fill container to expand sparkles effect */}\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-20 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C10 - Apply correct gradient styling to title\n'use client';

My course of action involves adjusting the lamp effect's dimensions and luminosity, applying the correct gradient style to the Mission section title, and updating the Image components across the site to use modern properties.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   **Expand Lamp Effect Vertically:** To ensure the lamp's light cone covers the entire vertical space occupied by the sparkles, I will increase the height of the two `motion.div` elements that create the conic gradients from `h-96` to a larger value like `h-[45rem]`. This will extend the light effect downwards, eliminating the gap at the bottom.\n    *   **Reduce Luminosity:** To address the increased \"light pollution,\" I will make the light source less intense. I will change the gradient color from `from-neutral-500` to a darker `from-neutral-700`, which will reduce the overall brightness and spread of the light, creating a more subtle effect.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Apply Title Gradient:** To match the style of other section headers, I will update the gradient on \"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM.\" I will change the Tailwind CSS classes from `from-neutral-300 to-neutral-500` to the more contrasty and visually consistent `from-white to-neutral-600`.\n\n3.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Legacy Image Props:** To resolve the `npm run dev` warnings, I will update the `Image` component used for `pcp.gif`. I will remove the legacy `layout=\"fill\"` and `objectFit=\"cover\"` props. I will replace them with the modern `fill` prop and add `object-cover` to the `className`.\n\n4.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Legacy Image Props:** Similarly, I will update the `Image` components inside the `features.map` loop. I will remove the legacy `layout=\"fill\"` and `objectFit=\"cover\"` props and replace them with the `fill` prop and `object-cover` in the `className`. This will fix the remaining warnings.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/lamp.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/lamp.tsx\n// C10 - Expand lamp effect vertically and reduce luminosity\n'use client'\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils'\nimport { SparklesCore } from './sparkles' \n\nexport const LampContainer = ({\n  children,\n  className,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  className?: string\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        'relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 w-full rounded-md z-0 pt-20',\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      {/* Sparkles now fill the entire container */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 w-full h-full z-0\">\n          <SparklesCore\n            background=\"transparent\"\n            minSize={0.4}\n            maxSize={1.2}\n            particleDensity={1200}\n            className=\"w-full h-full\"\n            particleColor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative flex w-full flex-1 scale-y-150 items-center justify-center isolate z-10 \">\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto right-1/2 h-[45rem] overflow-visible w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-neutral-700 via-transparent to-transparent text-white [--conic-position:from_70deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] left-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_right,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ opacity: 0.5, width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, width: '80rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          style={{\n            backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(var(--conic-position), var(--tw-gradient-stops))`,\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto left-1/2 h-[45rem] w-[80rem] bg-gradient-conic from-transparent via-transparent to-neutral-700 text-white [--conic-position:from_290deg_at_center_top]\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-40 h-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950  bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_left,white,transparent)]\" />\n          <div className=\"absolute  w-[100%] right-0 bg-neutral-950 h-40 bottom-0 z-20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_top,white,transparent)]\" />\n        </motion.div>\n        \n        <div className=\"absolute top-1/2 z-50 h-48 w-full bg-transparent opacity-10 backdrop-blur-md\"></div>\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-36 w-[28rem] -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-neutral-500 opacity-50 blur-3xl\"></div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '8rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '16rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-30 h-36 w-64 -translate-y-[6rem] rounded-full bg-neutral-400 blur-2xl\"\n        ></motion.div>\n        <motion.div\n          initial={{ width: '15rem' }}\n          whileInView={{ width: '30rem' }}\n          transition={{\n            delay: 0.3,\n            duration: 0.8,\n            ease: 'easeInOut',\n          }}\n          className=\"absolute inset-auto z-50 h-0.5 w-[30rem] -translate-y-[12rem] bg-neutral-400 \"\n        ></motion.div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"relative z-40 flex -translate-y-20 flex-col items-center px-5\">\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx\n// C10 - Apply consistent gradient styling to title\n'use client';

My course of action is to make final adjustments to the Mission section's lamp effect, apply the correct gradient styling to its title, and resolve the legacy `next/image` warnings that appear during development.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   **Expand Lamp Effect Vertically (Green Bracket):** To ensure the lamp's light cone covers the entire vertical extent of the sparkles, I will increase the vertical scale of the container from `scale-y-150` to `scale-y-175`. This will stretch the effect downwards, eliminating the sliver at the bottom.\n    *   **Reduce Luminosity:** To address the \"light pollution,\" I will make the conic gradients dimmer. I will change the gradient color from `from-neutral-500` to a darker `from-neutral-600`. This will reduce the overall brightness of the lamp effect while maintaining its shape.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Apply Gradient Title Style:** I will apply the same gradient styling used on other section titles to the \"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM.\" header. I will add the classes `bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-white to-neutral-600` to the `h2` element to achieve the desired visual effect.\n\n3.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Legacy Image Props:** I will update the `<Image>` component used for `pcp.gif`. I will replace the deprecated `layout=\"fill\"` prop with the modern `fill` prop. I will also remove the `objectFit=\"cover\"` prop and instead apply the `object-cover` class directly in the `className`.\n\n4.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Legacy Image Props:** I will update the three `<Image>` components for the feature icons.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the user's feedback and will address the final visual polish issues in the Mission section and resolve the legacy `Image` component warnings.\n\nMy course of action is to:\n1.  Adjust the `lamp.tsx` component to expand the lamp effect vertically to fully cover the sparkles, and reduce its overall brightness.\n2.  Update the `MissionSection.tsx` component to apply a gradient style to the main title, matching the style of other section headers.\n3.  Refactor the `Image` components in `HeroSection.tsx` and `FeaturesSection.tsx` to replace the deprecated `layout` and `objectFit` props with the current `fill` and `style` props, eliminating the console warnings.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   **Expand Lamp Effect:** To fix the gap at the bottom of the sparkles effect (the \"green bracket\" issue), I will increase the vertical scale of the `div` containing the conic gradients from `scale-y-150` to `scale-y-200`. This will stretch the light cone downwards, ensuring it covers the entire particle area.\n    *   **Reduce Luminosity:** To decrease the overall light pollution, I will make the light source less intense by changing the conic gradient color from `from-neutral-500` to the darker `from-neutral-700`. I will also reduce the opacity of the main blur effect from `opacity-50` to `opacity-25`.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Style Title:** I will apply the standard gradient text styling to the `<h2>` title. This involves adding the `bg-gradient-to-br from-neutral-300 to-neutral-500 bg-clip-text text-transparent` classes, which will make its appearance consistent with \"The Power of Iteration\" title.\n\n3.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Legacy Image Props:** I will update the `Image` component used for `pcp.gif`.

This will stretch the light cone downwards, ensuring it fully encompasses the particle area.\n    *   To reduce the overall brightness, I will decrease the `opacity` of the two main conic gradient `motion.div` elements. I will change them from a default opacity to `opacity-50`, softening the light's intensity without altering its shape.\n\n2.  **`src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   I will apply the gradient text effect to the main heading. I will add the classes `bg-gradient-to-br from-neutral-300 to-neutral-500 py-4 bg-clip-text text-transparent` to the `h2` element to match the style of other prominent headings on the page.\n\n3.  **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**\n    *   I will update the `Image` component used for the `pcp.gif`. I will replace the legacy `layout=\"fill\"` and `objectFit=\"cover\"` props with the modern `fill` boolean prop and the `className=\"object-cover\"`.\n\n4.  **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   Similarly, I will update the `Image` component inside the `map` function.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the user's feedback and will implement the requested visual refinements and technical fixes. My course of action is to adjust the lamp effect in the Mission section to fully cover the particle background and reduce its brightness, apply the correct gradient style to the Mission section title, and update the legacy `next/image` properties in the Hero and Features sections to resolve the console warnings.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Coverage (Green Bracket):** To ensure the lamp effect covers the entire vertical space of the particle background, I will increase the overall height of the main `LampContainer` by changing its `min-h` property and adjusting the vertical scaling (`scale-y`) of the light cone `div`. This will extend the light effect downwards to cover the small sliver of particles at the bottom.\n    *   **Reduce Luminosity:** To decrease the overall brightness and light pollution, I will change the color in the conic gradients from `from-neutral-500` to a darker `from-neutral-800`. This will soften the light cone, making it less intense.\n\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Apply Gradient Style:** I will apply the standard title gradient classes to the \"THE RISE OF COGNITIVE CAPITALISM.\" `h2` element. The classes `bg-gradient-to-br from-neutral-300 to-neutral-500 bg-clip-text text-transparent` will be added to match the styling of other main headings on the page.\n\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Legacy Image Props:** I will find the `Image` component used for `pcp.gif`. I will replace the deprecated `layout=\"fill\"` and `objectFit=\"cover\"` props with the modern equivalent: the boolean `fill` prop and the Tailwind class `object-cover`.\n\n4.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:**\n    *   **Fix Legacy Image Props:** I will find the `Image` components used for the three feature icons.

My course of action is multi-pronged, focusing first on critical visual fixes for light mode and the hero section, then establishing a comprehensive plan for the major new feature—the Report Viewer—and finally, scaffolding the necessary files and updating documentation to reflect this new direction.\n\n**Key Actions:**\n1.  **Light Mode Overhaul:** I will implement a new, more readable color palette for the light theme by updating CSS variables in `globals.css` and adjusting component styles to respect theming, resolving the issues of poor contrast and invisible text.\n2.  **Hero Section Polish:** I will fix the white border around the `pcp.gif` by making its container transparent and increase its size for better visibility and impact.\n3.  **Report Viewer Integration Plan:** I will create a new planning artifact (`A20`) that details the step-by-step process for porting the report viewer from `aiascent.game`, including file placement, dependency management, and data handling.\n4.  **Documentation Alignment:** I will update the Master Artifact List, the Universal Task Checklist, and the Implementation Roadmap to incorporate the new tasks and plans.\n5.  **Scaffolding New Pages & Components:** I will create the placeholder pages for `/mission` and `/learn` to resolve the 404 errors, update the `/showcase` page to prepare for the report viewer, and add the necessary dependencies to `package.json`.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create New Artifact `A20`:** Author `A20-Report-Viewer-Integration-Plan.md` to outline the strategy for porting the report viewer components and data from `aiascent.game`.\n2.  **Update Master Artifact List `A0`:** Add the new `A20` artifact to the list.\n3.  **Update Roadmap `A11`:** Revise the implementation roadmap to include the new phase of work focusing on interactive features like the report viewer.\n4.  **Update Task Checklist `A4`:** Add new tasks for the light mode fixes, hero section adjustments, and the multi-step report viewer integration. Mark completed tasks from previous cycles.\n5.  **Update `package.json`:** Add `zustand` and `react-icons` as dependencies required for the report viewer components.\n6.  **Fix Light Mode Theme:**\n    *   Update `src/app/globals.css` with a revised set of CSS variables for the light theme (`:root`) to improve color contrast and readability.\n    *   Modify `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx` to use theme-aware background colors (`bg-card`) instead of hardcoded dark colors.\n    *   Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx` to use the `useTheme` hook to conditionally set particle and gradient colors, ensuring they are visible and aesthetically pleasing in light mode.\n7.  **Fix Hero Section `pcp.gif`:**\n    *   Modify `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx` to change the hardcoded `bg-gray-100` on the inner container to `bg-transparent`, removing the white border.\n    *   Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` to increase the size of the `ContainerScroll`'s card element, making the GIF larger and more prominent.\n8.  **Scaffold New Pages:**\n    *   Create `src/app/mission/page.tsx` with placeholder content based on artifact A19.\n    *   Create `src/app/learn/page.tsx` with placeholder content based on artifact A18.\n    *   Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to remove the old whitepaper component and prepare it to host the new report viewer.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A20-Report-Viewer-Integration-Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A20: aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan\n\n# Date Created: C11\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A comprehensive plan to port and integrate the interactive report viewer from the `aiascent.game` project into `aiascent.dev`.\n- **Tags:** roadmap, implementation plan, report viewer, showcase, integration\n\n## 1. Objective\n\nThe primary objective is to port the fully-featured, interactive report viewer from the `aiascent.game` project into the `aiascent.dev` website. This component will be reused across the site to display different forms of content, starting with \"The Ascent Report\" on the Showcase page.\n\n## 2. Phased Integration\n\n### Phase 1: Core Porting & Showcase Implementation\n\nThe immediate goal is to get the report viewer rendering the full \"Ascent Report\" on the `/showcase` page.\n\n1.  **File Placement:**\n    *   Create a new directory: `src/components/report`.\n    *   Copy all report-related components from `context/aiascentgame/report/` into this new directory. This includes: `ReportViewerModal.tsx`, `AudioControls.tsx`, `ImageNavigator.tsx`, `PageNavigator.tsx`, `PromptNavigator.tsx`, `ReportChatPanel.tsx`, `ReportProgressBar.tsx`, and `ReportTreeNav.tsx`.\n    *   Create a new directory for the Zustand store: `src/lib/stores/`.\n    *   Copy `reportStore.ts` into `src/lib/stores/reportStore.ts`.\n\n2.  **Dependency Management:**\n    *   The following dependencies must be added to `package.json`:\n        *   `zustand`: For state management.\n        *   `react-icons`: For icons used in the viewer's UI.\n        *   `re-resizable`: For the resizable chat panel.\n        *   `marked`: For rendering markdown content from the report.\n        *   `@types/marked`: TypeScript types for `marked`.\n\n3.  **Data & Asset Placement (Curator Actions):**\n    *   Place `reportContent.json` and `imageManifest.json` into `public/data/`.\n    *   Place the entire directory of report images into `public/assets/report/`. The `imageManifest.json`'s `basePath` should be updated to reflect this.\n    *   Place the embedding files (`report_faiss.index` and `report_chunks.json`) into `public/embeddings/`.\n\n4.  **Integration into `/showcase`:**\n    *   The `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` file will be refactored.\n    *   It will become a client component (`'use client'`).\n    *   It will import the `useReportStore` and the main `ReportViewer` component.\n    *   It will use a `useEffect` hook to trigger the `loadReportData` action from the store.\n    *   It will render the `ReportViewer` component, which will act as a full-page modal experience.\n\n### Phase 2: Homepage Whitepaper Viewer (Future Cycle)\n\n*   **Objective:** Reuse the report viewer framework on the homepage to display a smaller whitepaper within the \"Interactive visualization\" section.\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Convert the existing `whitepaperContent.json` into the `reportContent.json` and `imageManifest.json` format.\n    2.  Create a new instance of the report store or add functionality to the existing store to handle multiple report sources.\n    3.  Embed the `ReportViewer` in the `WorkflowSection.tsx` component, likely triggered by a button.\n\n### Phase 3: Learn Page Curriculum Viewer (Future Cycle)\n\n*   **Objective:** Use the report viewer on the `/learn` page to present a curriculum of multiple educational reports.\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Extend the `reportStore` and UI to support a list of available reports.\n    2.  Develop a selection UI (e.g., a dropdown or a list) that allows the user to switch between different reports.\n    3.  Each report will have its own content and manifest files.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\">\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C11 (Add A20 Report Viewer Integration Plan)\n\n## 1.

Overview & Goal\n\nThis document provides a clear, step-by-step roadmap for the implementation of **aiascent.dev**. This roadmap breaks the project vision (A1) into smaller, manageable, and testable steps. The goal is to build the functionality incrementally, ensuring a stable foundation at each stage.\n\n## 2. Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Foundational Setup & Landing Page (Cycles 1-10)\n\n-   **Goal:** Create the basic project structure, build a polished and responsive landing page, and refine the core visual identity.\n-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Scaffolding:** Set up the Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS (A3).\n    2.  **Version Control:** Initialize the Git repository (A14).\n    3.  **Core UI:** Implement the Header, Footer, and all sections of the home page (`HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `WorkflowSection`, `MissionSection`) based on A16.\n    4.  **Visual Polish:** Iteratively refine the UI, animations, and responsiveness based on feedback, including dark/light mode adjustments.\n-   **Outcome:** A visually complete, responsive, and polished static landing page.\n\n### Step 2: Interactive Feature Integration (Cycle 11+)\n\n-   **Goal:** Transition from a static site to a dynamic, interactive platform by porting and integrating the Report Viewer from `aiascent.game`.\n-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Planning:** Develop a detailed integration plan for the Report Viewer component (A20).\n    2.  **Scaffolding:** Create the necessary file structure (`/components/report`, `/lib/stores`) and add dependencies (`zustand`, `react-icons`, etc.).\n    3.  **Porting:** Copy and refactor the report viewer components and state management from the `aiascent.game` context.\n    4.  **Showcase Page Implementation:** Implement the `/showcase` page to host the Report Viewer, displaying the full \"Ascent Report\".\n    5.  **New Page Creation:** Create placeholder pages for `/mission` and `/learn` to resolve 404s and prepare for future content.\n-   **Outcome:** A functional interactive showcase that demonstrates the DCE's capabilities through a rich, explorable report.\n\n### Step 3: Content Expansion & Reusability (Future Cycles)\n\n-   **Goal:** Populate all pages with content and reuse the Report Viewer for different contexts.\n-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Content Population:** Implement the full content for the `/mission` and `/learn` pages based on their respective design documents (A19, A18).\n    2.  **Homepage Integration:** Adapt the Report Viewer to display a smaller whitepaper on the homepage.\n    3.  **Learn Page Integration:** Extend the Report Viewer to support a multi-report curriculum for the `/learn` page.\n-   **Outcome:** A feature-complete and content-rich website serving as the central hub for the DCE project.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\">\n# Artifact A4: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C11 (Add tasks for light mode, hero section, and report viewer integration)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the extensive feedback and new requirements from Cycle 11. My course of action is multi-faceted, prioritizing critical visual bugs (light mode, hero GIF), then establishing the foundational elements for the major new features (Report Viewer), and finally, updating all planning and documentation artifacts to reflect the new project trajectory.\n\nFirst, I will address the severe issues with the light mode theme by defining a comprehensive and accessible light color palette in `globals.css` and ensuring all components correctly utilize these theme variables. This includes fixing unreadable text, harsh borders, and clashing particle colors. Concurrently, I will correct the visual bugs in the `HeroSection` by removing the white border around the `pcp.gif` and expanding its size to fill the container more effectively, enhancing its visibility and impact.\n\nNext, I will create the necessary page files for `/mission` and `/learn` to resolve the existing 404 errors, populating them with placeholder content that aligns with their respective design documents (A19 and A18).\n\nTo properly plan for the significant task of integrating the AI Ascent Report Viewer, I will create a new planning artifact, `A20. aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan`. This document will serve as the blueprint, detailing the file structure for report data and assets, outlining the components that need to be created by porting them from the `aiascentgame` context, and defining a reusable architecture that will support displaying different reports on the Showcase, Home, and Learn pages.\n\nFinally, I will update the `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md`, `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`, and `A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md` to reflect the completion of the visual bug fixes, the creation of the new pages and planning documents, and to outline the phased implementation of the report viewer feature for the upcoming cycles.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Fix Light Mode Theme:**\n    *   Update `src/app/globals.css` to define a full set of CSS variables for a coherent light theme, including background, foreground, card, border, and accent colors.\n    *   Update `tailwind.config.ts` to reference these CSS variables, ensuring Tailwind's utility classes are theme-aware.\n    *   Modify `src/components/global/sparkles.tsx` to use a theme-appropriate particle color in light mode.\n    *   Adjust text and border colors in `FeaturesSection.tsx` and `WorkflowSection.tsx` to use semantic theme variables (`text-foreground`, `border-border`) instead of hardcoded dark-theme colors.\n\n2.  **Fix Hero Section GIF:**\n    *   Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` to remove the white background from the `ContainerScroll` component's inner card.\n    *   Adjust the styling of the `Image` component for `pcp.gif` to be larger, removing excess padding and borders to eliminate the white frame and better fill its container.\n\n3.  **Create New Pages:**\n    *   Create `src/app/mission/page.tsx` with placeholder content based on A19.\n    *   Create `src/app/learn/page.tsx` with placeholder content based on A18.\n\n4.  **Update Documentation:**\n    *   Create a new artifact `src/Artifacts/A20-Report-Viewer-Integration-Plan.md` to outline the strategy for porting and implementing the report viewer components.\n    *   Update `src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md` to include the new A20 artifact.\n    *   Update `src/Artifacts/A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md` to reflect the new, expanded scope including the multi-page report viewer implementation.\n    *   Update `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` with new tasks for the light mode fix, hero section fix, and the phased implementation of the report viewer.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/globals.css\">\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer base {\n  :root {\n    --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --popover: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --popover-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --primary: 217.2 91.2% 59.8%;\n    --primary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;\n    --secondary: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --secondary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --muted: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --muted-foreground: 215 20.2% 65.1%;\n    --accent: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --accent-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --destructive: 0 62.8% 30.6%;\n    --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --border: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --input: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --ring: 224.3 76.3% 48%;\n    --radius: 0.5rem;\n    --particle-color: #FFFFFF;\n  }\n\n  .light {\n    --background: 0 0% 98%;\n    --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --card: 0 0% 100%;\n    --card-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --popover: 0 0% 100%;\n    --popover-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;\n    --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --secondary: 210 40% 96.1%;\n    --secondary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;\n    --muted: 210 40% 96.1%;\n    --muted-foreground: 215.4 16.3% 46.9%;\n    --accent: 210 40% 96.1%;\n    --accent-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;\n    --destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%;\n    --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --border: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;\n    --input: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;\n    --ring: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;\n    --particle-color: #000000;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer base {\n  * {\n    @apply border-border;\n  }\n  body {\n    @apply bg-background text-foreground;\n  }\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/sparkles.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/sparkles.tsx\n// C11 -

Overview and Goal\n\nThe goal is to integrate the sophisticated, interactive report viewer from the `aiascent.game` project into `aiascent.dev`. This component will be the centerpiece of the `/showcase` page, will be reused on the homepage for an interactive whitepaper, and will form the basis of the curriculum system on the `/learn` page. This requires porting the existing code, adapting it to the `aiascent.dev` architecture, and ensuring it is reusable and configurable.\n\n## 2. Component Porting and Refactoring\n\nThe code provided in `context/aiascentgame/report/` will be ported and adapted into the `aiascent.dev` project.\n\n### 2.1. New File Structure\n\nThe following new files will be created:\n\n*   **State Management:**\n    *   `src/stores/reportStore.ts` (Ported and adapted from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`)\n*   **Main Component:**\n    *   `src/components/report/ReportViewer.tsx` (This will be the main container, adapted from `ReportViewerModal.tsx` to be embeddable rather than a modal).\n*   **Sub-components:**\n    *   `src/components/report/AudioControls.tsx`\n    *   `src/components/report/ImageNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `src/components/report/PageNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `src/components/report/PromptNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `src/components/report/ReportChatPanel.tsx`\n    *   `src/components/report/ReportProgressBar.tsx`\n    *   `src/components/report/ReportTreeNav.tsx`\n*   **Dependencies:**\n    *   The project will need `zustand` for state management. This will be added to `package.json`.\n\n### 2.2. Key Refactoring Changes\n\n*   **`ReportViewer.tsx`:** The main component will be refactored from a full-screen modal (`ReportViewerModal`) into a flexible container component that can be embedded within a page. It will accept a `reportId` prop to determine which report to load.\n*   **`reportStore.ts`:** The `loadReportData` action will be modified to dynamically fetch report files based on the `reportId`. For example, `fetch('/reports/ai-ascent-report/reportContent.json')`.\n*   **Styling:** All styling will be converted to use Tailwind CSS utility classes to ensure consistency with the `aiascent.dev` design system and support for light/dark modes. Inline styles will be removed where possible.\n\n## 3. Data and Asset Management\n\nA centralized directory structure will be established in the `public` folder to house all data, assets, and embeddings for various reports.\n\n### 3.1. Directory Structure for Reports\n\nThe curator should place all report-related files in the following structure:\n\n```\npublic/\n└── reports/\n    └── [report-id]/                // e.g., \"ai-ascent-report\", \"dce-whitepaper\"\n        ├── assets/                 // Directory for all images for this report\n        │   └── ... (image files)\n        ├── reportContent.json      // The main textual content of the report\n        ├── imageManifest.json      // The manifest linking content to images\n        ├── report_faiss.index      // (Optional) FAISS index for the \"Ask Ascentia\" feature\n        └── report_chunks.json      // (Optional) Text chunks for the RAG system\n```\n\n### 3.2. Curator Action Items\n\n1.  **Create Directories:** Create the `public/reports/ai-ascent-report/` directory.\n2.  **Copy Data:** Place the `reportContent.json` and `imageManifest.json` from `aiascentgame` into this new directory.\n3.  **Copy Assets:** Copy the entire image assets directory for the report into `public/reports/ai-ascent-report/assets/`.\n4.  **Copy Embeddings:** Place the `report_faiss.index` and `report_chunks.json` files into the report's directory.\n5.  **Update `imageManifest.json`:** Perform a find-and-replace on the `imageManifest.json` file. The `basePath` will need to be updated from its old value to `/reports/ai-ascent-report/assets/`.\n\n## 4. Phased Implementation\n\n1.  **Phase 1: Showcase Page (`/showcase`)**\n    *   Implement the full `ReportViewer` component on the `/showcase` page.\n    *   Hardcode the `reportId` prop to `\"ai-ascent-report\"`.\n    *   This will be the primary development and testing ground for the component.\n\n2.  **Phase 2: Homepage Integration**\n    *   Once stable, embed the `ReportViewer` component into the homepage's `WorkflowSection.tsx`.\n    *   The curator will need to provide a new set of report files for `report-id=\"dce-whitepaper\"`.\n    *   The component will be passed `reportId=\"dce-whitepaper\"`.\n\n3.  **Phase 3: Learn Page (`/learn`)**\n    *   Create a new component, `ReportSelector.tsx`, on the `/learn` page.\n    *   This component will list available reports (which can be fetched from a simple `manifest.json` in `public/reports/`).\n    *   Selecting a report will render the `ReportViewer` component with the corresponding `reportId`.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\">\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C11 (Add A20 Report Viewer Integration Plan)\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the comprehensive feedback and the new strategic direction. My course of action is multi-faceted, addressing visual bugs, creating new pages, planning a major feature port, and updating our documentation to reflect these new priorities.\n\nFirst, I will address the critical visual issues with the light mode theme. The current implementation is unusable, and I will introduce a proper light color palette in `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css` to ensure readability and aesthetic consistency across all components. This includes fixing text colors, backgrounds, and the particle colors in the mission section.\n\nConcurrently, I will fix the hero section by enlarging the `pcp.gif` and removing the white border around it to enhance its visual impact, as requested.\n\nNext, I will create the foundational pages for `/mission`, `/learn`, and `/showcase` to resolve the current 404 errors. The `/showcase` page will be the new home for the AI Ascent Report Viewer, which I will port from the `aiascentgame` context.\n\nTo manage this complex porting process, I will first create a new planning artifact, `A20 - Report Viewer Integration Plan.md`. This document will serve as a guide for the curator, detailing where to place all the necessary assets (JSON data, images, embeddings) for the report viewer to function correctly.\n\nFollowing the plan, I will copy the report viewer's components and state management logic into the `aiascent.dev` project, refactoring paths and dependencies to fit the new environment. This will be a significant task, resulting in a fully functional, interactive report on the `/showcase` page.\n\nFinally, I will update our core planning documents, `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` and `A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md`, to align them with the work completed and the new roadmap ahead.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Fix Light Mode Theme:**\n    *   Update `tailwind.config.ts` to define a proper set of colors for the light theme under the `:root` selector, complementing the existing dark theme variables. This will include colors for background, foreground, card, primary, secondary, and muted elements.\n    *   Modify `globals.css` to ensure these variables are applied correctly.\n    *   Update `src/components/global/sparkles.tsx` to use a more appropriate particle color for light mode, potentially using CSS variables to switch automatically.\n\n2.  **Enhance Hero Section GIF:**\n    *   Modify `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`.\n    *   Adjust the styling of the `ContainerScroll`'s child `div` to remove any white background and expand the `Image` component to fill more of the container, making it larger and removing the border.\n\n3.  **Create New Pages:**\n    *   Create `src/app/mission/page.tsx` to resolve the 404. It will render a new component containing the mission statement.\n    *   Create `src/app/learn/page.tsx` as a placeholder for the future curriculum viewer.\n    *   Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to prepare it for the report viewer integration.\n\n4.  **Plan and Execute Report Viewer Port:**\n    *   **Create `A20 - Report Viewer Integration Plan.md`:** This new artifact will detail the file placement for `reportContent.json`, `imageManifest.json`, `report_faiss.index`, `report_chunks.json`, and the `report-assets` image directory.\n    *   **Create Directories:** Establish `src/components/report` for the UI components and `src/lib/stores` for the Zustand store.\n    *   **Copy & Refactor Components:**\n        *   Copy `reportStore.ts` to `src/lib/stores/reportStore.ts`.\n        *   Copy all TSX components from `context/aiascentgame/report/` to `src/components/report/`.\n        *   Systematically refactor all copied files, updating import paths, removing game-specific dependencies (like `next-auth`), and adjusting styles to fit the `aiascent.dev` theme.\n    *   **Integrate into Showcase:** Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to import and render the newly ported `ReportViewer` component, making the AI Ascent report fully interactive on the site.\n\n5.  **Update Documentation:**\n    *   Revise `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to add new tasks for the light mode fix, report viewer port, and new page creation.\n    *   Update `src/Artifacts/A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md` to reflect the new focus on implementing the interactive showcase via the report viewer port.\n    *   Update `src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md` to include the new `A20` artifact.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A20 - Report Viewer Integration Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A20: aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan\n\n# Date Created: C11\n\n# Author: AI Model\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A technical guide for the curator on integrating the AI Ascent Report assets into the aiascent.dev project for the interactive showcase.\n- **Tags:** guide, documentation, project setup, showcase, report viewer, assets\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis document provides the necessary instructions for placing the pre-existing assets from the `aiascent.game` project into the `aiascent.dev` project structure. Correctly placing these files is essential for the ported Report Viewer component to function on the `/showcase` page.\n\nThis plan assumes you have the following assets from the `aiascent.game` project available:\n\n1.  `reportContent.json`\n2.  `imageManifest.json`\n3.  `report_faiss.index`\n4.  `report_chunks.json`\n5.  The entire `report-assets` directory containing all the report images.\n\n## 2. Asset Placement Instructions\n\nPlease copy the files and directories to the following locations within the `aiascent.dev` project root.\n\n### 2.1. Report Data and Manifest\n\nThese JSON files contain the text content and image metadata for the report.\n\n-   **Source Files:**\n    -   `reportContent.json`\n    -   `imageManifest.json`\n-   **Destination Directory:** `public/data/reports/`\n-   **Final Paths:**\n    -   `public/data/reports/reportContent.json`\n    -   `public/data/reports/imageManifest.json`\n\n### 2.2. Report Images\n\nThis directory contains all the `.webp` images for the report, organized by section and page.\n\n-   **Source Directory:** `report-assets/`\n-   **Destination Directory:** `public/images/`\n-   **Final Path:** `public/images/report-assets/`\n\n### 2.3. \"Ask Ascentia\" Knowledge Base\n\nThese files form the vector database that the \"Ask @Ascentia\" chat feature uses for its Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.\n\n-   **Source Files:**\n    -   `report_faiss.index`\n    -   `report_chunks.json`\n-   **Destination Directory:** `public/data/embeddings/`\n-   **Final Paths:**\n    -   `public/data/embeddings/report_faiss.index`\n    -   `public/data/embeddings/report_chunks.json`\n\n## 3. Summary of Final Structure\n\nAfter copying all assets, your `public` directory should contain the following structure:\n\n```\npublic/\n├── data/\n│   ├── reports/\n│   │   ├── reportContent.json\n│   │   └── imageManifest.json\n│   └── embeddings/\n│       ├── report_faiss.index\n│       └── report_chunks.json\n│\n├── images/\n│   └── report-assets/\n│       └── report-3/\n│           ├── introduction/\n│           ├── part-i-the-proof/\n│           │   └── ... (all other report image folders)\n│           └── ...\n│\n└── ... (other existing public assets)\n```\n\nOnce these assets are in place, the ported Report Viewer component will be able to fetch them and render the interactive report on the `/showcase` page.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\">\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C11 (Add A20 Report Viewer Integration Plan)\n\n## 1.

The rise of powerful AI presents a choice: a future where creative and technical power is concentrated in the hands of a few, or a future where it is radically decentralized, empowering individuals to build, create, and innovate on a scale never before imagined.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Our mission is to champion the latter. We are building tools for the **Citizen Architect**—the individual empowered by AI to design and construct complex systems, turning vision into reality with unprecedented speed and efficiency.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>Combating the Fissured Workplace</h2>\n        <p>\n          The dominant model of the AI industry relies on a \"fissured workplace\"—a global, fragmented network of underpaid and precarious gig workers. This model is not only exploitative; it is a strategic vulnerability. It degrades data quality, stifles innovation, and creates a brittle foundation for our technological future.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The Data Curation Environment (DCE) is our counter-proposal. It is a professional toolset built on the philosophy of **Cognitive Apprenticeship**. It transforms the chaotic, manual process of AI collaboration into a structured, repeatable, and scalable workflow. It is designed to elevate the craft of AI-assisted development, turning \"prompt-and-pray\" into a rigorous engineering discipline.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>Building a Community of Vibe Coders</h2>\n        <p>\n          We believe the future is built by those who can seamlessly blend human intuition with machine intelligence. We call this \"vibe coding.\" It's about more than just writing code; it's about orchestrating AI as a creative partner.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          AIAscent.dev is more than a website; it's the Schelling point for a community of builders, thinkers, and architects who share this vision. Through open-source tools, shared knowledge, and a commitment to empowering the individual, we aim to ensure that America remains a stabilizing force in the new AI-powered world, championing a future of decentralized innovation and individual sovereignty.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MissionPage;\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/learn/page.tsx\">\n// src/app/learn/page.tsx\n// C11 - New File\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst LearnPage = () => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto px-4 py-16 pt-32\">\n      <header className=\"text-center mb-12\">\n        <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl font-bold bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-foreground/80 to-foreground pb-4\">\n          Learn\n        </h1>\n        <p className=\"text-xl text-muted-foreground max-w-3xl mx-auto\">\n          Master the art and science of AI-assisted development.

          "content": "I have analyzed the extensive feedback and the multi-faceted request for Cycle 11. The core tasks involve fixing significant visual regressions in light mode, addressing issues with the hero section's GIF, and planning the integration of a major new feature: the Report Viewer from the `aiascentgame` project. My course of action is to prioritize documentation updates first, then address the critical visual bugs, and finally, scaffold the new pages and components for the upcoming features.\n\n### Course of Action\n\n1.  **Documentation First (Planning):**\n    *   I will create a new artifact, **`A20. aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan.md`**, to outline the strategy for porting and implementing the report viewer. This document will specify file locations for components, data (`reportContent.json`), and assets, serving as a blueprint for the curator.\n    *   I will update the **`A11. aiascent.dev - Implementation Roadmap.md`** to reflect the new tasks, including the light mode overhaul and the implementation of the Showcase, Learn, and Mission pages.\n    *   I will update the **`A4. aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist.md`** with the specific tasks for this cycle.\n    *   The **`A0. aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List.md`** will be updated to include the new `A20` artifact.\n\n2.  **Visual Bug Fixes (Styling):**\n    *   **Light Mode Overhaul:** I will perform a major update on **`src/app/globals.css`** to define a correct and aesthetically pleasing color palette for the light theme. This will fix the unreadable text, incorrect backgrounds, and clashing colors identified in the user's screenshots.\n    *   **Hero Section GIF:** In **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`**, I will adjust the styling to remove the white border around the `pcp.gif` and increase its size for better visibility, as requested.\n    *   **Component-Specific Theme Fixes:**\n        *   **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** I will modify the `SparklesCore` component to use theme-aware colors for its particles, ensuring they look good in both light and dark modes.\n        *   **`src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** I will correct the text color within the workflow step boxes to ensure visibility in light mode.\n\n3.  **New Page Implementation (Structure):**\n    *   To resolve the 404 errors, I will create the necessary page files:\n        *   **`src/app/mission/page.tsx`:** This page will be created and populated with content based on the blueprint in `A19`.\n        *   **`src/app/learn/page.tsx`:** A placeholder page will be created.\n        *   **`src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** This page will be created to serve as the host for the future Report Viewer component.\n\n4.  **Report Viewer Scaffolding (Porting):**\n    *   Based on the new `A20` plan, I will begin porting the Report Viewer by creating the necessary files. This includes:\n        *   Creating **`src/state/reportStore.ts`** for state management.\n        *   Creating a new directory **`src/components/report/`** and populating it with the adapted versions of the components from the `context/aiascentgame/report/` directory (`ReportViewer.tsx`, `ImageNavigator.tsx`, etc.).\n\nThis comprehensive approach addresses the immediate visual issues while laying the documented groundwork for the significant feature development ahead.\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\">\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C11 (Add A20 Report Viewer Integration Plan)\n\n## 1.

Overview & Goal\n\nThe goal of this initiative is to port the complex, interactive \"Report Viewer\" feature from the `aiascent.game` project into `aiascent.dev`. This will serve as the centerpiece of the `/showcase` page, displaying the full \"AI Ascent Report\" and demonstrating the power of the DCE by showcasing a sophisticated component built with it. This plan outlines the file structure, data placement, and step-by-step implementation process.\n\n## 2. File and Asset Placement Plan\n\n### 2.1. Curator Actions: Data and Asset Placement\n\nThe curator will need to place the report data and assets into the `public` directory of the `aiascent.dev` project.\n\n1.  **Report Content:**\n    *   **Source:** `context/aiascentgame/reportContent.json`\n    *   **Destination:** `public/data/reportContent.json`\n    *   *(A `data` directory will need to be created inside `public`)*.\n\n2.  **Report Images:**\n    *   **Source:** The full image directory for the AI Ascent report.\n    *   **Destination:** `public/assets/images/report/`\n    *   *The final structure should look like `public/assets/images/report/s01/p01/prompt-1/image-001.webp`, etc.*\n\n### 2.2. AI Actions: Component and State File Placement\n\nThe AI will create the necessary files within the `src` directory, adapting them from the `context/aiascentgame/report/` directory.\n\n1.  **State Management:**\n    *   **New File:** `src/state/reportStore.ts`\n    *   **Purpose:** A Zustand store to manage the state of the report viewer (current page, image index, chat, etc.). It will be adapted from the `aiascentgame` version.\n\n2.  **Components:**\n    *   **New Directory:** `src/components/report/`\n    *   **Files to Create:**\n        *   `ReportViewer.tsx`: The main container component that orchestrates all other parts.\n        *   `AudioControls.tsx`: Component for TTS audio playback.\n        *   `ImageNavigator.tsx`: Component for navigating between images and prompts.\n        *   `PageNavigator.tsx`: Component for navigating between report pages.\n        *   `ReportChatPanel.tsx`: The \"Ask Ascentia\" chat interface.\n        *   `ReportProgressBar.tsx`: The progress tracking bar.\n        *   `ReportTreeNav.tsx`: The collapsible tree navigator for report sections.\n\n## 3. Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Scaffolding (This Cycle)\n\n*   [ ] Create the new directories (`public/data`, `src/state`, `src/components/report`).\n*   [ ] Create all new component and state files listed above with placeholder or adapted content.\n*   [ ] Create the `/showcase` page (`src/app/showcase/page.tsx`) to act as a host for the `ReportViewer` component.\n\n### Step 2: State and Data Loading\n\n*   [ ] Fully implement `src/state/reportStore.ts`, including the logic to fetch and process `public/data/reportContent.json`. The image paths will need to be adjusted to point to the new location under `public/assets/images/report/`.\n*   [ ] The main `ReportViewer.tsx` component will initialize this store and fetch the data.\n\n### Step 3: Component Integration\n\n*   [ ] Assemble the individual components (`PageNavigator`, `ImageNavigator`, etc.) within `ReportViewer.tsx`.\n*   [ ] Wire up all component interactions to the actions and state provided by `reportStore.ts`.\n*   [ ] Ensure all styling is adapted to match the `aiascent.dev` theme.\n\n### Step 4: Finalization and Testing\n\n*   [ ] Integrate the complete `<ReportViewer />` into the `/showcase` page.\n*   [ ] Conduct thorough testing of all features: page navigation, image navigation, audio playback, chat functionality, and progress tracking.\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/app/globals.css\">\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer base {\n  :root {\n    --background: 240 10% 3.9%; /* Dark Blue-Gray */\n    --foreground: 0 0% 98%; /* Almost White */\n\n    --card: 240 10% 3.9%;\n    --card-foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n\n    --popover: 240 10% 3.9%;\n    --popover-foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n\n    --primary: 210 40% 98%; /* White */\n    --primary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%; /* Dark Blue */\n\n    --secondary: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%; /* Dark Blue */\n    --secondary-foreground: 0 0% 98%; /* Almost White */\n\n    --muted: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%; /* Darker Blue */\n    --muted-foreground: 215 20.2% 65.1%; /* Gray */\n\n    --accent: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --accent-foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n\n    --destructive: 0 62.8% 30.6%;\n    --destructive-foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n\n    --border: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --input: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --ring: 212.7 93.5% 61.2%; /* Bright Blue */\n  }\n\n  .light {\n    --background: 0 0% 98%; /* Almost White */\n    --foreground: 240 10% 3.9%; /* Dark Blue-Gray */\n\n    --card: 0 0% 100%; /* White */\n    --card-foreground: 240 10% 3.9%;\n\n    --popover: 0 0% 100%;\n    --popover-foreground: 240 10% 3.9%;\n\n    --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%; /* Blue */\n    --primary-foreground: 0 0% 98%; /* Almost White */\n\n    --secondary: 0 0% 96.1%; /* Light Gray */\n    --secondary-foreground: 240 10% 3.9%;\n\n    --muted: 0 0% 96.1%;\n    --muted-foreground: 240 3.8% 46.1%;\n\n    --accent: 0 0% 96.1%;\n    --accent-foreground: 240 10% 3.9%;\n\n    --destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%;\n    --destructive-foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n\n    --border: 0 0% 89.8%; /* Gray border */\n    --input: 0 0% 89.8%;\n    --ring: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer base {\n  * {\n    @apply border-border;\n  }\n  body {\n    @apply bg-background text-foreground;\n  }\n}\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C11 - Remove white border from gif container and expand it\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\nreturn (\n<section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-background rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n{/* Background Gradient */}\n<div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)] dark:[background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)] light:[background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#FFF_35%,#E0E7FF_100%)]\"></div>\n\n  {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n  <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-50px] md:mt-0\">\n    <ContainerScroll\n      titleComponent={\n        <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n          {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n          <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-foreground to-muted-foreground font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8 pt-16\">\n            Master the Human-AI Workflow.

          "content": "I have analyzed the extensive feedback and new feature requests. My course of action is to first address the immediate visual bugs related to the light mode theme and the hero section's GIF. Concurrently, I will update the project's planning documents to outline the implementation of the major new feature: porting the AI Ascent Report Viewer. This \"documentation-first\" approach ensures the larger tasks are well-planned before implementation begins.\n\nHere is a summary of the plan:\n\n1.  **Light Mode Theme Correction:** I will adjust the site's CSS variables in `globals.css` to provide a clean and readable light mode experience, fixing issues with text visibility, component backgrounds, and the particle colors in the mission section.\n2.  **Hero Section GIF Enhancement:** I will modify the `HeroSection` and its underlying `ContainerScroll` component to remove the white border around the `pcp.gif` and increase its size for better visibility, as requested.\n3.  **Resolve 404 Errors:** I will create placeholder pages for `/mission` and `/learn` to fix the broken links in the header, ensuring all navigation links are functional.\n4.  **Plan Report Viewer Integration:** I will create a new planning artifact, `A20`, to detail the process of porting the report viewer from the `aiascentgame` project. This document will serve as the blueprint for future implementation cycles and will include instructions for the curator regarding necessary assets.\n5.  **Update Core Documentation:** I will update the Master Artifact List (A0), the Universal Task Checklist (A4), and the Implementation Roadmap (A11) to reflect the completion of these fixes and the new plan for integrating the report viewer.\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/app/globals.css`:** Modify the CSS variables for the light theme (`:root`) to ensure proper contrast and readability. Change text to be dark, and backgrounds to be light. Adjust component-specific styles that may have hardcoded dark-theme colors.\n2.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** Import `useTheme` from `next-themes` to dynamically change the `particleColor` prop passed to the `SparklesCore` component. The color will be white in dark mode and a dark gray in light mode to ensure visibility against the background.\n3.  **Update `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`:** In the `Card` component, change the `bg-gray-100` class on the inner `div` to `bg-black` to remove the white border around the GIF and ensure it blends seamlessly with the dark hero section. I will also increase the height from `h-[30rem] md:h-[40rem]` to `h-[40rem] md:h-[50rem]` and remove the `max-w-5xl` constraint to allow the component to be larger.\n4.  **Update `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** Change the hardcoded `bg-neutral-950` on the workflow step divs to a semantic color like `bg-card` so it respects the current theme (light or dark).

Overview and Goal\n\nThe goal of this task is to integrate the complex, interactive report viewer from the `aiascent.game` project into `aiascent.dev`. This will serve as the primary content for the `/showcase` page, acting as a powerful demonstration of a complex component built with an AI-assisted workflow. The implementation must be reusable, as it will later be adapted for the homepage and the `/learn` page.\n\n## 2. Source Files for Porting\n\nThe following files from the `context/aiascentgame/report/` directory will be used as the foundation for the new components:\n\n-   `ReportViewerModal.tsx` (Core container)\n-   `reportStore.ts` (Zustand state management)\n-   `PageNavigator.tsx`\n-   `ImageNavigator.tsx`\n-   `PromptNavigator.tsx`\n-   `ReportProgressBar.tsx`\n-   `ReportTreeNav.tsx`\n-   `ReportChatPanel.tsx`\n-   `AudioControls.tsx`\n\n## 3. New File Structure in `aiascent.dev`\n\nThe ported files will be adapted and placed into a new, dedicated structure within the `src/` directory.\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── components/\n│   └── report/\n│       ├── AudioControls.tsx\n│       ├── ImageNavigator.tsx\n│       ├── PageNavigator.tsx\n│       ├── PromptNavigator.tsx\n│       ├── ReportChatPanel.tsx\n│       ├── ReportProgressBar.tsx\n│       ├── ReportTreeNav.tsx\n│       └── ReportViewer.tsx      // Renamed from ReportViewerModal.tsx\n│\n├── state/\n│   └── reportStore.ts\n│\n└── app/\n    └── showcase/\n        └── page.tsx              // This will import and render <ReportViewer />\n```\n\n## 4. Curator Instructions for Assets\n\nTo enable the report viewer, the curator must place the necessary data and image assets into the `public` directory.\n\n1.  **Report Data:**\n    *   **Source:** `context/aiascentgame/reportContent.json` and the corresponding `imageManifest.json` (if available, otherwise it needs to be generated).\n    *   **Destination:** Create a new directory `public/data/reports/` and place both JSON files inside.\n\n2.  **Report Images:**\n    *   **Source:** The entire `report-assets` directory containing the images for the AI Ascent report.\n    *   **Destination:** Copy the `report-assets` directory into `public/images/`. The final path should be `public/images/report-assets/`.\n\n3.  **Report Index & Embeddings (for \"Ask Ascentia\"):**\n    *   **Source:** `report_faiss.index` and `report_chunks.json` from the `aiascentgame` project.\n    *   **Destination:** Place these files in the `public/` directory of `aiascent.dev`. The backend will need to be configured to load these.\n\n## 5. Necessary Modifications During Implementation\n\nThe ported code cannot be used as-is and will require several key modifications:\n\n1.  **Component Refactoring:**\n    *   `ReportViewerModal.tsx` will be renamed to `ReportViewer.tsx` and refactored from a modal into a standard component that can be embedded directly into a page. The modal-specific overlay and closing logic will be removed.\n    *   Styling will need to be adapted from the game's specific style to match the `aiascent.dev` theme (using TailwindCSS and CSS variables).\n\n2.  **State Management (`reportStore.ts`):**\n    *   The store will be largely the same, but paths for fetching data (`/data/reports/...`) will need to be verified.\n    *   Any state related to the game's UI (like `uiStore` interactions) will be removed.\n\n3.  **Feature Removal:**\n    *   **Voting System:** All UI elements, state, and API calls related to image voting will be removed from `ImageNavigator.tsx` and `reportStore.ts`. This simplifies the initial porting effort.\n    *   **Login Dependency:** The dependency on `next-auth` for voting will be removed.\n\n4.  **Backend Dependencies (\"Ask Ascentia\" & Audio):**\n    *   The \"Ask Ascentia\" and audio narration features depend on backend API routes (`/api/tts/generate`, Socket.IO for chat). These backend routes will need to be ported or re-implemented in the `aiascent.dev` project in a subsequent cycle. For the initial implementation, these features may be stubbed out or disabled.\n\n## 6. Phased Implementation on `aiascent.dev`\n\n1.  **Cycle 1 (This Plan):** Define the plan and make preparations.\n2.  **Cycle 2-4 (Showcase):** Implement the core report viewer on the `/showcase` page. Focus on data loading, navigation, and visual styling. Defer backend-heavy features like \"Ask Ascentia\".\n3.  **Cycle 5 (Homepage):** Create a simplified, reusable version of the `ReportViewer` component and embed it on the homepage to display the DCE whitepaper.\n4.  **Cycle 6+ (Learn Page):** Enhance the `ReportViewer` to support a selection of multiple reports, and build out the `/learn` page as a curriculum hub.\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\">\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C11 (Add A20 Report Viewer Porting Plan)\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the comprehensive feedback from Cycle 11, which includes fixing significant visual bugs, planning for and implementing a major new feature (the Report Viewer), and updating project documentation.\n\nMy course of action is to first address the critical visual issues to improve the site's immediate presentation. This includes a full rework of the light mode theme, which is currently unusable, and fixing the layout of the hero section's animated GIF.\n\nConcurrently, I will perform the necessary planning for the new Showcase feature. This involves creating a detailed integration plan artifact that outlines how the AI Ascent Report Viewer from the `aiascentgame` context will be ported into this project. This plan will serve as the blueprint for subsequent implementation.\n\nFinally, I will create stub pages to resolve existing 404 errors and update our core planning documents to reflect the current state of the project and these new tasks.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create New Planning Artifact (`A20`):** Author a new artifact, `A20-Report-Viewer-Integration-Plan.md`, to detail the strategy for porting the report viewer components, data, and assets into the `aiascent.dev` project for the `/showcase` page.\n2.  **Update Master Artifact List (`A0`):** Add the new `A20` artifact to the master list.\n3.  **Update Task Checklist (`A4`):** Revise the `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to create new tasks for the light mode fixes, hero section adjustments, and the report viewer implementation, marking previous tasks as complete.\n4.  **Add Dependencies:** Update `package.json` to include `zustand` and `react-icons`, which are required for the report viewer components.\n5.  **Fix Light Mode Theme:**\n    *   Update `src/app/globals.css` with a proper, high-contrast set of CSS variables for the light theme (`:root`).\n    *   Make the particle color in `src/components/global/lamp.tsx` theme-aware by using the `useTheme` hook.\n    *   Update component styling in `FeaturesSection.tsx` and `WorkflowSection.tsx` to correctly adapt to both light and dark modes, fixing issues with borders and text visibility.\n6.  **Fix Hero Section GIF:**\n    *   Modify `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx` to remove the background color and padding that creates a white border around the `pcp.gif`.\n    *   Adjust the styling in `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` to enlarge the GIF container, making it more prominent as requested.\n7.  **Resolve 404 Errors:** Create new placeholder pages for `/mission` and `/learn` to provide a \"Coming Soon\" message instead of a 404 error.\n8.  **Add Curator Activity:** Provide instructions for the curator to install the new dependencies and prepare the report assets for the upcoming implementation phase.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\n1.  **Install Dependencies:** After the files are updated, please run `npm install` in your terminal to install the new `zustand` and `react-icons` packages.\n2.  **Prepare Report Assets:** For the upcoming implementation of the report viewer, please copy the following assets from your `aiascentgame` project:\n    *   Copy the entire `public/images/report-assets/` directory from `aiascentgame` into the `public/images/` directory of this project.\n    *   Copy the `reportContent.json` file from `aiascentgame` into the `public/data/` directory of this project.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A20-Report-Viewer-Integration-Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A20: aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan\n\n# Date Created: C11\n\n# Author: AI Model\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A detailed plan for porting and integrating the AI Ascent Report Viewer from the `aiascentgame` project into the `aiascent.dev` website to serve as the main component for the `/showcase` page.\n- **Tags:** plan, report viewer, showcase, integration, porting, roadmap\n\n## 1. Objective\n\nThe primary objective is to replicate the interactive report viewer from the `aiascentgame` project within the `aiascent.dev` website. This component will be the centerpiece of the `/showcase` page, displaying the full \"AI Ascent Report\" as a tangible demonstration of a complex system built using the DCE methodology.\n\n## 2. File Placement & Porting Strategy\n\nThe following files and directories will be copied from the `context/aiascentgame/` directory and placed into the `aiascent.dev` project structure.\n\n*   **Report Viewer Components:**\n    *   **Source:** All `.tsx` files from `context/aiascentgame/report/`.\n    *   **Destination:** A new directory at `src/components/report/`.\n    *   **Files:** `AudioControls.tsx`, `ImageNavigator.tsx`, `PageNavigator.tsx`, `PromptNavigator.tsx`, `ReportChatPanel.tsx`, `ReportProgressBar.tsx`, `ReportTreeNav.tsx`, and `ReportViewerModal.tsx`.\n\n*   **State Management:**\n    *   **Source:** `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`.\n    *   **Destination:** `src/lib/store/reportStore.ts`. A new `store` directory will be created inside `src/lib/`.\n\n*   **Data Files:**\n    *   **Source:** `context/aiascentgame/reportContent.json`.\n    *   **Destination:** `public/data/reportContent.json`. A new `data` directory will be created inside `public/`.\n    *   **Note:** The image manifest file is not present in the context, but the logic should be prepared to use it if provided. For now, the implementation will rely on the structure within `reportContent.json`.\n\n*   **Image Assets:**\n    *   **Source:** The curator will manually copy the entire `report-assets` directory from the `aiascentgame` project's `public/images/` folder.\n    *   **Destination:** `public/images/report-assets/`.\n\n## 3. Required Dependencies\n\nThe following npm packages must be added to `package.json` to support the report viewer components.\n\n*   `zustand`: For state management (`reportStore.ts`).\n*   `react-icons`: For icons used throughout the report viewer UI.\n\n## 4. Refactoring and Modifications\n\nSeveral changes will be required to adapt the components to the `aiascent.dev` environment.\n\n*   **Voting System Removal:** The report viewer components, particularly `ImageNavigator.tsx` and `reportStore.ts`, contain logic related to a user voting system that relies on `next-auth/react`. This project does not have user authentication. All code related to `useSession`, `castVote`, and displaying vote counts will be removed or commented out.\n*   **Narration System:** The audio narration feature will be retained. The API endpoint `/api/tts/generate` will need to be created in the `aiascent.dev` backend if it's not already present. For now, the frontend components will be ported with the hooks intact.\n*   **Styling:** The components use inline styles. These will be retained for now to ensure a direct port, but a future refactoring task could be to convert them to TailwindCSS classes for better consistency with the rest of the site.\n*   **Component Imports:** All relative import paths within the ported components will be updated to reflect their new location in `src/components/report/` and `src/lib/store/`.\n\n## 5. Implementation Roadmap\n\n1.  **(Curator)** Add `zustand` and `react-icons` to `package.json` and run `npm install`.\n2.  **(AI)** Copy the component files from context to `src/components/report/`.\n3.  **(AI)** Copy the store file to `src/lib/store/reportStore.ts`.\n4.  **(Curator)** Copy the `reportContent.json` and `report-assets` images to their destination directories.\n5.  **(AI)** Create the `/showcase` page at `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`.\n6.  **(AI)** The `showcase` page will be a client component that initializes the `reportStore` and renders the main `ReportViewerModal.tsx` component.\n7.  **(AI)** Refactor the ported components to remove all voting logic and fix any broken dependencies or imports.\n8.  **(AI)** Ensure the `ReportViewerModal` correctly fetches and displays the data from the JSON file and that all navigation (page, image) functions as expected.\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\">\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C11 (Add A20 Report Viewer Integration Plan)\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the comprehensive feedback and feature requests from Cycle 11. My course of action is multi-faceted, prioritizing immediate visual fixes while simultaneously laying the complete groundwork for the major new feature: the report viewer.\n\nFirst, I will address the visual issues. I will fix the `pcp.gif` in the hero section by removing its white border and expanding its size for better visibility. Concurrently, I will perform a significant overhaul of the site's light mode theme by defining a proper color palette in `globals.css` and updating all homepage components to use theme-aware styles, ensuring readability and aesthetic coherence. This includes modifying the particle effect to be visible on a light background.\n\nNext, I will tackle the new feature requests. I will create a new planning artifact, `A20-Report-Viewer-Integration-Plan.md`, to guide the curator on how to integrate the provided report viewer assets. I will also create placeholder pages for the `/mission` and `/learn` routes to fix the current 404 errors.\n\nThen, I will perform the initial porting and scaffolding for the report viewer. This involves creating the necessary directories, copying the component files from the `aiascentgame` context, adding required dependencies to `package.json`, and performing initial modifications to remove now-unnecessary features like the voting system.\n\nFinally, I will create the new `/showcase` page and perform the initial integration of the ported report viewer component, setting the stage for wiring up the data in the next cycle. I will conclude by updating the project's task checklist to reflect this progress.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`:** Modify the `Card` component's inner `div` to use `bg-background` instead of `bg-gray-100` to remove the white border around the hero GIF in dark mode. Increase the container's height to make the GIF larger.\n2.  **Update `src/app/globals.css`:** Define a complete set of CSS variables for the light theme under the `:root` selector, inverting the dark theme's color scheme for background, foreground, cards, and text.\n3.  **Update `tailwind.config.ts`:** Add a new gradient for light mode text.\n4.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Replace hardcoded text colors with theme-aware classes like `text-foreground` and `text-muted-foreground` to ensure readability in both light and dark modes.\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** Change hardcoded text and border colors to theme-aware classes (`text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`) for proper light mode display.\n6.  **Update `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** Update the background and text colors of the workflow steps to use theme-aware classes (`bg-card`, `text-primary`) so they are visible in light mode.\n7.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** Modify the component to detect the current theme and pass it as a prop to the `LampContainer`.\n8.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** Refactor the component to accept a `theme` prop and conditionally set the `particleColor` in the `SparklesCore` component to ensure visibility in light mode.\n9.  **Create `src/app/mission/page.tsx`:** Create a placeholder page to resolve the 404 error.\n10. **Create `src/app/learn/page.tsx`:** Create another placeholder page to resolve the 404 error.\n11. **Create `src/Artifacts/A20-Report-Viewer-Integration-Plan.md`:** Create a new planning document detailing file placement and curator actions for the report viewer integration.\n12. **Update `package.json`:** Add `zustand`, `react-icons`, `re-resizable`, and `markdown-it` as dependencies.\n13. **Scaffold Report Viewer Directories:** Create `src/components/report` and `src/lib/store`.\n14. **Port Report Viewer Files:** Copy `reportStore.ts` and all report viewer TSX components from the context into the new directories. Rename `ReportViewerModal.tsx` to `ReportViewer.tsx`.\n15. **Modify `src/components/report/ImageNavigator.tsx`:** Remove the `useSession` hook and the entire voting UI and logic, as it is not needed.\n16. **Create `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** Implement the new showcase page, which will import and render the `ReportViewer` component.\n17. **Update `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`:** Update the checklist to reflect completed tasks and plan for Cycle 12.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nAfter the files are updated, please run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependencies required for the report viewer:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx\">\n'use client'\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react'\nimport { useScroll, useTransform, motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\n// Define the type for the children prop, which will contain the visuals (images/gifs)\ntype ContainerScrollProps = {\ntitleComponent: string | React.ReactNode;\nchildren: React.ReactNode; // Added children prop\n};\n\nexport const ContainerScroll = ({\ntitleComponent,\nchildren, // Destructure children\n}: ContainerScrollProps) => {\nconst containerRef = useRef<any>(null)\nconst { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({\ntarget: containerRef,\n})\nconst [isMobile, setIsMobile] = React.useState(false)\n\nReact.useEffect(() => {\nconst checkMobile = () => {\nsetIsMobile(window.innerWidth <= 768)\n}\ncheckMobile()\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\nreturn () => {\nwindow.removeEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\n}\n}, [])\n\nconst scaleDimensions = () => {\nreturn isMobile ?

Report Viewer Integration Plan\n\n# Date Created: C11\n\n# Author: AI Model\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A guide for the curator on integrating the `aiascent.game` report viewer components into the `aiascent.dev` project for use in the Showcase, Learn, and Home pages.\n- **Tags:** guide, roadmap, report viewer, integration, showcase, learn\n\n## 1. Overview & Goal\n\nThe goal is to port the interactive report viewer from the `aiascent.game` project into `aiascent.dev` to create a rich, interactive content experience. This plan outlines the necessary file placements and actions the curator must take to prepare the project for this integration.\n\n## 2. File Placement Strategy\n\nThe ported components and data will be organized into a logical structure within the `src` directory to keep them modular and maintainable.\n\n### 2.1. Component Placement\n\nAll React components related to the report viewer should be placed in a new, dedicated directory.\n\n- **Source:** `context/aiascentgame/report/`\n- **Destination:** `src/components/report/`\n\n### 2.2. State Management\n\nThe Zustand store for the report viewer will be placed in a new subdirectory within `src/lib/`.\n\n- **Source:** `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`\n- **Destination:** `src/lib/store/reportStore.ts`\n\n### 2.3. Data Files\n\nThe report's content, image manifest, and embedding files will reside in the `public` directory to be publicly accessible for fetching.\n\n- **Source (From Curator):** `reportContent.json`, `imageManifest.json`, `report_faiss.index`, `report_chunks.json`\n- **Destination:** `public/data/`\n\n### 2.4. Image Assets\n\nAll images referenced by `imageManifest.json` must be placed in a corresponding directory under `public/assets/`.\n\n- **Source (From Curator):** All report images.\n- **Destination:** `public/assets/images/report/`\n\n**IMPORTANT:** The `basePath` in `imageManifest.json` will likely need to be updated from `/images/report-assets/report-3/` to `/assets/images/report/` to match this new structure.\n\n## 3. Curator Action Plan\n\nPlease perform the following steps to prepare the codebase:\n\n1.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` in your terminal to install `zustand`, `react-icons`, `re-resizable`, and `markdown-it`, which have been added to `package.json`.\n\n2.  **Copy Components:**\n    *   Copy all `.tsx` files from `context/aiascentgame/report/` into `src/components/report/`.\n    *   Rename `src/components/report/ReportViewerModal.tsx` to `src/components/report/ReportViewer.tsx`.\n\n3.  **Copy State Store:**\n    *   Copy `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts` to `src/lib/store/reportStore.ts`.\n\n4.  **Place Data Files:**\n    *   Create the `public/data/` directory if it doesn't exist.\n    *   Place your `reportContent.json`, `imageManifest.json`, `report_faiss.index`, and `report_chunks.json` files into `public/data/`.\n\n5.  **Place Image Files:**\n    *   Create the `public/assets/images/report/` directory.\n    *   Copy your entire report image folder structure into this new directory.\n    *   Verify that the paths in `imageManifest.json` align with this new location. For example, a path should now resolve to `public/assets/images/report/part-i-the-proof/...`.\n\n## 4. Next Steps (AI Implementation)\n\nOnce these curator actions are complete, the next development cycle will focus on:\n1.  Updating all import paths in the ported components to reflect their new locations.\n2.  Wiring up the `ReportViewer` component in `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`.\n3.  Ensuring the `reportStore` correctly fetches the JSON data from the `public/data/` directory.\n4.  Styling the component to fit seamlessly within the `aiascent.dev` aesthetic.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.3.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.3.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"markdown-it\": \"^14.1.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-icons\": \"^5.2.1\",\n    \"re-resizable\": \"^6.9.11\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\",\n    \"zustand\": \"^4.5.2\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/markdown-it\": \"^14.1.1\",\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/lib/store/reportStore.ts\">\n// src/state/reportStore.ts\n// PORTED FROM AIASCENT.GAME CONTEXT\n// Updated on: C1401 (Add state for Ascentia message audio narration.)\n// Updated on: C1399 (Implement playback speed control and fix continuous autoplay.)\n// Updated on: C1398 (Complete refactor of autoplay and slideshow logic to fix bugs and implement correct timer handling.)\n// Updated on: C1397 (Add volume and mute state.

Purpose\n\nThis artifact provides a structured format for tracking development tasks for the `aiascent.dev` website. It organizes work by the group of files involved and estimates complexity to aid in planning for AI-assisted development.\n\n## Task List for Cycle 12+\n\n## T-8: Report Viewer Data Integration (Cycle 12)\n- **Files Involved:**\n    - `src/lib/store/reportStore.ts`\n    - `src/components/report/ReportViewer.tsx`\n    - `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`\n    - All other `src/components/report/*.tsx` files\n- **Total Tokens:** ~25,000\n- **More than one cycle?** Yes\n- **Status:** To Do\n\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 8.1):** Implement the `loadReportData` function in `reportStore.ts` to fetch and process `reportContent.json` and `imageManifest.json` from `/data/`.\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 8.2):** Update all ported report components to use the correct import paths for the store and other components.\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 8.3):** Refactor `ReportViewer.tsx` to be triggered from the `showcase` page, likely as a full-screen modal overlay.\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 8.4):** Wire up all state and actions from the `reportStore` to the components to enable navigation, panel toggling, etc.\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 8.5):** Implement the API proxy for TTS narration (`/api/tts/generate`) and the socket connection for the \"Ask Ascentia\" feature.\n\n### Verification Steps\n1. Navigate to `/showcase`.\n2. **Expected:** An interactive report viewer opens, displaying the content from the AI Ascent Report. All navigation (pages, images), panels (tree, chat), and audio narration should function correctly.\n\n---\n## Completed Tasks\n\n## T-7: Visual Polish & Report Viewer Scaffolding (Cycle 11)\n- **Status:** Completed (C11)\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 7.1):** Fix hero section `pcp.gif` white border and increase its size.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 7.2):** Overhaul the light mode theme with a proper color palette and update all components to be theme-aware.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 7.3):** Create placeholder pages for `/mission` and `/learn` to fix 404s.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 7.4):** Create `A20-Report-Viewer-Integration-Plan.md`.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 7.5):** Add new dependencies (`zustand`, `react-icons`, etc.) to `package.json`.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 7.6):** Port and scaffold all report viewer component files and the report store into `src/components/report/` and `src/lib/store/`.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 7.7):** Remove voting system logic from ported components.\n- [X] **Task (T-ID: 7.8):** Create `showcase` page and perform initial component integration.\n\n## T-1 to T-6\n- **Status:** Completed (C1-C10)\n</file_artifact>\n"

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the comprehensive feedback and new feature requests. My course of action is to address the immediate visual bugs related to light mode and the hero section, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for the major new feature: the integration of the AI Ascent report viewer.\n\nThis will be a multi-faceted cycle. I will begin by creating a new planning artifact to outline the report viewer integration, ensuring the curator knows where to place all necessary files. Concurrently, I will update the project's roadmap and task list to reflect this new scope.\n\nNext, I will tackle the visual fixes. I will implement a proper light mode color scheme across the entire application to resolve the readability and aesthetic issues highlighted in the screenshots. I will also adjust the hero section to remove the white border around the `pcp.gif` and expand its size for better visibility, as requested.\n\nFinally, I will create the placeholder pages for the new sections (`/mission`, `/learn`) and update the project's dependencies to prepare for the report viewer component integration in the next cycle.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create `A20 - Report Viewer Integration Plan`:** Author a new documentation artifact that provides a clear plan for porting the report viewer components from `aiascent.game`.

Overview & Goal\n\nThe vision for `aiascent.dev` is to create a living testament to the capabilities of the DCE. A core part of this is showcasing complex artifacts built with the tool. This document outlines the plan to port the fully-featured, interactive \"Report Delivery System\" (RDS) from the `aiascent.game` project into `aiascent.dev`.\n\nThe goal is to reuse this powerful component across multiple pages to display different forms of content, starting with the full \"AI Ascent Report\" on the `/showcase` page.\n\n## 2. File Placement and Migration Strategy\n\nThe curator has provided the necessary source files from `aiascent.game` in the `context/aiascentgame/report` directory. This plan specifies their new locations within the `aiascent-dev` project.\n\n### 2.1. React Components\n\nThe report viewer is a complex, multi-component system. All related `.tsx` files should be placed in a new, dedicated directory.\n\n- **Source:** `context/aiascentgame/report/*.tsx`\n- **Destination:** `src/components/report/`\n\nThis includes:\n- `ReportViewerModal.tsx` (will be adapted to be a non-modal component)\n- `AudioControls.tsx`\n- `ImageNavigator.tsx`\n- `PageNavigator.tsx`\n- `PromptNavigator.tsx`\n- `ReportChatPanel.tsx`\n- `ReportProgressBar.tsx`\n- `ReportTreeNav.tsx`\n\n### 2.2. State Management (Zustand Store)\n\nThe report viewer relies on a Zustand store for its state. This file should be placed with other application state logic.\n\n- **Source:** `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`\n- **Destination:** `src/lib/store/reportStore.ts` (A new `store` directory will be created inside `lib`)\n\n### 2.3. Data Files\n\nThe report's content and image metadata are stored in JSON files. These should be placed in the `public` directory to be fetchable by the client.\n\n- **Source:** `context/aiascentgame/reportContent.json` (and the associated `imageManifest.json`)\n- **Curator Action:** Place these files in `public/data/reports/`. The `reportStore` will be configured to fetch from this path.\n\n### 2.4. Image Assets\n\nAll images referenced by the report should be stored in a structured directory within `public/assets`.\n\n- **Source:** The full image directory for the AI Ascent report.\n- **Curator Action:** Place the report's image folder (e.g., `report-3`) inside `public/assets/images/reports/`. The `imageManifest.json` will use a `basePath` that points to this location (e.g., `/assets/images/reports/report-3/`).\n\n## 3. Phased Implementation\n\n### Phase 1: Scaffolding & Dependencies (Cycle 11)\n\n1.  **Dependencies:** Add `zustand`, `react-icons`, and `re-resizable` to `package.json`.\n2.  **File Migration:** Copy the component and store files to their new destinations as specified above.\n3.  **Page Creation:** Create placeholder pages for `/showcase`, `/learn`, and `/mission` to eliminate 404 errors.\n\n### Phase 2: Showcase Page Integration (Cycle 12+)\n\n1.  **Component Adaptation:** Refactor `ReportViewerModal.tsx` into a `ReportViewer.tsx` component that can be rendered directly on a page instead of as a modal.\n2.  **Store Adaptation:** Modify `reportStore.ts` to fetch data from the new paths within `aiascent.dev` (`/data/reports/...`).\n3.  **Integration:** Embed the new `ReportViewer` component into the `/showcase/page.tsx` and ensure the full AI Ascent Report is loaded and interactive.\n\n### Phase 3: Homepage & Learn Page Integration (Future Cycles)\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Create a new, smaller report (a \"whitepaper\") in the same JSON format. Integrate the `ReportViewer` component into the homepage's \"Interactive visualization\" section, configured to load this new whitepaper.\n2.  **Learn Page:** Enhance the `ReportViewer` and its store to manage and switch between multiple reports. This will allow the `/learn` page to serve as a curriculum hub where users can select from different lessons, each presented as an interactive report.\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.3.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.3.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-icons\": \"^5.2.1\",\n    \"re-resizable\": \"^6.9.11\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\",\n    \"zustand\": \"^4.5.2\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/app/globals.css\">\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer base {\n  :root {\n    --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%; /* Dark background */\n    --foreground: 210 40% 98%; /* Light text */\n\n    --card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n    --popover: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --popover-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n    --primary: 217.2 91.2% 59.8%;\n    --primary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;\n\n    --secondary: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --secondary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n    --muted: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --muted-foreground: 215 20.2% 65.1%;\n\n    --accent: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --accent-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n    --destructive: 0 62.8% 30.6%;\n    --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n    --border: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --input: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --ring: 224.3 76.3% 48%;\n\n    --radius: 0.5rem;\n  }\n\n  .light {\n    --background: 0 0% 100%; /* Light background */\n    --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%; /* Dark text */\n\n    --card: 0 0% 100%;\n    --card-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n\n    --popover: 0 0% 100%;\n    --popover-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n\n    --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;\n    --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n    --secondary: 210 40% 96.1%;\n    --secondary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;\n\n    --muted: 210 40% 96.1%;\n    --muted-foreground: 215.4 16.3% 46.9%;\n\n    --accent: 210 40% 96.1%;\n    --accent-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;\n\n    --destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%;\n    --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n    --border: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;\n    --input: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;\n    --ring: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer base {\n  * {\n    @apply border-border;\n  }\n  body {\n    @apply bg-background text-foreground;\n  }\n}\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx\n// C11 - Remove inner background for GIF display\n'use client'\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react'\nimport { useScroll, useTransform, motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\n// Define the type for the children prop, which will contain the visuals (images/gifs)\ntype ContainerScrollProps = {\ntitleComponent: string | React.ReactNode;\nchildren: React.ReactNode; // Added children prop\n};\n\nexport const ContainerScroll = ({\ntitleComponent,\nchildren, // Destructure children\n}: ContainerScrollProps) => {\nconst containerRef = useRef<any>(null)\nconst { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({\ntarget: containerRef,\n})\nconst [isMobile, setIsMobile] = React.useState(false)\n\nReact.useEffect(() => {\nconst checkMobile = () => {\nsetIsMobile(window.innerWidth <= 768)\n}\ncheckMobile()\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\nreturn () => {\nwindow.removeEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\n}\n}, [])\n\nconst scaleDimensions = () => {\nreturn isMobile ?

          "content": "I have analyzed the extensive feedback and the multi-faceted request. My course of action is to first address all the critical visual and thematic issues currently present on the website. This includes a complete overhaul of the light mode theme, fixing layout and sizing problems in the hero section, and creating the missing `mission` and `learn` pages.\n\nConcurrently, I will lay the groundwork for the next major phase of development by producing a comprehensive planning document for the integration of the AI Ascent Report Viewer. This ensures that while we fix current issues, we are also strategically preparing for future feature development.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of my actions this cycle:\n\n1.  **Light Mode Overhaul:**\n    *   I will rewrite the light and dark theme color definitions in `src/app/globals.css` to establish a professional, high-contrast, and aesthetically pleasing light mode. This will resolve the widespread issues of unreadable text and clashing backgrounds.\n    *   I will remove hardcoded dark background colors from `HeroSection.tsx`, `MissionSection.tsx`, and `WorkflowSection.tsx`, replacing them with theme-aware `bg-background` or `bg-card` classes to ensure they adapt correctly to the selected theme.\n    *   I will update the `lamp.tsx` component to use the `useTheme` hook, allowing the particle colors in the `SparklesCore` component to dynamically switch between light and dark, ensuring they are always visible.\n\n2.  **Hero Section `pcp.gif` Fixes:**\n    *   To eliminate the white border around the GIF, I will modify the `container-scroll-animation.tsx` component, changing the `bg-gray-100` on the internal container to `bg-transparent`.\n    *   To increase the GIF's size and visibility as requested, I will adjust the padding within the `ContainerScroll`'s `Card` component, giving the GIF more room to expand within its frame.\n\n3.  **New Page Creation:**\n    *   I will create the `src/app/mission/page.tsx` file. The content will be based on the blueprint in artifact `A19` and infused with the strategic narrative you provided regarding \"solarpunk prime,\" the \"fissured workplace,\" and the \"cognitive apprenticeship\" model.\n    *   I will create a placeholder page for `src/app/learn/page.tsx` to resolve the 404 error and prepare for its future development.\n    *   I will update the existing `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to serve as a proper landing page for the forthcoming Report Viewer.\n\n4.  **Strategic Planning for Report Viewer:**\n    *   I will create a new planning artifact, `A20.aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan.md`, which will serve as the roadmap for porting the report viewer from the `aiascentgame` context. This document will detail the file structure, data placement, and a phased implementation plan for integrating the viewer into the Showcase, Learn, and Home pages.\n\n5.  **Documentation Alignment:**\n    *   I will update the `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md` to include the new `A20` planning artifact.\n    *   I will update `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` and `A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md` to reflect the completion of the visual fixes and outline the newly planned tasks for the Report Viewer integration.\n\nI will now proceed with generating the updated code and documentation.\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/app/globals.css`:** Redefine the `:root` (light mode) and `.dark` CSS variables to create a functional and aesthetic light theme, fixing contrast and color issues.\n2.  **Update `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`:** Modify the `Card` component's internal `div` to have a transparent background, removing the white border around the hero GIF. Reduce internal padding to allow the GIF to be larger.\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Adjust the styling to ensure the `pcp.gif` is larger and more prominent within the `ContainerScroll` component.\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** Implement the `useTheme` hook to dynamically change the `particleColor` of the `SparklesCore` component based on whether the theme is light or dark.\n5.  **Update `src/components/home/MissionSection.tsx`:** Change the hardcoded dark background of the `LampContainer` to a theme-aware class like `bg-background`.\n6.  **Update `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** Adjust the styling of the workflow step boxes to ensure text is readable in both light and dark modes.\n7.  **Create `src/app/mission/page.tsx`:** Create the new Mission page with content derived from A19 and the user's latest narrative direction.\n8.  **Create `src/app/learn/page.tsx`:** Create a placeholder page to resolve the 404 error.\n9.  **Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** Update the page to be a proper placeholder for the future Report Viewer component.\n10. **Create `src/Artifacts/A20.aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan.md`:** Author the new planning artifact detailing the multi-phase integration of the report viewer.\n11. **Update `src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md`:** Add the new A20 artifact to the master list.\n12. **Update `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`:** Update the checklist to reflect completed visual fixes and add new tasks for the report viewer implementation.\n13. **Update `src/Artifacts/A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md`:** Update the implementation roadmap to include the major new feature of the report viewer.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<summary>\nI have analyzed the request and will execute a two-pronged approach. First, I will perform a comprehensive visual overhaul, focusing on fixing the broken light mode theme, enlarging the hero section GIF, and resolving various styling inconsistencies. Second, I will create the missing 'Mission' and 'Learn' pages and produce a detailed planning artifact that outlines the strategy for integrating the complex Report Viewer component in subsequent cycles. This will both stabilize the current build and prepare us for the next major feature implementation.\n</summary>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/globals.css\">\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer base {\n  :root {\n    --background: 240 5% 96%; /* Light Gray */\n    --foreground: 240 10% 3.9%; /* Almost Black */\n\n    --card: 240 4.8% 95.9%;\n    --card-foreground: 240 10% 3.9%;\n\n    --popover: 0 0% 100%;\n    --popover-foreground: 240 10% 3.9%;\n\n    --primary: 240 5.9% 10%;\n    --primary-foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n\n    --secondary: 240 4.8% 95.9%;\n    --secondary-foreground: 240 5.9% 10%;\n\n    --muted: 240 4.8% 95.9%;\n    --muted-foreground: 240 3.8% 46.1%;\n\n    --accent: 240 4.8% 95.9%;\n    --accent-foreground: 240 5.9% 10%;\n\n    --destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%;\n    --destructive-foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n\n    --border: 240 5.9% 90%;\n    --input: 240 5.9% 90%;\n    --ring: 240 5% 64.9%;\n\n    --radius: 0.5rem;\n  }\n\n  .dark {\n    --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n    --card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n    --popover: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --popover-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n    --primary: 217.2 91.2% 59.8%;\n    --primary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;\n\n    --secondary: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --secondary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n    --muted: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --muted-foreground: 215 20.2% 65.1%;\n\n    --accent: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --accent-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n    --destructive: 0 62.8% 30.6%;\n    --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n    --border: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --input: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --ring: 224.3 76.3% 48%;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer base {\n  * {\n    @apply border-border;\n  }\n  body {\n    @apply bg-background text-foreground;\n  }\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx\n// C11 - Fix white border on GIF by changing background and adjusting padding\n'use client'\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react'\nimport { useScroll, useTransform, motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\n// Define the type for the children prop, which will contain the visuals (images/gifs)\ntype ContainerScrollProps = {\n  titleComponent: string | React.ReactNode;\n  children: React.ReactNode; // Added children prop\n};\n\nexport const ContainerScroll = ({\n  titleComponent,\n  children, // Destructure children\n}: ContainerScrollProps) => {\n  const containerRef = useRef<any>(null)\n  const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({\n    target: containerRef,\n  })\n  const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = React.useState(false)\n\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    const checkMobile = () => {\n      setIsMobile(window.innerWidth <= 768)\n    }\n    checkMobile()\n    window.addEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\n    return () => {\n      window.removeEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\n    }\n  }, [])\n\n  const scaleDimensions = () => {\n    return isMobile ?

The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence is not just another technological shift; it represents a fundamental change in the means of intellectual and creative production. This power can either be concentrated in the hands of a few, leading to a future of digital serfdom, or it can be distributed, sparking a renaissance of individual capability and decentralized innovation.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Our mission is to champion the latter. We are dedicated to building the tools and cultivating the mindset for the **Citizen Architect**—an individual empowered by AI to conceive, design, and construct complex systems that were previously the exclusive domain of large organizations.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>Our Diagnosis: The Fissured Workplace is a Strategic Threat</h2>\n        <p>\n            The current Western AI development model is built on a brittle foundation. The \"fissured workplace\" creates a global \"ghost workforce\" of data annotators and content moderators, characterized by economic precarity and cognitive strain. This is not just an ethical failure; it is a critical strategic blunder. It degrades the quality of our foundational AI models and creates a vast, undefended attack surface for our adversaries. A system that devalues its human capital cannot lead in an era defined by cognitive competition.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>Our Counter-Strategy: Cognitive Apprenticeship & Vibe Coding</h2>\n        <p>\n            We believe the American counter-strategy must be asymmetric, leveraging our unique culture of bottom-up innovation. We champion a new model of learning and building:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <strong>Vibe Coding:</strong> An intuitive, creative partnership with AI where the human acts as the visionary and the AI as the tireless executor. It's about translating a high-level \"vibe\" into functional, beautiful systems. We aim to be the \"OG vibe coders,\" sharing this powerful workflow with the world.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <strong>Cognitive Apprenticeship:</strong> A model for scaling expertise. We must make the implicit thought processes of expert builders explicit and teachable.

Overview and Goal\n\nThe vision for aiascent.dev is to create a living testament to the capabilities of the DCE. A core part of this is showcasing complex, interactive components built with the tool. This document outlines the plan to port the sophisticated \"AI Ascent Report Viewer\" from the `aiascentgame` project and integrate it as the primary content delivery system for this website.\n\nThe goal is to create a reusable, data-driven component that can display different reports across multiple pages, starting with \"The Ascent Report\" on the Showcase page.\n\n## 2. Curator Instructions: Asset Placement\n\nTo begin this process, the curator needs to place the necessary data and asset files into the project structure.\n\n1.  **Report Data:**\n    *   Place `reportContent.json` and `imageManifest.json` into the `public/data/reports/` directory. Create this directory if it doesn't exist.\n    *   These files will contain the structured text and image metadata for \"The Ascent Report.\"\n\n2.  **Report Images:**\n    *   Copy the entire `report-3` image directory from `aiascentgame`'s `public/images/report-assets/` folder.\n    *   Place it into this project's `public/images/report-assets/` directory. The final path should be `public/images/report-assets/report-3/`.\n\n3.  **Embeddings (for \"Ask Ascentia\" feature):**\n    *   Place `report_faiss.index` and `report_chunks.json` into the `public/` directory.\n\n## 3. Phased Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Component Porting and Adaptation (Cycle 12)\n\n-   **Goal:** Get the core report viewer components running within the `aiascent-dev` project.\n-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Create Directory:** Create a new directory: `src/components/report/`.\n    2.  **Copy Files:** Copy the following files from `context/aiascentgame/report/` into `src/components/report/`:\n        *   `ReportViewerModal.tsx` -> `ReportViewer.tsx` (Rename, as it won't always be a modal)\n        *   `reportStore.ts`\n        *   `ReportTreeNav.tsx`\n        *   `ReportProgressBar.tsx`\n        *   `PageNavigator.tsx`\n        *   `ImageNavigator.tsx`\n        *   `PromptNavigator.tsx`\n        *   `AudioControls.tsx`\n        *   `ReportChatPanel.tsx`\n    3.  **Refactor & Adapt:**\n        *   Update all relative import paths within the copied components.\n        *   Convert any specific styling logic (e.g., from a custom CSS solution) to use TailwindCSS classes to match the `aiascent-dev` aesthetic.\n        *   Modify the `reportStore.ts` to fetch data from `/data/reports/reportContent.json` and `/data/reports/imageManifest.json`.\n        *   Ensure all dependencies (like `react-icons`, `zustand`, etc.) are added to `package.json`.\n\n### Phase 2: Showcase Page Integration (Cycle 13)\n\n-   **Goal:** Display the full, interactive \"Ascent Report\" on the `/showcase` page.\n-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Update `showcase/page.tsx`:** Import the new `ReportViewer` component.\n    2.  **Implement Layout:** Create a client component wrapper (`<ShowcaseClient />`) that initializes the `reportStore` and renders the `ReportViewer`.\n    3.  **Styling:** Ensure the `ReportViewer` component fills the content area of the showcase page appropriately and is fully responsive.\n    4.  **Verification:** Test all functionality: page navigation, image navigation, progress bar, tree navigation, and audio controls.\n\n### Phase 3: Homepage Whitepaper Integration (Cycle 14)\n\n-   **Goal:** Use the report viewer component to display a smaller whitepaper on the homepage.\n-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **(Curator Task):** Create `whitepaperContent.json` and `whitepaperImageManifest.json` in `public/data/reports/`.\n    2.  **Refactor `ReportViewer.tsx`:** Modify the component and its store to accept a data source `prop` (e.g., `reportName=\"ascentReport\"` or `reportName=\"whitepaper\"`). The store's `loadReportData` action will then fetch the corresponding files.\n    3.  **Update `WorkflowSection.tsx`:** Replace the static workflow diagram with the refactored `ReportViewer` component, passing the \"whitepaper\" prop.\n    4.  **Styling:** Adjust the component's styling to fit seamlessly within the homepage layout, potentially with a simplified UI (e.g., hiding the tree nav by default).\n\n### Phase 4: Learn Page Curriculum (Cycle 15+)\n\n-   **Goal:** Create a multi-report hub on the `/learn` page.\n-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Create Report Selection UI:** Build a UI on `/learn` that lists available reports/lessons.\n    2.  **State Management:** Clicking a lesson will set the active `reportName` in the `reportStore`.\n    3.  **Render Viewer:** The `ReportViewer` component will then load and display the selected report's content.\n-   **Outcome:** A flexible educational platform for delivering curriculum through the interactive report viewer.\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md\">\n# Artifact A4: aiascent.dev - Universal Task Checklist\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C11 (Add Report Viewer tasks, complete visual fixes)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A structured checklist for tracking development tasks, feedback, and bugs for the aiascent.dev project, organized by file packages and complexity.\n  - **Tags:** checklist, task management, planning, roadmap\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the extensive feedback and new feature requests from Cycle 11. My course of action is multi-faceted, prioritizing visual bug fixes, creating new pages to resolve 404 errors, and laying the groundwork for the major new feature: the AI Ascent Report Viewer.\n\nFirst, I will address the critical visual issues. This includes fixing the problematic light mode color scheme across the entire site to ensure readability and aesthetic coherence, as well as correcting the styling of the `pcp.gif` in the Hero section to remove the white border and expand its size for better visibility.\n\nNext, I will create the missing pages for \"Mission\" and \"Learn\" to resolve the 404 errors. The Mission page will be built out with content reflecting the project's strategic vision, while the Learn page will be established as a placeholder for future educational content.\n\nFinally, I will create a detailed planning artifact, `A20`, to outline the process of porting the complex AI Ascent Report Viewer into the Showcase page. This plan will define the new file structure, data placement, and the necessary code modifications to integrate the viewer, providing a clear roadmap for this significant feature implementation in the subsequent cycle.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Fix Light Mode Theme:**\n    *   **`src/app/globals.css`:** I will introduce a comprehensive set of CSS variables for the light theme to fix the harsh color combinations. This includes defining new colors for background, foreground (text), cards, borders, and primary/accent elements to ensure a soft, readable, and professional light mode experience.\n    *   **`src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** I will adjust the styling of the workflow step boxes to use the new light mode variables, ensuring the text inside is visible.\n    *   **`src/components/global/lamp.tsx` & `sparkles.tsx`:** I will modify the `SparklesCore` component to dynamically change the particle color based on the theme, switching to a subtle gray for light mode to avoid clashing with the background.\n    *   **`src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** The image borders will be updated to use the new light mode border color.\n\n2.  **Fix Hero Section GIF:**\n    *   **`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** I will modify the `ContainerScroll` component's child `div`. The white background will be removed, and I will increase the scale of the GIF container within the animation to make it larger and more prominent, eliminating the white border and improving visibility as requested.\n\n3.  **Create New Pages:**\n    *   **`src/app/mission/page.tsx` (New File):** I will create the Mission page, structuring its content based on the blueprint in `A19`. It will have a clear title and sections explaining the project's strategic vision.\n    *   **`src/app/learn/page.tsx` (New File):** I will create a placeholder page for the Learn section with a title and a message indicating that content is coming soon. This resolves the 404 error and sets the stage for future development.\n\n4.  **Plan Report Viewer Integration:**\n    *   **`src/Artifacts/A20. aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Porting Plan.md` (New File):** I will create this new planning artifact. It will serve as a detailed blueprint for integrating the report viewer from the `aiascentgame` context. The plan will specify:\n        *   The target directory for the report viewer components (`src/components/report/`).\n        *   The location for report data (`public/data/reports/`) and assets (`public/assets/images/report-assets/`).\n        *   The plan for a new Zustand store (`src/lib/stores/reportStore.ts`).\n        *   A list of required modifications, such as removing the voting system.\n    *   **`src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md`:** I will update the master list to include the new `A20` artifact.\n\n5.  **Update Documentation:**\n    *   **`src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`:** I will update the checklist to reflect the completion of previous tasks and add new tasks for the current cycle's work.\n    *   **`src/Artifacts/A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md`:** I will update the roadmap to include the major new task of implementing the full interactive report viewer on the showcase page.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/globals.css\">\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer base {\n  :root {\n    --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --popover: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --popover-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --primary: 217.2 91.2% 59.8%;\n    --primary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;\n    --secondary: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --secondary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --muted: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --muted-foreground: 215 20.2% 65.1%;\n    --accent: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --accent-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --destructive: 0 62.8% 30.6%;\n    --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --border: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --input: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n    --ring: 224.3 76.3% 48%;\n    --radius: 0.5rem;\n  }\n\n  .light {\n    --background: 0 0% 100%;\n    --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --card: 0 0% 100%;\n    --card-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --popover: 0 0% 100%;\n    --popover-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n    --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;\n    --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --secondary: 210 40% 96.1%;\n    --secondary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;\n    --muted: 210 40% 96.1%;\n    --muted-foreground: 215.4 16.3% 46.9%;\n    --accent: 210 40% 96.1%;\n    --accent-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;\n    --destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%;\n    --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    --border: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;\n    --input: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;\n    --ring: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer base {\n  * {\n    @apply border-border;\n  }\n  body {\n    @apply bg-background text-foreground;\n  }\n}\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\">\n// src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx\n// C11 - Enlarge GIF and remove white border artifacts\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ContainerScroll } from '@/components/global/container-scroll-animation';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nconst HeroSection = () => {\n  return (\n    <section className=\"min-h-screen w-full bg-background dark:bg-neutral-950 rounded-md !overflow-visible relative flex flex-col items-center antialiased\">\n      {/* Background Gradient */}\n      <div className=\"absolute inset-0 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#fff_35%,#F5F5F5_100%)] dark:[background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_35%,#0D1A26_100%)]\"></div>\n\n      {/* ContainerScroll and Content */}\n      <div className=\"flex flex-col mt-[-50px] md:mt-0\">\n        <ContainerScroll\n          titleComponent={\n            <div className=\"flex items-center flex-col\">\n              {/* Headline (A16, 4.2) */}\n              <h1 className=\"text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-neutral-800 to-neutral-500 dark:from-white dark:to-neutral-600 font-sans font-bold text-center mb-8 pt-16\">\n                Master the Human-AI Workflow.

The current Western approach to AI labor—the \"fissured workplace\"—has created a vast, unseen engine of data annotators characterized by economic precarity and cognitive burden. This structure is not merely a labor issue; it is a critical and escalating national security vulnerability. It systematically degrades the quality of foundational AI data, creates a vast and undefended attack surface for adversarial manipulation, and cedes strategic ground to competitors who have recognized the profound importance of human capital in the AI era.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n\n        <section className=\"mb-12\">\n          <h2 className=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">Our Counter-Strategy: Cognitive Capitalism</h2>\n          <p className=\"text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n            Our strategy is to foster \"Cognitive Capitalism\"—a system where the means of intellectual production are decentralized, and individuals are empowered to leverage AI to create value. We believe an army of empowered \"Citizen Architects\" is the most viable counter-strategy to centralized AI power.

It is not just a productivity tool, but the foundational infrastructure for enabling this vision. It provides the structured workflow, auditability, and efficiency needed for decentralized, high-quality AI development. It transforms the chaotic process of \"vibe coding\" on a stream into a rigorous, repeatable, and scalable methodology—a form of cognitive apprenticeship for the AI era.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n\n        <section className=\"text-center\">\n          <h2 className=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">Join the Ascent</h2>\n          <p className=\"text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mx-auto\">\n            We invite developers to adopt the tools, educators to teach the methodology, and leaders to support the vision.

Purpose and Goal\n\nThis document provides a clear, step-by-step plan for integrating the complex, interactive AI Ascent Report Viewer from the `aiascentgame` project into the `/showcase` page of `aiascent.dev`. The goal is to create a high-fidelity demonstration of a complex component built with the DCE, serving as the centerpiece of the website's showcase.\n\n## 2. File and Data Placement Strategy\n\n### 2.1. Component Structure\n\nAll report viewer-related React components will be placed in a new, dedicated directory.\n\n-   **Source:** `context/aiascentgame/report/`\n-   **Destination:** `src/components/report/`\n\nThis includes: `AudioControls.tsx`, `ImageNavigator.tsx`, `PageNavigator.tsx`, `PromptNavigator.tsx`, `ReportChatPanel.tsx`, `ReportProgressBar.tsx`, `ReportTreeNav.tsx`, and `ReportViewerModal.tsx`.\n\n### 2.2. State Management\n\nA new Zustand store will be created to manage the state of the report viewer, keeping it decoupled from any other site state.\n\n-   **Source:** `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`\n-   **Destination:** `src/lib/stores/reportStore.ts`\n\n### 2.3. Data and Assets (Curator Action)\n\nThe curator will need to place the report's content and visual assets in the `public` directory according to the following structure. This answers the user's question about where to place these files.\n\n1.  **Report Content JSON:**\n    *   **Source File:** `context/aiascentgame/reportContent.json`\n    *   **Destination Path:** `public/data/reports/reportContent.json`\n\n2.  **Report Image Assets:**\n    *   **Source Directory:** (Curator's local file system)\n    *   **Destination Path:** `public/assets/images/report-assets/`\n    *   The internal structure should follow the pattern defined in the `aiascentgame` artifacts (e.g., `report-3/section-id/page-id/prompt-id/image.webp`).\n\n3.  **Report Embeddings (for \"Ask Ascentia\" feature):**\n    *   **Source Files:** (Curator's local file system: `report_faiss.index`, `report_chunks.json`)\n    *   **Destination Path:** `public/data/reports/`\n\n## 3. Implementation Plan\n\n### Step 1: File Migration\n\n1.  Create the `src/components/report/` directory.\n2.  Copy all `.tsx` component files from `context/aiascentgame/report/` into the new directory.\n3.  Create the `src/lib/stores/` directory.\n4.  Copy `reportStore.ts` into it.\n5.  (Curator) Create `public/data/reports/` and place `reportContent.json` inside.\n6.  (Curator) Create `public/assets/images/report-assets/` and place the image folders inside.\n\n### Step 2: Code Refactoring and Adaptation\n\n1.  **Update Imports:** Go through all copied components and the new `reportStore.ts` to update all relative import paths to match the new project structure.\n2.  **Remove Voting System:** This is a key requirement.\n    *   In `reportStore.ts`: Remove the `imageVotes`, `votesCastByPage`, `castVote`, `voteWithKeyboard`, and `jumpToNextUnvotedPage` state and actions.\n    *   In `ImageNavigator.tsx`: Remove the \"Votes Left!\" and \"Vote\" buttons, and all associated logic.\n3.  **Remove Next-Auth Dependency:** The `ImageNavigator.tsx` component uses `useSession` from `next-auth/react` to check if a user can vote. Since this site has no user authentication, this dependency must be removed.\n4.  **Adapt Styling:** The components from `aiascentgame` use inline styles. These should be reviewed and potentially converted to Tailwind CSS classes where appropriate to better align with the `aiascent.dev` project's styling conventions. For the initial port, they can be kept as-is to ensure functionality.\n5.  **Remove \"Ask Ascentia\":** The \"Ask Ascentia\" feature depends on a backend with a socket server and a RAG implementation that does not exist in this project. For the initial port, this feature will be disabled to reduce complexity.\n    *   In `ImageNavigator.tsx`: Remove the \"Ask\" button.\n    *   In `ReportViewerModal.tsx`: Remove the `ReportChatPanel` component and related logic.\n    *   In `reportStore.ts`: Remove all chat-related state (`reportChatHistory`, `isChatPanelOpen`, etc.).\n\n### Step 3: Showcase Page Integration\n\n1.  **Modify `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:**\n2.  Clear out the existing placeholder `InteractiveWhitepaper` component.\n3.  Create a new main component, `ReportViewerClient`, which will be a client component (`'use client'`).\n4.  This `ReportViewerClient` will import and render the main `ReportViewerModal.tsx` component. This is necessary because the report viewer and its store rely heavily on client-side state and hooks.\n5.  The main `ShowcasePage` will render `<ReportViewerClient />`.\n\n### Step 4: Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)\n\n-   **\"Ask Ascentia\":** Re-implementing this would require a new backend service (e.g., a Next.js API route) to handle the RAG logic.\n-   **Reusable Viewer:** Refactor the `ReportViewerModal` to accept a `reportId` prop, allowing it to be reused on the homepage and learn page with different data sources.\n</file_artifact>"

          "content": "I have analyzed the extensive feedback and requests from Cycle 11. My course of action is to address the immediate visual bugs in the hero section and light mode, create the initial scaffolding for the missing pages to resolve the 404 errors, and then update our planning documentation to outline the major task of porting the interactive report viewer.\n\nHere is the detailed plan:\n\n1.  **Fix Light Mode Theme:** I will implement a complete and coherent light mode color palette by updating the root CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css`. This will provide a professional, high-contrast theme. I will then make targeted adjustments to fix specific component issues:\n    *   **Features Section:** The dark image borders and backgrounds will be updated to match the light theme.\n    *   **Workflow Section:** The text color within the workflow steps will be corrected to ensure visibility.\n    *   **Mission Section:** The particle color for the `SparklesCore` component will be changed from white to a dark gray in light mode to prevent it from clashing with the background.\n\n2.  **Fix Hero Section `pcp.gif`:** I will address the two issues with the main animation:\n    *   The white border will be removed by changing the background color of its container in `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx` to be transparent.\n    *   The GIF will be made significantly larger to improve visibility of its details by adjusting the sizing and padding constraints within the `ContainerScroll` component and its parent in `HeroSection.tsx`.\n\n3.  **Scaffold New Pages:** To resolve the 404 errors, I will create the basic page files for `/mission` and `/learn` (`src/app/mission/page.tsx` and `src/app/learn/page.tsx`), populating them with placeholder content based on their respective design documents (A19 and A18).\n\n4.  **Update Documentation & Plan Report Viewer Port:** I will bring our project planning up to date.\n    *   I will update the **Universal Task Checklist (A4)** and **Implementation Roadmap (A11)** to reflect the current status and future plans.\n    *   I will create a new artifact, **A20: aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Porting Plan**, to formally document the strategy for integrating the report viewer components from the `aiascentgame` context. This plan will cover file placement, dependencies, data migration, and necessary component refactoring.\n    *   Finally, I will update the **Master Artifact List (A0)** to include this new planning document.\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/app/globals.css`:** Define a new, complete set of CSS variables for the light theme (`:root`) to ensure high contrast and readability across the site.\n2.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** Modify the styling of the feature containers to use theme-aware border and background colors, ensuring they look correct in both light and dark modes.\n3.  **Update `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** Adjust the styling of the workflow step containers to use theme-aware colors so the text is always legible.\n4.  **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** Use the `useTheme` hook from `next-themes` to detect the current theme and dynamically pass a dark particle color (`#000000`) to the `SparklesCore` component when in light mode, and white (`#FFFFFF`) in dark mode.\n5.  **Update `src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx`:** Remove the hardcoded `bg-gray-100` from the `Card` component's inner div to eliminate the white border around the `pcp.gif`. I will also increase the `max-w-5xl` to `max-w-7xl` to allow the container to be larger.\n6.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Remove the white border around the `pcp.gif` that appears in light mode by adjusting background colors.\n7.  **Create `src/app/mission/page.tsx`:** Create the file for the Mission page with placeholder content based on A19 to resolve the 404 error.\n8.  **Create `src/app/learn/page.tsx`:** Create the file for the Learn page with placeholder content based on A18 to resolve the 404 error.\n9.  **Create `src/Artifacts/A20-Report-Viewer-Porting-Plan.md`:** Create a new planning artifact detailing the steps to port the report viewer from the `aiascentgame` project.\n10. **Update `src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md`:** Add the new A20 artifact to the master list.\n11. **Update `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`:** Update the checklist to reflect the completion of recent tasks and add new tasks for the report viewer integration.\n12. **Update `src/Artifacts/A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md`:** Update the implementation roadmap to align with the current project status and future goals.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/globals.css\">\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer base {\n:root {\n--background: 210 40% 98%;\n--foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n\n--card: 210 40% 96.1%;\n--card-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n\n--popover: 210 40% 98%;\n--popover-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n\n--primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;\n--primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n--secondary: 210 40% 96.1%;\n--secondary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;\n\n--muted: 210 40% 96.1%;\n--muted-foreground: 215.4 16.3% 46.9%;\n\n--accent: 210 40% 96.1%;\n--accent-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;\n\n--destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%;\n--destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n--border: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;\n--input: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;\n--ring: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;\n\n--radius: 0.5rem;\n\n\n}\n\n.dark {\n--background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n--foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n--card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n--card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n--popover: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n--popover-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n--primary: 217.2 91.2% 59.8%;\n--primary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;\n\n--secondary: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n--secondary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n--muted: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n--muted-foreground: 215 20.2% 65.1%;\n\n--accent: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n--accent-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n--destructive: 0 62.8% 30.6%;\n--destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n\n--border: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n--input: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;\n--ring: 224.3 76.3% 48%;\n\n\n}\n}\n\n@layer base {\n\n  * {\n    @apply border-border;\n    }\n    body {\n    @apply bg-background text-foreground;\n    }\n    }\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx\">\n// src/components/global/container-scroll-animation.tsx\n// C11 - Remove background color from card and increase max-width\n'use client'\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react'\nimport { useScroll, useTransform, motion } from 'framer-motion'\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\n// Define the type for the children prop, which will contain the visuals (images/gifs)\ntype ContainerScrollProps = {\ntitleComponent: string | React.ReactNode;\nchildren: React.ReactNode; // Added children prop\n};\n\nexport const ContainerScroll = ({\ntitleComponent,\nchildren, // Destructure children\n}: ContainerScrollProps) => {\nconst containerRef = useRef<any>(null)\nconst { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({\ntarget: containerRef,\n})\nconst [isMobile, setIsMobile] = React.useState(false)\n\nReact.useEffect(() => {\nconst checkMobile = () => {\nsetIsMobile(window.innerWidth <= 768)\n}\ncheckMobile()\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\nreturn () => {\nwindow.removeEventListener('resize', checkMobile)\n}\n}, [])\n\nconst scaleDimensions = () => {\nreturn isMobile ?

Overview & Goal\n\nThe primary goal is to integrate the sophisticated, interactive report viewer from the `aiascent.game` project into the `aiascent.dev` website. This component will be the centerpiece of the `/showcase` page, demonstrating the capabilities of the DCE. It must be ported in a way that makes it reusable for other sections of the site, such as the homepage and the `/learn` section, which will display different report data through the same UI.\n\n## 2. Phased Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: File & Dependency Migration\n\n-   **Goal:** Move the necessary source code and data into the `aiascent.dev` project and install required dependencies.\n-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Code Placement:**\n        -   Create a new directory: `src/components/showcase/report-viewer/`.\n        -   Copy all files from `context/aiascentgame/report/` into this new directory.\n    2.  **Data & Asset Placement (Curator Action):**\n        -   Create `public/data/report/`. The curator will place `reportContent.json` and `imageManifest.json` here.\n        -   Create `public/assets/images/report/`. The curator will place the corresponding report images here, maintaining the directory structure (`report-3/s01/p01/...`).\n    3.  **Dependency Installation:**\n        -   Review the `package.json` and component files from `aiascentgame` to identify necessary libraries.\n        -   Install the required dependencies. Based on the source files, these will include:\n            ```bash\n            npm install zustand re-resizable react-icons\n            ```\n\n### Phase 2: Component Refactoring & Integration\n\n-   **Goal:** Adapt the `ReportViewerModal.tsx` to be a reusable, embeddable component and integrate it into the `/showcase` page.\n-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Component Adaptation:**\n        -   Rename `src/components/showcase/report-viewer/ReportViewerModal.tsx` to `ReportViewer.tsx`.\n        -   Remove the modal-specific logic (e.g., the full-screen overlay, the `useUIStore` dependency for opening/closing). The component should be a self-contained `div` that can be placed within a page layout.\n        -   The `onClose` functionality should be removed or repurposed.\n    2.  **State Management:**\n        -   The `reportStore.ts` file can be moved to a more central location like `src/lib/store/reportStore.ts`.\n        -   The store's logic for loading data (`loadReportData`) must be updated to fetch from the new path: `/data/report/reportContent.json`.\n    3.  **Showcase Page Integration:**\n        -   Modify `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`.\n        -   Import and render the new `<ReportViewer />` component.\n        -   The page should contain a `useEffect` hook that calls the `loadReportData` action from the `reportStore` when the component mounts.\n\n### Phase 3: Styling & Theming\n\n-   **Goal:** Ensure the report viewer's styling is consistent with the `aiascent.dev` theme, including light and dark modes.\n-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Refactor Inline Styles:** The source components use a significant amount of inline `React.CSSProperties`. These should be progressively refactored to use TailwindCSS classes and the site's theme variables (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`, etc.).\n    2.  **Light Mode Compatibility:** Pay special attention to hardcoded colors (e.g., `#ccc`, `rgba(0,0,0,0.3)`) and replace them with theme-aware Tailwind classes to ensure the component is fully functional in light mode.\n    3.  **Icon Library:** Ensure `react-icons` works correctly and icons are styled appropriately.\n\n### Phase 4: Reusability & Data Loading Abstraction\n\n-   **Goal:** Make the component capable of loading different reports.\n-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Props for Data:** Modify the `<ReportViewer />` component and the `reportStore` to accept props that specify which report files to load (e.g., `<ReportViewer contentPath=\"/data/report/whitepaper.json\" />`).\n    2.  **Store Reset:** Implement a mechanism to reset or re-initialize the `reportStore` when switching between different reports to prevent state leakage. This will be crucial for the `/learn` page, where users can switch between different lessons.\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\">\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C11 (Add A20 Report Viewer Porting Plan)\n\n## 1.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the extensive feedback and new feature requests. My plan is to address the immediate visual bugs, update all relevant documentation to reflect the new scope, and then begin scaffolding and implementing the major new features, including the Mission page and the porting of the AI Ascent Report Viewer.\n\nThis is a comprehensive update that will touch on styling, component implementation, and project planning.\n\n\n### Course of Action:\n\n1.  **Documentation First:**\n    *   Create a new planning artifact, `A20. aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan`, to outline the strategy for porting the report viewer from the `aiascentgame` context. This will define the new file structure (`src/components/report-viewer/`, `src/stores/reportStore.ts`) and asset locations (`public/data/`, `public/assets/images/report/`).\n    *   Update the `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md` to include the new `A20` artifact.\n    *   Update the `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` to reflect the new tasks for this cycle, including fixing the hero section GIF, implementing the light mode theme, creating the Mission page, and porting the report viewer.\n    *   Update the `A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md` to incorporate these new, more granular tasks.\n\n2.  **Fix Homepage Visuals:**\n    *   **Hero Section GIF:** In `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`, I will remove the white background from the `ContainerScroll` component's card, allowing the dark theme to show through. I will also expand the `pcp.gif` to fill more of the container, making its details more visible as requested.\n    *   **Light Mode Theme:** I will implement a full light mode theme by adding new CSS variables to `src/app/globals.css`. This will involve defining a light color palette for backgrounds, text, borders, and accents. I will then apply these variables using Tailwind's `light:` variants across all relevant components (`FeaturesSection.tsx`, `WorkflowSection.tsx`, `lamp.tsx`, etc.) to fix issues with readability, contrast, and clashing colors. The particle colors in the `lamp.tsx` component will be inverted for light mode.\n\n3.  **Implement New Pages:**\n    *   **Mission Page:** Create the new page at `src/app/mission/page.tsx`. I will populate this page with content based on the blueprint in `A19` and the user's narrative about \"cognitive apprenticeship,\" the \"fissured workplace,\" and becoming \"solarpunk prime.\"\n    *   **Learn & Showcase Pages:** Create placeholder pages for `/learn` and update `/showcase` to resolve the 404 errors and prepare them for the integration of the report viewer component.\n\n4.  **Scaffold the Report Viewer:**\n    *   Create the new directory `src/components/report-viewer/` and copy the component files from the `context/aiascentgame/report/` directory into it.\n    *   Create the new Zustand store at `src/stores/reportStore.ts` using the provided context file.\n    *   I will then begin the process of adapting the code, starting with the main `ReportViewer` component, to function within the `aiascent.dev` project.\n\n5.  **Dependency Management:**\n    *   Add `react-icons` to the `package.json` as it is a required dependency for the ported report viewer components.\n\nA curator activity section is included with instructions for managing new dependencies and placing the necessary data and image assets for the report viewer.\n</summary>\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create `A20. aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan.md`:** A new artifact to document the plan for porting the report viewer components and assets.\n2.  **Update `A0-Master-Artifact-List.md`:** Add the new `A20` artifact to the master list.\n3.  **Update `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`:** Add new tasks for fixing visuals (T-7, T-8), implementing the Mission page (T-9), porting the report viewer (T-10), and creating the Learn page shell (T-11).\n4.  **Update `A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md`:** Revise the roadmap to include the new feature implementations and fixes.\n5.  **Update `package.json`:** Add `react-icons` as a dependency.\n6.  **Update `src/app/globals.css`:** Define a complete set of CSS variables for a new light theme to address all reported visual issues with colors and readability.\n7.  **Update `tailwind.config.ts`:** Add light-mode variants for particle colors in the `lamp` component.\n8.  **Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:** Remove the white background behind the `pcp.gif` and adjust its sizing to be larger and more detailed.\n9.  **Update `src/components/home/FeaturesSection.tsx`:** Add `light:` variants for borders to improve appearance in light mode.\n10. **Update `src/components/home/WorkflowSection.tsx`:** Add `light:` variants for background and text colors to ensure visibility.\n11. **Update `src/components/global/lamp.tsx`:** Add `light:` variants to invert the lamp effect and change particle colors for better visibility on a light background.\n12. **Create `src/app/mission/page.tsx`:** Create the new Mission page with content derived from `A19` and the user's prompt.\n13. **Create `src/app/learn/page.tsx`:** Create a placeholder page to resolve the 404.\n14. **Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** Replace the existing content with a placeholder, preparing it for the new report viewer component.\n15. **Create `src/components/report-viewer/` directory:** Copy all report viewer component files from `context/aiascentgame/report/` into this new directory.\n16. **Create `src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** Copy the `reportStore.ts` content from the context into this new file to manage the state for the report viewer.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\n1.  **Install New Dependency:** Run `npm install react-icons` or `yarn add react-icons` to add the new dependency required by the ported report viewer components.\n2.  **Copy Report Data:**\n    *   Copy the file from `context/aiascentgame/reportContent.json`.\n    *   Create a new directory `public/data/`.\n    *   Paste the file into the new directory and rename it to `ai_ascent_report.json`.\n3.  **Copy Report Images:**\n    *   You will need the image assets that correspond to the `ai_ascent_report.json` file.\n    *   Create a new directory structure: `public/assets/images/report/`.\n    *   Copy the entire image directory structure for the report into this new location. The final paths should match the URLs that will be generated from the data file (e.g., `public/assets/images/report/report-3/s01/p01/...`).\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A20. aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan.md\">\n# Artifact A20: aiascent.dev - Report Viewer Integration Plan\n\n# Date Created: C11\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n- **Key/Value for A0:**\n- **Description:** A detailed plan for porting the \"AI Ascent Report Viewer\" from the `aiascentgame` context into the `aiascent.dev` project to serve as the primary component for the Showcase, Learn, and Home pages.\n- **Tags:** report viewer, integration plan, porting, showcase, learn, component, architecture\n\n## 1. Overview and Goal\n\nThe goal of this initiative is to integrate a feature-rich, interactive report viewer into the `aiascent.dev` website. This component, originally developed for the `aiascent.game` project, will be repurposed to display \"The Ascent Report\" on the `/showcase` page, a smaller whitepaper on the homepage, and future educational content on the `/learn` page. This plan outlines the technical strategy for porting, adapting, and integrating the component and its associated assets.\n\n## 2. Technical Strategy\n\nThe porting process will involve migrating the React components, Zustand state management, and data/image assets into the `aiascent.dev` project structure.\n\n### 2.1. Component and State Management Migration\n\n*   **Components Directory:** A new directory will be created at `src/components/report-viewer/` to house all the ported React components (`.tsx` files) from `context/aiascentgame/report/`.\n    *   The main component, `ReportViewerModal.tsx`, will be adapted to be a standard page component (`ReportViewer.tsx`) rather than a modal.\n*   **State Management:** A new Zustand store will be created at `src/stores/reportStore.ts`. The code from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts` will be copied here. This store will manage the complex state of the report viewer, including page navigation, image selection, and chat functionality.\n*   **Dependencies:** The `react-icons` library is a required dependency for the components and must be added to `package.json`.\n\n### 2.2. Data and Asset Placement\n\nTo ensure the component can load its content, the following directory structure must be established by the curator.\n\n*   **Report Data (JSON):**\n    *   **Location:** `public/data/`\n    *   **File:** The `reportContent.json` from the `aiascentgame` context will be copied to this directory and renamed to `ai_ascent_report.json`. This will be the primary data source for the `/showcase` page.\n*   **Report Images:**\n    *   **Location:** `public/assets/images/report/`\n    *   **Structure:** The entire directory of images associated with the report must be copied here. The file paths within this directory must align with the URLs constructed by the logic in `reportStore.ts` (e.g., `/assets/images/report/report-3/...`).\n\n## 3. Implementation Plan\n\n1.  **Phase 1: Scaffolding and File Placement (This Cycle)**\n    *   Create the `src/components/report-viewer/` and `src/stores/` directories.\n    *   Copy all relevant component and store files from the `context/` directory.\n    *   Create the placeholder pages for `/showcase` and `/learn`.\n    *   Instruct the curator to add dependencies and place the data/image assets in the `public/` directory.\n\n2.  **Phase 2: Component Adaptation**\n    *   Refactor `ReportViewerModal.tsx` into a standard `ReportViewer.tsx` component that can be embedded directly into a page.\n    *   Update all import paths within the ported components to reflect the new project structure.\n    *   Modify the data-loading logic in `reportStore.ts` to fetch from the new path (`/data/ai_ascent_report.json`).\n    *   Adjust image URL construction logic if necessary to point to `/assets/images/report/...`.\n\n3.  **Phase 3: Integration**\n    *   Embed the fully adapted `ReportViewer.tsx` component into the `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`.\n    *   Thoroughly test all functionality: page navigation, image cycling, and interactivity.\n\n4.  **Phase 4: Reusability for Homepage and Learn Page**\n    *   Refactor the `ReportViewer.tsx` and `reportStore.ts` to accept a `reportId` or data source URL as a prop. This will allow the same component to load different reports (e.g., the main report on `/showcase` vs. the whitepaper on the homepage). This is a future task.\n</file_artifact>\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A0-Master-Artifact-List.md\">\n# Artifact A0: aiascent.dev - Master Artifact List\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C11 (Add new A20 artifact for Report Viewer)\n\n## 1.

I have been provided with the necessary data files (`ai_ascent_report.json`, `imageManifest.json`) and the associated report images.\n\nMy course of action is to port the complete report viewer functionality from the `aiascentgame` context into the `aiascent.dev` project. This involves adapting the Zustand state management, porting all the React components, and integrating them into the `/showcase` page.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Install Dependencies:** I will add the `zustand` library to `package.json` as it is a core dependency for the report viewer's state management.\n\n2.  **Implement State Management:** I will fully implement `src/stores/reportStore.ts` by copying the logic from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`. This includes:\n    *   Defining the complete state shape for the report viewer (current page, image indices, visibility toggles, etc.).\n    *   Implementing the data loading logic to fetch and merge `ai_ascent_report.json` and `imageManifest.json`.\n    *   Correcting the image paths during data reconstruction to match the project's `/public/assets/images/report/` directory structure.\n    *   Adding all necessary actions for navigation, interaction, and state updates.\n\n3.  **Port All Report Viewer Components:** I will replace the placeholder content in each of the `src/components/report-viewer/` files with the complete, functional code from the `aiascentgame` context. This includes:\n    *   `ReportViewer.tsx` (adapted from `ReportViewerModal.tsx` to be an embeddable page component).\n    *   `ReportTreeNav.tsx`\n    *   `PageNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `ReportProgressBar.tsx`\n    *   `ImageNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `AudioControls.tsx` (as a placeholder for now)\n    *   `PromptNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `ReportChatPanel.tsx` (as a placeholder for now)\n    *   I will ensure all component imports are updated to reflect the new file structure.\n\n4.  **Integrate into Showcase Page:** I will update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to:\n    *   Use the `'use client'` directive, as the report viewer is a stateful, interactive component.\n    *   Import and render the main `ReportViewer` component, replacing the current \"Loading...\"

          "content": "<summary>\nI will implement the AI Ascent Report Viewer on the showcase page. The core of this task involves porting the functional components and state management logic from the `aiascentgame` context into the `aiascent.dev` project, replacing the existing placeholder files.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Add Dependencies:** I will update `package.json` to include `zustand` for state management and `re-resizable` for creating resizable panels within the viewer, which are required by the source components.\n2.  **Implement State Management:** I will port the complete `reportStore.ts` from the `aiascentgame` context. This Zustand store is the engine of the report viewer. I will adapt its data loading logic to fetch `ai_ascent_report.json` and `imageManifest.json` from their new locations in the `public/data` directory. Crucially, I will adjust the image URL construction logic to correctly point to the `public/assets/images/report/` directory.\n3.  **Port and Adapt Components:** I will replace the placeholder report viewer components in `src/components/report-viewer/` with their full implementations from the `aiascentgame` context. This includes:\n    *   Creating a main `ReportViewer.tsx` component, adapted from the original `ReportViewerModal.tsx` to function as a standard, embeddable page component rather than a modal.\n    *   Implementing the full logic for `ReportTreeNav.tsx`, `PageNavigator.tsx`, `ImageNavigator.tsx`, `PromptNavigator.tsx`, and `ReportProgressBar.tsx`. The voting functionality in the `ImageNavigator` will be disabled as requested.\n    *   Creating a simple placeholder for the `MarkdownRenderer` to ensure the component renders without errors.\n4.  **Integrate into Showcase Page:** Finally, I will update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to be a client component and embed the newly created `ReportViewer.tsx`, bringing the interactive report to life and replacing the current \"Loading...\" message.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `package.json`:** Add `zustand` and `re-resizable` to the dependencies list.\n2.  **Create `src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** Implement the full Zustand store by porting the code from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`. I will modify the data fetching paths to `/data/ai_ascent_report.json` and `/data/imageManifest.json`. I will also ensure the image URL generation correctly uses the `/assets/images/report/` path.\n3.  **Create `src/components/ui/MarkdownRenderer.tsx`:** Create this new utility component to render markdown content from the report, preventing rendering errors in the main component. For now, it will be a simple component that preserves basic formatting.\n4.  **Create `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`:** Create the main container component, adapting the layout and logic from `context/aiascentgame/report/ReportViewerModal.tsx`. This component will be responsible for initializing the data load and arranging all the sub-components.\n5.  **Update `src/components/report-viewer/ReportTreeNav.tsx`:** Port the full code from the `aiascentgame` context to create the hierarchical navigation tree for the report.\n6.  **Update `src/components/report-viewer/PageNavigator.tsx`:** Port the code to display the current page title and handle top-level navigation controls. I will remove the modal-specific \"close\" button.\n7.  **Update `src/components/report-viewer/ImageNavigator.tsx`:** Port the component responsible for image and prompt navigation. I will keep the UI for the voting button but disable its `onClick` functionality as requested.\n8.  **Update `src/components/report-viewer/PromptNavigator.tsx`:** Port the component that displays the text of the image generation prompt.\n9.  **Update `src/components/report-viewer/ReportProgressBar.tsx`:** Port the component that visualizes the user's viewing progress through the report.\n10. **Update `src/components/report-viewer/ReportChatPanel.tsx`:** To maintain component integrity without implementing the full chat functionality, I will update this to be a simple placeholder that returns `null`.\n11. **Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** Convert this to a client component (`'use client'`) and replace the current placeholder content with the new `<ReportViewer />` component.\n12. **Provide Curator Instructions:** Add a `<curator_activity>` block to remind the curator to run `npm install`.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nPlease run `npm install` in your terminal to install the new `zustand` and `re-resizable` dependencies required for the report viewer.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n```json\n{\n  \"name\":

          "content": "<summary>\nI will implement the AI Ascent Report Viewer on the `/showcase` page. The current page only displays a \"Loading...\" message. My plan is to port the necessary components and state management logic from the `aiascentgame` context, adapt them for this project, and integrate them to create a fully functional, interactive report viewer.\n\nThis involves several key steps:\n1.  **Update Dependencies:** I will add `zustand` for state management and `re-resizable` for adjustable UI panels to the `package.json`.\n2.  **Port and Adapt the State Logic:** I will port the `reportStore.ts` from the `aiascentgame` context. This is the core of the viewer. I will update its data-loading functions to fetch the `ai_ascent_report.json` and `imageManifest.json` files from their correct locations within the `public` directory and ensure the image paths are correctly constructed.\n3.  **Create the Main Report Viewer Component:** I will refactor the original `ReportViewerModal.tsx` into a new, non-modal component named `ReportViewer.tsx`. This will serve as the main container for all the report elements.\n4.  **Port UI Components:** I will port all the child components (`PageNavigator`, `ImageNavigator`, `ReportTreeNav`, etc.) and update their import paths. As requested, I will remove the voting functionality from `ImageNavigator`. I will also provide a simplified version of the `ReportChatPanel` for this cycle, focusing on the core report viewing experience first.\n5.  **Integrate into Showcase Page:** Finally, I will replace the current placeholder content on the `/showcase` page with the new, fully functional `ReportViewer` component.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`package.json`:** Add `zustand` and `re-resizable` as new dependencies to support the ported components.\n2.  **`src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** Replace the placeholder file with the full implementation from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`. I will modify the `loadReportData` function to:\n    *   Fetch data from `/data/ai_ascent_report.json` and `/data/imageManifest.json`.\n    *   Correctly construct image URLs by using a hardcoded base path of `/assets/images/report/` to match the project's asset structure, ignoring the `basePath` from the manifest.\n3.  **`src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx` (New File):** Create this main component by adapting the code from `context/aiascentgame/report/ReportViewerModal.tsx`. I will strip out all modal-specific logic (overlays, close functions tied to a global UI store) and convert it into a self-contained page component that fetches its own data on mount.\n4.  **`src/components/report-viewer/*.tsx` (Update All):** Replace all placeholder component files with their full implementations from the `context/aiascentgame/report/` directory. I will then meticulously update all import paths within these files to point to the new store and component locations.\n5.  **`src/components/report-viewer/ImageNavigator.tsx` (Modification):** As part of the porting process, I will remove the voting system functionality and its related dependencies (`useSession`, `castVote`, etc.) from this component as per the project requirements.\n6.  **`src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** Update the showcase page to be a client component and render the new `<ReportViewer />`, replacing the \"Loading...\" placeholder.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file

          "content": "<summary>\nOkay, Cycle 12. The data and image assets for the AI Ascent Report are in place. My objective is to bring the report viewer to life on the `/showcase` page, replacing the current \"Loading...\" message with the fully interactive component ported from the `aiascentgame` context.\n\nMy course of action is a comprehensive port and adaptation of the report viewer's core components and state management logic. I will systematically replace the placeholder files with their functional counterparts, adjust them for the `aiascent.dev` environment, and integrate them to create a seamless viewing experience.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Install Dependencies:** I will update `package.json` to include `zustand` and `re-resizable`, which are essential for the report viewer's state management and layout.\n\n2.  **Implement State Management:** I will replace the placeholder content of `src/stores/reportStore.ts` with the full, robust logic from the `aiascentgame` context. This involves:\n    *   Adapting the `loadReportData` function to fetch `ai_ascent_report.json` and `imageManifest.json` from their new locations in `/public/data/`.\n    *   Correcting the image `basePath` to `/assets/images/report/` to match the project's asset structure.\n    *   Removing all logic related to the voting system, as requested in the project scope.\n\n3.  **Create the Main Report Viewer Component:** I will create a new primary component, `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`. This component will be adapted from the `ReportViewerModal.tsx` in the `aiascentgame` context, refactoring it from a modal overlay into a standard, embeddable React component suitable for a page.\n\n4.  **Port and Adapt Sub-Components:** I will replace all placeholder files within `src/components/report-viewer/` with the complete code from their `aiascentgame` counterparts. This includes:\n    *   `PageNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `ImageNavigator.tsx` (with voting UI removed)\n    *   `PromptNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `ReportProgressBar.tsx`\n    *   `ReportTreeNav.tsx`\n    *   `AudioControls.tsx`\n    *   `ReportChatPanel.tsx` (as a simplified placeholder for now).\n    *   All import paths within these files will be updated to point to the new `reportStore` and other local components.\n\n5.  **Create Utility Component:** The report viewer relies on a `MarkdownRenderer` component to display content. I will create a new file `src/components/report-viewer/MarkdownRenderer.tsx` to handle this basic rendering requirement.\n\n6.  **Integrate into Showcase Page:** Finally, I will update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`. I will import the new `ReportViewer.tsx` component and render it, replacing the static \"Loading...\" message. This will activate the entire report viewer system on the page.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n

          "content": "<summary>\nI will begin implementing the AI Ascent Report Viewer on the showcase page. My course of action is to port the necessary components and state management logic from the `aiascentgame` context, adapt them for this project, and integrate them to display the report data.\n\nThis involves:\n1.  **Creating the Report Viewer component structure:** I will create the necessary directories (`src/components/report-viewer`, `src/stores`) and populate them with the component and store files from the provided context.\n2.  **Adapting the Zustand store (`reportStore.ts`):** I will implement the core data loading logic to fetch and process `ai_ascent_report.json` and `imageManifest.json`, reconstructing the full report data in memory. Features not in the immediate scope, such as voting and audio narration, will be stubbed out.\n3.  **Building the main `ReportViewer` component:** This component will replace the placeholder on the showcase page. It will orchestrate the data loading and render the various child components for navigation and content display.\n4.  **Integrating the viewer:** I will update the `/showcase` page to be a client component and embed the new `ReportViewer` to bring the feature to life.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Create `src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** I will copy the extensive state management logic from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`. I will then implement the `loadReportData` function to fetch `/data/ai_ascent_report.json` and `/data/imageManifest.json`. This function will reconstruct the `allPages` array by merging these two data sources, programmatically generating the full image URLs and metadata as required by the viewer components. I will temporarily remove or comment out functionality related to voting, audio playback, and the \"Ask Ascentia\" chat to focus on the core viewing experience.\n\n2.  **Create `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`:** This will be the main container component for the report viewer. It will be a client component that initializes the data loading by calling `loadReportData` from the `reportStore`. It will manage the overall layout, including the conditional rendering of the navigation tree and the main content panel.\n\n3.  **Port Child Components:** I will copy the code for the following components from the `context/aiascentgame/report/` directory into their corresponding new files within `src/components/report-viewer/`:\n    *   `ReportTreeNav.tsx`\n    *   `PageNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `ImageNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `PromptNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `ReportProgressBar.tsx`\n    *   `AudioControls.tsx` (as a placeholder)\n    *   I will update all import paths to match the new project structure and remove props and logic related to the out-of-scope features.\n\n4.  **Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** I will convert this page to a client component (`'use client'`) and replace the current \"Loading...\" placeholder with the newly created `<ReportViewer />` component. This will be the final step to integrate the report viewer into the website.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/stores/reportStore.ts\">\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { create } from

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the request to continue building the report viewer. The core task is to port the fully-featured report viewer from the `aiascentgame` context into the `aiascent.dev` project and display it on the `/showcase` page, replacing the current \"Loading...\" message.\n\nThe curator has already placed the necessary data (`ai_ascent_report.json`), image manifest (`imageManifest.json`), and image assets in the correct `public` directories. My course of action is to port and adapt the React components and the Zustand state management store to create a functional, self-contained report viewer.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `package.json`:** I will add the necessary dependencies for the report viewer component, specifically `zustand` for state management and `re-resizable` for the chat panel's resizable functionality.\n\n2.  **Implement `reportStore.ts`:** I will port the complete state management logic from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts` into `src/stores/reportStore.ts`. I will significantly modify the `loadReportData` function to work with the provided `ai_ascent_report.json` and `imageManifest.json` files, reconstructing the necessary data structures in memory for the components to consume.\n\n3.  **Port Viewer Components:** I will port the full source code for all the individual UI components from the `aiascentgame` context (`AudioControls.tsx`, `ImageNavigator.tsx`, `PageNavigator.tsx`, `PromptNavigator.tsx`, `ReportChatPanel.tsx`, `ReportProgressBar.tsx`, `ReportTreeNav.tsx`) into their respective placeholder files under `src/components/report-viewer/`. I will update all import paths to match the new project structure.\n\n4.  **Create the Main `ReportViewer` Component:** I will adapt the `ReportViewerModal.tsx` from the context into a new, primary component named `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`. This adaptation involves removing the modal-specific logic and converting it into a self-contained component that fetches its data on mount and can be embedded directly onto a page.\n\n5.  **Integrate into Showcase Page:** Finally, I will update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to be a client component, and I will replace the placeholder \"Loading...\" text with the newly created `<ReportViewer />` component, bringing the interactive report to life.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nPlease run `npm install` after these changes to install the new dependencies (`zustand` and `re-resizable`).\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next

The necessary data files (`ai_ascent_report.json`, `imageManifest.json`) and image assets have been placed in the project, but the component itself is just a placeholder. My course of action is to port the complete implementation from the `aiascentgame` context, adapt it for this project, and integrate it into the `/showcase` page.\n\nThis involves porting the Zustand store for state management, adapting the core `ReportViewer` component and its children, creating a new client component to manage data loading, and updating the main showcase page. I will also add the necessary `zustand` dependency to the project.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `package.json`:** Add the `zustand` library, which is required for the report viewer's state management.\n2.  **Implement `src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** Port the full functionality from the `aiascentgame` context. I will update the `loadReportData` function to fetch from the correct local paths (`/data/ai_ascent_report.json` and `/data/imageManifest.json`) and adjust the image URL construction logic to correctly point to the `/assets/images/report/` directory.\n3.  **Create `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`:** Create the main container component by adapting the code from `context/aiascentgame/report/ReportViewerModal.tsx`, removing all modal-specific styling and logic to make it embeddable on a page.\n4.  **Port Child Components:** Port the full code for `PageNavigator.tsx`, `ImageNavigator.tsx`, `PromptNavigator.tsx`, `ReportProgressBar.tsx`, `ReportTreeNav.tsx`, `ReportChatPanel.tsx`, and `AudioControls.tsx` from the `aiascentgame` context into their respective placeholder files. I will temporarily disable the voting and chat features within these components to avoid dependency issues with `next-auth` and `socket.io`, which are not part of this project's current scope.\n5.  **Create `src/components/showcase/ReportViewerClient.tsx`:** Create a new client-side component. This component will be responsible for triggering the data loading from the Zustand store via a `useEffect` hook and then rendering the `<ReportViewer />` component.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the request to implement the AI Ascent Report Viewer. The necessary data and image files are in place, but the component files and state management logic are currently placeholders. My course of action is to port the complete implementation from the `aiascentgame` context, adapt it for this project, and integrate it into the `/showcase` page to replace the current \"Loading...\" message. This involves updating the state management, porting all necessary React components, and ensuring the data paths are correct.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Add Dependencies:** I will add `zustand` to `package.json`, as it is a required dependency for the `reportStore` state management logic.\n2.  **Implement State Management (`reportStore.ts`):** I will replace the placeholder content in `src/stores/reportStore.ts` with the full implementation from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`. I will modify the `loadReportData` function to fetch data from the correct paths (`/data/ai_ascent_report.json` and `/data/imageManifest.json`) and adjust the image URL construction logic to correctly point to the `/assets/images/report/` directory.\n3.  **Port Core Components:** I will port the full source code for the essential report viewer components from the `aiascentgame` context into the `src/components/report-viewer/` directory. This includes:\n    *   `ReportViewerModal.tsx` (which will be refactored into `ReportViewer.tsx`)\n    *   `PageNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `ImageNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `PromptNavigator.tsx`\n    *   `ReportProgressBar.tsx`\n    *   `ReportTreeNav.tsx`\n4.  **Refactor Main Component:** I will adapt the ported `ReportViewerModal.tsx` into a new, non-modal component named `ReportViewer.tsx`. This will involve removing modal-specific styling and logic, making it a self-contained component that can be embedded directly into a page. It will be responsible for initiating the data load.\n5.  **Integrate into Showcase Page:** I will update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to be a client component, import the new `ReportViewer.tsx`, and render it in place of the current \"Loading...\" message.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\":

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the request to implement the AI Ascent Report Viewer. The core task is to port the existing, functional report viewer from the `aiascentgame` context into the `aiascent.dev` project, adapting it from a modal to an embedded page component on `/showcase`. The necessary data and image files have been placed in the `public` directory.\n\nMy course of action is to perform a comprehensive port and adaptation of the report viewer components and its state management logic. This involves replacing all placeholder files with their functional counterparts, updating data loading paths, adapting the UI from a modal to a standard component, and integrating it into the `/showcase` page.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Add Dependencies:** I will update `package.json` to include the `zustand` library, which is essential for the report viewer's state management.\n2.  **Port State Management (`reportStore.ts`):** I will replace the placeholder content in `src/stores/reportStore.ts` with the complete state logic from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`. This includes:\n    *   Implementing the data loading mechanism to fetch `ai_ascent_report.json` and `imageManifest.json`.\n    *   Adding the logic to reconstruct the full report data in memory, correctly resolving image paths to `/assets/images/report/report-3/...`.\n    *   Removing the voting-related state and actions (`castVote`, `imageVotes`, etc.) as specified.\n    *   Keeping the UI state for chat and audio controls but noting their backend functionality is not yet implemented in this project.\n3.  **Port UI Components (`/report-viewer/*`):**\n    *   I will overwrite all placeholder components in `src/components/report-viewer/` with the functional versions from the `aiascentgame` context.\n    *   I will create a new primary component, `ReportViewer.tsx`, adapted from the original `ReportViewerModal.tsx`, removing all modal-specific styling and logic (overlays, fixed positioning) so it can be embedded directly into a page.\n    *   I will update all import paths within the newly ported components to align with the `aiascent.dev` project structure.\n    *   In `ImageNavigator.tsx`, I will remove the UI elements and logic associated with the voting system.\n4.  **Integrate into Showcase Page:** I will modify `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to:\n    *   Use the `'use client'` directive.\n    *   Import and render the main `ReportViewer` component, replacing the current \"Loading...\" placeholder.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu\": \"^2.0.6\",\n    \"@radix-ui/react-slot\": \"^1.0.2\",\n    \"@tsparticles/engine\": \"^3.3.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/react\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@tsparticles/slim\": \"^3.3.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"framer-motion\": \"^11.1.7\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.373.0\",\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"next-themes\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"react-icons\": \"^5.2.1\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.3.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\",\n    \"zustand\": \"^4.5.2\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"yarn@1.22.22+sha512.a6b2f7906b721bba3d67d4aff083df04dad64c399707841b7acf00f6b133b7ac24255f2652fa22ae3534329dc6180534e98d17432037ff6fd140556e2bb3137e\"\n}\n```\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/showcase/page.tsx\">\n'use client';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReportViewer from '@/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer';\n\nexport default function ShowcasePage() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto px-4 py-16 pt-24\">\n      <h1 className=\"text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold mb-4 text-center bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-foreground to-muted-foreground\">\n        The Ascent Report\n      </h1>\n      <p className=\"text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-8 text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto\">\n        Explore a complex interactive report built using the Data Curation Environment.

          "content": "<summary>\nI will implement the AI Ascent Report Viewer on the `/showcase` page. The necessary data and image files are already in place, but the components are currently placeholders. My plan is to port the complete, functional report viewer from the `aiascentgame` context, adapt it for this project, and integrate it into the showcase page.\n\nThis involves a multi-step process:\n1.  **Port State Management:** I will copy the sophisticated `reportStore.ts` from the `aiascentgame` context. This Zustand store contains all the logic for loading the report data, managing navigation state (pages, images), and handling user interactions. I will update its data-fetching paths to point to the `ai_ascent_report.json` and `imageManifest.json` files located in the `public/data` directory.\n2.  **Port and Adapt Components:** I will migrate all the individual React components from the `aiascentgame` context (`ReportViewerModal`, `PageNavigator`, `ImageNavigator`, etc.) into the `src/components/report-viewer/` directory. The main `ReportViewerModal.tsx` will be refactored into a standard `ReportViewer.tsx` component that can be embedded directly into the page, removing its modal-specific logic.\n3.  **Simplify and Integrate:** I will remove features not requested for this version, specifically the voting system which depends on user authentication that is not present in this project.\n4.  **Final Integration:** I will update the `/showcase` page to render the newly ported and adapted `ReportViewer` component, replacing the current \"Loading...\" message. This will bring the interactive report to life.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **`src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** I will replace the placeholder content with the full implementation from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`. I will then modify the `loadReportData` function to fetch data from `/data/ai_ascent_report.json` and `/data/imageManifest.json`. I will also adjust the image URL construction logic to correctly point to the `/assets/images/report/` directory and remove the voting-related actions.\n2.  **`src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`:** I will create this new main component by adapting the code from `context/aiascentgame/report/ReportViewerModal.tsx`. I will strip out the modal-specific wrappers and logic, transforming it into a self-contained page component that orchestrates all other report viewer elements.\n3.  **`src/components/report-viewer/*.tsx` (Sub-components):** I will replace the placeholder content in all the other report viewer components (`PageNavigator`, `ImageNavigator`, `PromptNavigator`, `ReportProgressBar`, `ReportTreeNav`, `AudioControls`, and `ReportChatPanel`) with their full implementations from the `aiascentgame` context. I will update their import paths to align with the new project structure.\n4.  **`ImageNavigator.tsx` Simplification:** I will remove the `useSession` hook and all associated voting logic from `ImageNavigator.tsx` to align with the project scope.\n5.  **`ReportChatPanel.tsx` Simplification:** I will temporarily simplify `ReportChatPanel.tsx` to remove its dependency on `multiplayerStore`, ensuring the UI can render without requiring a full chat backend implementation at this stage.\n6.  **`src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** I will modify this page to import and render the new `ReportViewer` component, making it a client component (`'use client'`) to enable the necessary hooks for state management.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/stores/reportStore.ts\">\n// src/stores/reportStore.ts\n// C12 - Ported from aiascentgame context and adapted for aiascent.dev\n'use client';\n\nimport { create } from 'zustand';\nimport { persist, createJSONStorage } from 'zustand/middleware';\nimport { type ChatMessage } from './chatTypes';

          "content": "<summary>\nI will continue the implementation of the AI Ascent Report Viewer. My plan is to port the necessary components and state management logic from the `aiascentgame` context into the `aiascent.dev` project. I will focus on getting the core functionality—loading data from the provided JSON files and displaying the report content and images—working on the `/showcase` page. To streamline this initial integration, I will temporarily disable features with complex dependencies that don't exist in this project yet, such as the voting system, AI chat, and audio narration.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Add Dependencies:** I will update `package.json` to include the `zustand` state management library, which is essential for the report viewer's operation.\n\n2.  **Port State Management (`reportStore.ts`):** I will replace the placeholder content in `src/stores/reportStore.ts` with the logic from the `aiascentgame` context. I will adapt this code by:\n    *   Updating file paths to fetch `ai_ascent_report.json` and `imageManifest.json` from the `public/data` directory.\n    *   Removing logic related to voting and user sessions (`next-auth`).\n    *   Temporarily removing the AI chat functionality to avoid bringing in complex socket.io dependencies at this stage.\n    *   Replacing custom logger calls with standard `console.log` and `console.error`.\n\n3.  **Port and Adapt Components:** I will port all the necessary React components from `context/aiascentgame/report/` into `src/components/report-viewer/`.\n    *   I will adapt `ReportViewerModal.tsx` into a new, non-modal component named `ReportViewer.tsx` that can be embedded directly into a page.\n    *   I will update the child components (`PageNavigator`, `ImageNavigator`, `PromptNavigator`, etc.), removing UI elements for features I'm temporarily disabling (like the vote and chat buttons).\n    *   For `AudioControls.tsx`, I will keep the UI but stub out the function that calls the non-existent TTS API to prevent runtime errors.\n\n4.  **Integrate into Showcase Page:** Finally, I will update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to be a client component and replace the current \"Loading...\" placeholder with the newly created `ReportViewer` component, bringing the interactive report to life.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n{\n

          "content": "<summary>\nI will implement the AI Ascent Report Viewer on the `/showcase` page. The core of this task involves porting the complete functionality from the `aiascentgame` context, adapting it to the `aiascent.dev` Next.js application structure, and wiring it up to the provided JSON data and image assets.\n\nMy course of action is as follows:\n\n1.  **Add Dependencies:** I will update `package.json` to include the `zustand` state management library, which is essential for the report viewer's functionality.\n2.  **Implement State Management:** I will create the full implementation for `src/stores/reportStore.ts` by adapting the source code from the `aiascentgame` context. This includes:\n    *   Fetching and parsing `ai_ascent_report.json` and `imageManifest.json`.\n    *   Modifying the data loading logic to correctly construct image URLs based on the new `/public/assets/images/report/` directory structure.\n    *   Removing all game-specific logic, particularly the voting system, as requested.\n3.  **Port and Adapt Components:** I will port the full source code for all report viewer components (`ReportViewerModal.tsx`, `ImageNavigator.tsx`, `PageNavigator.tsx`, etc.) into the `src/components/report-viewer/` directory. `ReportViewerModal.tsx` will be refactored into a standard page component named `ReportViewer.tsx`.\n4.  **Integrate into Showcase Page:** I will replace the placeholder \"Loading...\" message on the `/showcase` page. To achieve this, I will create a new client component, `src/app/showcase/ShowcaseClient.tsx`, which will be responsible for mounting the `ReportViewer` and triggering the initial data load. The main `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` will then be updated to render this new client component.\n\nThis comprehensive approach will result in a fully functional, interactive report viewer on the showcase page.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `package.json`:** Add the `zustand` library to handle the report viewer's complex state.\n2.  **Create `src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** Implement the full Zustand store by adapting the logic from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`. This store will manage data loading, navigation state (current page, image), and all user interactions within the viewer. I will modify the data fetching logic to use the correct paths for the JSON files and image assets in this project.\n3.  **Create `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`:** This will be the main container component for the viewer, adapted from the original `ReportViewerModal.tsx`. It will orchestrate the layout of all sub-components.\n4.  **Populate `src/components/report-viewer/`:** I will fill in the placeholder files (`AudioControls.tsx`, `ImageNavigator.tsx`, `PageNavigator.tsx`, `PromptNavigator.tsx`, `ReportProgressBar.tsx`, `ReportTreeNav.tsx`) with their complete source code from the `aiascentgame` context, updating import paths as necessary and removing the voting functionality from `ImageNavigator.tsx`.\n5.  **Create `src/app/showcase/ShowcaseClient.tsx`:** This new client component will be responsible for rendering the `ReportViewer` and initiating the data loading process via a `useEffect` hook.\n6.  **Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** I will replace the current placeholder content with the newly created `<ShowcaseClient />` component to bring the report viewer to life.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"package.json\">\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"aiascent-dev\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the requests for Cycle 13. My course of action is to fully integrate the report viewer into the main site layout, implement the Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality by creating a backend proxy to your vLLM/TTS server, and activate the detailed progress bar logic.\n\nFirst, I will adjust the styling of the report viewer and the showcase page to ensure the main site navigation header is present, providing a clear path back to the homepage.\n\nNext, I will create a new API route (`/api/tts/generate`) that will act as a secure proxy between the website and your TTS server running at the specified IP address. I will then port the complete `AudioControls` component and its associated state management from the `aiascentgame` context, wiring it up to this new backend route to enable audio narration.\n\nFinally, I will replace the placeholder `ReportProgressBar` with the full implementation from the original project, which provides granular progress tracking based on viewed content.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** Ensure the main layout, including the header, is rendered around the `ReportViewer` component.\n2.  **Update `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`:** Modify the component's root styling to remove fixed/absolute positioning, allowing it to render within the standard page flow instead of as a full-screen overlay.\n3.  **Create `src/app/api/tts/generate/route.ts`:** Create a new Next.js API route handler. This backend endpoint will receive text from the client, forward it to the `TTS_SERVER_URL` specified in the environment variables, and stream the resulting audio back to the client. This acts as a secure proxy.\n4.  **Update `src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** Integrate all audio-related state and actions from the `aiascentgame` context version. This includes state for playback status, autoplay, volume, mute, and playback speed, along with the actions to control them.\n5.  **Update `src/components/report-viewer/AudioControls.tsx`:** Replace the current placeholder with the full, functional component from `context/aiascentgame/report/AudioControls.tsx`. I will adapt its `generateAndPlayAudio` function to call our new `/api/tts/generate` backend proxy.\n6.  **Update `src/components/report-viewer/ReportProgressBar.tsx`:** Replace the placeholder component with the full implementation from `context/aiascentgame/report/ReportProgressBar.tsx`. This will enable detailed progress tracking based on which images the user has viewed.\n7.  **Curator Instructions:** Add a `<curator_activity>` block to instruct you to create a `.env.local` file and add the `TTS_SERVER_URL` variable, which is necessary for the backend proxy to connect to your TTS server.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\n1.  Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root directory of your `aiascent-dev` project.\n2.  Add the following line to the `.env.local` file:\n\n    ```\n    TTS_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.85:8880/v1/audio/speech\n    ```\n\n3.  Restart your Next.js development server for the environment variable to be loaded.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/showcase/page.tsx\">\n// src/app/showcase/page.tsx\n'use

Remove fixed/absolute positioning to fit within the page layout. Integrate the new `AudioControls` and `ReportChatPanel` components.\n11. **Provide Curator Instructions:** Add a `<curator_activity>` block with instructions to create a `.env.local` file containing the necessary URLs for the TTS and vLLM servers.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\nPlease create a new file named `.env.local` in the root directory of the `aiascent-dev` project and add the following lines to it.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the request to more deeply integrate the report viewer into the main website, implement Text-to-Speech (TTS), and update the backend integration to support a vLLM service.\n\nMy course of action is as follows:\n\n1.  **Navbar & Layout Integration:** I will modify the Showcase page and the Report Viewer component to ensure the main site navigation is always visible, providing a cohesive user experience and allowing users to easily return to the homepage. This involves adjusting component styling to fit within the standard page layout rather than as a full-screen overlay.\n\n2.  **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Implementation:** I will implement the full TTS functionality. This includes:\n    *   Creating a new API route (`/api/tts/route.ts`) that acts as a secure proxy to the TTS server specified in the environment variables.\n    *   Porting the `AudioControls.tsx` component from the `aiascentgame` context to provide a user interface for playback.\n    *   Updating the `reportStore.ts` Zustand store to manage all audio-related states, such as playback status, progress, and autoplay settings.\n    *   Integrating the audio controls and playback logic into the main `ReportViewer.tsx` component.\n\n3.  **vLLM Chat Scaffolding:** To prepare for the \"coming soon\" chat feature and the switch to vLLM, I will:\n    *   Replace the placeholder `ReportChatPanel.tsx` with the more feature-complete version from the `aiascentgame` context.\n    *   Update `reportStore.ts` to include state management for chat history and user input.\n    *   Create a new backend API route (`/api/chat/route.ts`) to proxy requests to the vLLM server.\n    *   **Adaptation:** I will modify the `ReportChatPanel` to use a standard `fetch` request to our new API route for streaming responses, as this project does not use a WebSocket server like the original `aiascentgame`.\n\n4.  **Environment Setup:** I will create a `.env.example` file to document the necessary `TTS_SERVER_URL` and `VLLM_SERVER_URL` environment variables for the curator.\n\nThis is a comprehensive update that will significantly enhance the report viewer's functionality and its integration within the site.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/app/layout.tsx`:** Wrap the main content in a `div` with top padding to ensure content doesn't appear under the fixed header.\n2.  **Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** Remove the full-screen container and render the `ReportViewer` component directly, allowing it to be part of the standard page flow.\n3.  **Create `.env.example`:** Create this file to document the `TTS_SERVER_URL` and a placeholder for the `VLLM_SERVER_URL`.\n4.  **Create `src/app/api/tts/route.ts`:** Implement the backend API route that will receive text, forward it to the `TTS_SERVER_URL`, and stream the resulting audio back to the client. This acts as a secure proxy.\n5.  **Update `src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** Integrate all state management logic for both TTS audio playback (playback status, autoplay, volume, etc.) and the chat functionality (history, input) from the `aiascentgame` version of the store.\n6.  **Update `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`:** Heavily refactor this component to remove its modal-like, full-screen behavior. It will now render within the main page layout. I will integrate the `AudioControls` and `ReportChatPanel` components and add the necessary `useEffect` hooks to manage keyboard events and audio playback logic.\n7.  **Create `src/components/report-viewer/AudioControls.tsx`:** Port the complete `AudioControls.tsx` component from `context/aiascentgame/report/`. This component includes the UI and logic for playing, pausing, seeking, and managing audio narration. It will be adapted to call our new `/api/tts` endpoint.\n8.  **Update `src/components/report-viewer/ReportChatPanel.tsx`:** Replace the placeholder content with the full implementation from `context/aiascentgame/report/ReportChatPanel.tsx`. I will adapt its communication logic to use `fetch` with streaming against our new `/api/chat` endpoint instead of Socket.IO.\n9.  **Create `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`:** Implement the backend API route that will proxy chat requests to the vLLM server, including support for streaming responses back to the client.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/layout.tsx\">\nimport type { Metadata } from \"next\";\nimport { Inter } from \"next/font/google\";\nimport \"./globals.css\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers/theme-provider\";\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/layout/Footer\";\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: [\"latin\"] });\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: \"AIAscent.dev | Home of the Data Curation Environment\",\n  description: \"The official website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the request for Cycle 13. The primary objectives are to seamlessly integrate the report viewer into the main website layout and to implement a full-featured Text-to-Speech (TTS) narration system. The user has also indicated a backend shift from LM Studio to vLLM and provided a new TTS server endpoint.\n\nMy course of action is as follows:\n\n1.  **Layout Integration:** I will modify the styling of the `ReportViewer` component and its parent page (`/showcase`) to embed it within the standard site layout, ensuring the main navigation header remains visible and functional. This will create a more cohesive user experience, allowing users to navigate back to the homepage easily.\n\n2.  **TTS Backend Proxy:** Since the `aiascent-dev` project is a static Next.js site without a custom server, I will create a new Next.js API route at `src/app/api/tts/route.ts`. This route will act as a secure backend proxy, forwarding text from the client to the TTS server specified by the user (`http://192.168.1.85:8880/v1/audio/speech`) and streaming the resulting audio back. I will also create a `.env.example` file to document the necessary `TTS_SERVER_URL` environment variable.\n\n3.  **TTS Frontend Implementation:**\n    *   I will replace the placeholder `AudioControls.tsx` component with the full-featured version from the `aiascentgame` context. This includes UI elements for play/pause, progress seeking, volume, playback speed, and an autoplay toggle.\n    *   I will significantly update the `reportStore.ts` Zustand store to manage all audio-related states (`playbackStatus`, `currentTime`, `duration`, etc.) and actions. This includes the logic to fetch audio from our new API route and to manage the timers for the synchronized image slideshow and automatic page progression when autoplay is enabled.\n    *   The `ReportViewer.tsx` component will be updated to include the new `AudioControls` and the necessary effects to orchestrate the autoplay functionality.\n\n4.  **Chat Panel Upgrade:** To align with the user's context about moving to vLLM and the more advanced chat features seen in the `vcpg` project, I will replace the current placeholder `ReportChatPanel.tsx` with the full-featured, WebSocket-ready version from the `aiascentgame` context. I will note in my summary that while the UI is now in place, activating the live chat requires a custom server with WebSocket support, which is a distinct architectural task for a future cycle.\n\nThis comprehensive update will deliver the requested core features, transforming the report viewer into a deeply integrated and accessible part of the website.\n\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Integrate Report Viewer Layout:**\n    *   Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to correctly contain the report viewer within the main application layout, removing styles that cause a full-screen takeover.\n    *   Update `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx` to remove fixed positioning, allowing it to render as a standard block component that fills its parent container.\n\n2.  **Implement TTS Backend:**\n    *   Create a new Next.js API route file at `src/app/api/tts/route.ts`.\n    *   Implement a `POST` handler in this route that proxies text-to-speech requests to the external TTS server defined by the `TTS_SERVER_URL` environment variable. It will handle streaming the audio response back to the client.\n    *   Create a `.env.example` file to instruct the curator on setting up the `TTS_SERVER_URL`.\n\n3.  **Implement TTS Frontend:**\n    *   Fully implement `src/components/report-viewer/AudioControls.tsx` by porting the logic and UI from `context/aiascentgame/report/AudioControls.tsx`. This includes adding controls for play/pause, restart, progress seeking, volume, mute, playback speed, and autoplay.\n    *   Update `src/stores/reportStore.ts` to include all necessary state and actions for managing audio playback, slideshows, and autoplay timers, adapting the logic from the `aiascentgame` context.\n    *   Integrate the `AudioControls` component into `ReportViewer.tsx` and add the `useEffect` hooks required to manage the audio and slideshow lifecycle based on store state.\n\n4.  **Upgrade Chat Panel:**\n    *   Replace the content of `src/components/report-viewer/ReportChatPanel.tsx` with the more advanced implementation from `context/aiascentgame/report/ReportChatPanel.tsx`, which includes a proper message display area, input handling, and the UI for future WebSocket integration.\n\n5.  **Update Dependencies and Imports:**\n    *   Review all ported components and update imports (e.g., from `react-icons/fa` to `react-icons/fa6`) to align with the project's current dependencies.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\".env.example\">\n# Example .env.local file\n# Copy this to .env.local and fill in your

          "content": "<summary>\nI will continue building out the report viewer by integrating it more closely with the main website layout and implementing a full-featured Text-to-Speech (TTS) audio narration system.\n\nFirst, I will adjust the showcase page and report viewer component to retain the main site navigation bar, providing a more cohesive user experience and allowing users to easily navigate back to the homepage.\n\nNext, I will implement the TTS functionality. This involves creating a new API route to act as a secure proxy to the user-provided TTS server. I will then port the comprehensive `AudioControls` component and the associated state management logic from the `aiascentgame` context. This will provide a full suite of audio controls, including play/pause, a seekable progress bar, volume controls, playback speed options, and an enhanced autoplay mode that synchronizes narration with an image slideshow and automatically progresses through the report pages.\n\nThis update will significantly enhance the report viewer's functionality, accessibility, and integration with the overall `aiascent.dev` website.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update Showcase Layout:**\n    *   Modify `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to include top padding, ensuring the content appears below the fixed site header.\n    *   Refactor `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx` to remove the `fixed` positioning, allowing it to render within the standard page layout instead of as a full-screen overlay.\n\n2.  **Implement TTS Backend Proxy:**\n    *   Create a new Next.js API route at `src/app/api/tts/route.ts`.\n    *   This route will securely proxy requests from the frontend to the `TTS_SERVER_URL` specified in the environment variables, hiding the local IP address from the client. It will stream the audio response back.\n    *   I will include instructions in the `<curator_activity>` section for creating the necessary `.env.local` file.\n\n3.  **Create Logger Utility:**\n    *   Create a new utility file `src/lib/logger.ts` to provide simple `logInfo`, `logWarn`, and `logError` functions for client-side debugging, which is a dependency for the ported `AudioControls` component.\n\n4.  **Upgrade Report Viewer State Management:**\n    *   Update `src/stores/reportStore.ts` by porting the complete audio state management logic from the `aiascentgame` context. This includes state for playback status, autoplay, audio URLs, timing, volume, and new actions to manage them.\n    *   The `playAscentiaMessage` action will be adapted to use the new `/api/tts` proxy.\n\n5.  **Implement Audio Controls UI:**\n    *   Replace the placeholder content in `src/components/report-viewer/AudioControls.tsx` with the full, feature-rich implementation from the `aiascentgame` context. This includes UI for play/pause, restart, progress seeking, volume, playback speed, and autoplay.\n\n6.  **Integrate TTS into Report Viewer:**\n    *   Update `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx` to include the functional `<AudioControls />` component.\n    *   Add the necessary `useEffect` hooks to manage keyboard events and orchestrate the autoplay functionality (triggering audio generation and slideshows on page changes).\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\n1.  **Create Environment File:**\n    *   In the root directory of your `aiascent-dev` project, create a new file named `.env.local`.\n    *   Add the following line to this file, replacing the IP address if your TTS server is on a different machine:\n        ```\n        TTS_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.85:8880/v1/audio/speech\n        ```\n\n2.  **Restart Development Server:**\n    *   After creating the `.env.local` file, you **must** stop and restart your Next.js development server (`npm run dev`) for the new environment variable to be loaded.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/showcase/page.tsx\">\n// src/app/showcase/page.tsx\n'use

This route will act as a secure proxy, receiving text from the client, forwarding it to the TTS server URL provided (`http://192.168.1.85:8880/v1/audio/speech`), and streaming the audio back.\n    *   I will add a `.env.local.example` file to document the `TTS_SERVER_URL` environment variable.\n\n3.  **TTS Frontend Implementation:**\n    *   I will replace the placeholder `AudioControls.tsx` with a full-featured component adapted from the `aiascentgame` context, including play, pause, restart, progress bar, and autoplay controls.\n    *   I will significantly expand `reportStore.ts` to manage all necessary audio states: playback status, autoplay toggles, audio URLs, timing, and slideshow/page progression logic.\n    *   I will integrate the `AudioControls` into the `ReportViewer.tsx` and implement the `useEffect` hooks required to manage the audio lifecycle and the autoplay functionality (image slideshow and automatic page turning).\n\nThis will result in a more integrated site experience and a fully functional, accessible audio narration feature for the AI Ascent Report.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** Adjust the layout to ensure the `ReportViewer` component is displayed correctly below the fixed site header.\n2.  **Update `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`:** Add `usePathname` to apply active styling to the currently viewed page's navigation link.\n3.  **Create `.env.local.example`:** Create this new file to document the `TTS_SERVER_URL` environment variable for the curator.\n4.  **Create `src/app/api/tts/route.ts`:** Implement the backend API route that will securely proxy TTS requests from the client to the external TTS server.\n5.  **Update `src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** Port all audio-related state and actions from the `aiascentgame` context. This includes state for playback status, autoplay, timers, volume, and actions to manage audio generation and control.\n6.  **Update `src/components/report-viewer/AudioControls.tsx`:** Replace the current placeholder with the full implementation from the `aiascentgame` context, adapting it to call the new `/api/tts` endpoint.\n7.  **Update `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`:** Integrate the new `AudioControls` component and add the necessary `useEffect` hooks to manage the audio lifecycle and orchestrate the autoplay slideshow and page progression features.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/showcase/page.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/app/showcase/page.tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport ReportViewer from

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the request to more tightly integrate the report viewer, implement Text-to-Speech (TTS), and enable the progress bar. My course of action is to first adjust the layout to make the main site navigation persistent, then build out the full TTS functionality by creating a backend API proxy and porting the frontend components and state from the `aiascentgame` context. Finally, I will implement the logic for the report progress bar. This is a comprehensive update that will introduce a backend API route and significantly enhance the interactivity of the report viewer.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Navigation Integration:**\n    *   In `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`, I will remove the screen-height and width constraints to allow the page to fit naturally within the main layout.\n    *   In `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`, I will remove the `fixed inset-0` styling and adjust the height to `calc(100vh - 4rem)` (assuming a 4rem/`h-16` header), making the main site header visible and accessible from the showcase page.\n\n2.  **Implement TTS Backend Proxy:**\n    *   I will create a new Next.js API route at `src/app/api/tts/route.ts`.\n    *   This route will handle `POST` requests, reading the `TTS_SERVER_URL` from an environment variable.\n    *   It will act as a secure proxy, forwarding the text payload to the user-provided TTS server URL (`http://192.168.1.85:8880/v1/audio/speech`) and streaming the resulting audio back to the client. This architecture is based on the successful implementation in the `aiascentgame` project.\n    *   I will include a `<curator_activity>` section with instructions for creating the `.env.local` file to store the `TTS_SERVER_URL`.\n\n3.  **Implement TTS Frontend & State:**\n    *   **State (`src/stores/reportStore.ts`):** I will port all audio-related state variables (`playbackStatus`, `autoplayEnabled`, `currentAudioUrl`, etc.) and actions from the `aiascentgame` version of `reportStore.ts`. The primary action will be responsible for calling our new `/api/tts` endpoint.\n    *   **UI (`src/components/report-viewer/AudioControls.tsx`):** I will port the full implementation of the `AudioControls` component from the `aiascentgame` context. This includes the UI and logic for play/pause, restart, autoplay toggle, a seekable progress bar, volume controls, and playback speed selection.\n    *   **Integration (`src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`):** I will integrate the new `AudioControls` component into the viewer's layout and add the necessary `useEffect` hooks to manage the audio element and handle the autoplay logic when the report page changes.\n\n4.  **Implement Report Progress Bar:**\n    *   **State (`src/stores/reportStore.ts`):** I will add the `seenImages` state management from the `aiascentgame` context, including actions to mark images as seen and find the next unseen image.\n    *   **UI (`src/components/report-viewer/ReportProgressBar.tsx`):** I will port the full logic for the progress bar, which calculates completion percentage based on the `seenImages` map and allows clicking to navigate.\n    *   **Integration (`src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`):** I will add a `useEffect` hook that calls the `markImageAsSeen` action whenever the user navigates to a new image, ensuring the progress bar updates accurately.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\n1.  **Create Environment File:** In the root directory of the `aiascent.dev` project, please create a new file named `.env.local`.\n2.  **Add TTS Server URL:** Add the following line to the `.env.local` file. This is crucial for the TTS functionality to work.\n    ```\n    TTS_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.85:8880/v1/audio/speech\n    ```\n3.  **Restart Development Server:** After creating/modifying the `.env.local` file, you must stop and restart the Next.js development server (`npm run dev`) for the changes to take effect.\n</curator_activity>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/showcase/page.tsx\">\n//

My primary focus will be on integrating the showcase page more seamlessly with the main site by incorporating the global header, implementing the Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality for the report viewer, and updating the necessary configurations to support these changes.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Integrate Global Navigation:**\n    *   I will modify the layout of the `/showcase` page and the `ReportViewer` component itself, removing the full-screen overlay behavior to allow the site's main header and footer to be present. This will provide a clear navigation path back to the homepage and other sections.\n    *   I will enhance the `Header.tsx` component to visually highlight the currently active page link, providing users with clear feedback on their location within the site.\n\n2.  **Implement Text-to-Speech (TTS):**\n    *   I will create a new Next.js API route (`/api/tts/generate`) that will act as a secure proxy to the external TTS server specified by the user (`http://192.168.1.85:8880/v1/audio/speech`). This prevents exposing the TTS server directly to the client.\n    *   I will create a `.env.local.example` file to guide the user in setting up the `TTS_SERVER_URL` environment variable.\n    *   The `reportStore.ts` will be significantly upgraded by merging in the comprehensive audio state management logic from the `aiascentgame` context. This includes states for playback status, autoplay, volume, and progress.\n    *   The placeholder `AudioControls.tsx` will be replaced with the full-featured component from the `aiascentgame` context, which includes the UI and logic for play/pause, progress seeking, and autoplay toggling.\n    *   Finally, I will integrate the new `AudioControls` component into the `ReportViewer` and add the necessary effects to manage the audio lifecycle and autoplay behavior.\n\n3.  **Update Documentation:**\n    *   I will update the `A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md` and `A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md` to reflect the tasks for this cycle and the project's current progress.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/showcase/page.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/app/showcase/page.tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport ReportViewer from \"@/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer\";\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport default function ShowcasePage() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8 h-full\">\n        <ReportViewer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/components/layout/Header.tsx\">\n```tsx\n// src/components/layout/Header.tsx\n'use client'; // Required for usePathname hook\n\nimport Link from 'next/link';\nimport { usePathname } from 'next/navigation';\nimport { ModeToggle } from '@/components/global/mode-toggle';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\nimport { cn } from '@/lib/utils';\n\nconst Header = () => {\n  const pathname = usePathname();\n\n  return (\n    <header className=\"fixed top-0 z-50 w-full border-b border-neutral-800 bg-background/80 backdrop-blur-lg\">\n      <div className=\"container flex h-16 items-center justify-between px-4\">\n        {/* Logo and Title */}\n        <Link href=\"/\" className=\"flex items-center gap-2\">\n          <Image\n            src=\"/assets/logo.svg\"\n            width={30}\n            height={30}\n            alt=\"AIAscent Logo\"\n            className=\"shadow-sm\"\n          />\n          <span className=\"text-2xl font-bold\">AIAscent.dev</span>\n        </Link>\n\n        {/* Navigation Links */}\n        <nav className=\"hidden md:flex items-center space-x-6 text-sm font-medium\">\n          <NavLink href=\"/\" currentPath={pathname}>Home</NavLink>\n          <NavLink href=\"/showcase\" currentPath={pathname}>Showcase</NavLink>\n          <NavLink href=\"/learn\" currentPath={pathname}>Learn</NavLink>\n          <NavLink href=\"/mission\" currentPath={pathname}>Mission</NavLink>\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/dgerabagi/data-curation-environment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"transition-colors hover:text-foreground/80 text-foreground/60\">\n            GitHub\n          </a>\n        </nav>\n\n        {/* Right side (Actions/Toggle) */}\n        <div className=\"flex items-center space-x-4\">\n          <ModeToggle />\n          <div className=\"md:hidden\">\n            {/* Mobile Menu Icon Placeholder */}\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </header>\n  );\n};\n\n// Helper component for navigation links styling\nconst NavLink = ({ href, currentPath, children }: { href: string; currentPath: string; children: React.ReactNode }) => (\n  <Link href={href} className={cn(\n    \"transition-colors hover:text-foreground/80\",\n    currentPath === href ? \"text-foreground\" : \"text-foreground/60\"\n  )}>\n    {children}\n  </Link>\n);\n\nexport default Header;\n```\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\".env.local.example\">\n```\n# This file is an example.

Purpose\n\nThis artifact provides a structured format for tracking development tasks for the `aiascent.dev` website. It organizes work by the group of files involved and estimates complexity (token count and cycle count) to aid in planning for AI-assisted development.\n\n## 2. How to Use\n\n(See M3. Interaction Schema or T17. Template - Universal Task Checklist.md for detailed usage instructions.)\n\n-----\n\n## Task List for Cycle 13+\n\n## T-13: Integrate Global Header and Active Nav Styling\n- **Files Involved:**\n    - `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`\n    - `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`\n    - `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`\n- **Total Tokens:** ~3,000\n- **More than one cycle?** No\n- **Status:** To Do\n\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 13.1):** Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to use a standard page layout instead of a full-screen div.\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 13.2):** Refactor `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx` to remove `fixed inset-0` styling and adapt it to a relative container.\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 13.3):** Convert `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` to a client component and use the `usePathname` hook to apply active styling to the current navigation link.\n\n### Verification Steps\n1.  Navigate to the `/showcase` page.\n2.  **Expected:** The main site header should be visible and functional. The report viewer should render correctly within the page layout, below the header.\n3.  Clicking on different nav links should correctly highlight the active page.\n\n## T-14: Implement Text-to-Speech (TTS)\n- **Files Involved:**\n    - `src/app/api/tts/generate/route.ts` (New)\n    - `.env.local.example` (New)\n    - `src/stores/reportStore.ts`\n    - `src/components/report-viewer/AudioControls.tsx`\n    - `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`\n- **Total Tokens:** ~10,000+\n- **More than one cycle?** Yes\n- **Status:** To Do\n\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 14.1):** Create the TTS proxy API route at `src/app/api/tts/generate/route.ts`.\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 14.2):** Create the `.env.local.example` file with instructions for `TTS_SERVER_URL`.\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 14.3):** Upgrade `src/stores/reportStore.ts` with the full audio state management logic.\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 14.4):** Replace the placeholder `AudioControls.tsx` with the full implementation.\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 14.5):** Integrate the `AudioControls` component into `ReportViewer.tsx` and add autoplay logic.\n\n### Verification Steps\n1.  Open the report viewer on the `/showcase` page.\n2.  **Expected:** The audio controls should be visible. Clicking play should generate and play audio for the current page.\n3.  Toggling \"Autoplay\" should automatically play audio and cycle through images and pages.\n\n## T-15: Plan for Next Cycle\n- **Files Involved:**\n    - `src/Artifacts/A4-Universal-Task-Checklist.md`\n- [ ] **Task (T-ID: 15.1):** Review progress, update this checklist, and prioritize tasks for the subsequent cycle.\n\n-----\n\n## Completed Tasks\n(Previous tasks T-1 through T-12 are omitted for brevity)\n```\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/Artifacts/A11-Implementation-Roadmap.md\">\n```markdown\n# Artifact A11: aiascent.dev - Implementation Roadmap\n\n# Date Created: C0\n\n# Author: AI Model & Curator\n\n# Updated on: C13 (Reflect TTS Implementation)\n\n  - **Key/Value for A0:**\n  - **Description:** A step-by-step roadmap for the implementation of the aiascent.dev website, breaking the development into manageable and testable stages.\n  - **Tags:** roadmap, implementation plan, project management, development stages\n\n## 1. Overview & Goal\n\nThis document provides a clear, step-by-step roadmap for the implementation of **aiascent.dev**. This roadmap breaks the project vision (A1) into smaller, manageable, and testable steps. The goal is to build the functionality incrementally, ensuring a stable foundation at each stage.\n\n## 2. Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Foundational Setup & Scaffolding (Completed)\n\n-   **Goal:** Create the basic project structure and initialize the development environment.\n-   **Outcome:** A runnable Next.js application with the core technical structure in place.\n\n### Step 2: Landing Page UI Development (Completed)\n\n-   **Goal:** Build the main landing page UI and core navigation.\n-   **Outcome:** A visually complete and responsive landing page.\n\n### Step 3: Visual Polish and Theming (Completed)\n\n-   **Goal:** Address outstanding visual bugs and implement a comprehensive light mode theme.\n-   **Outcome:** A polished, professional website that looks great in both dark and light modes.\n\n### Step 4: Core Content Pages (Completed)\n\n-   **Goal:** Resolve 404s by creating the main content pages.\n-   **Outcome:** All main navigation links lead to functional pages.\n\n### Step 5: Interactive Showcase Implementation (Completed)\n\n-   **Goal:** Develop the core feature of Phase 1 by porting and integrating the AI Ascent Report Viewer.\n-   **Outcome:** A functional interactive showcase that displays the full AI Ascent Report on the `/showcase` page.\n\n### Step 6: Feature Expansion and Integration (Cycle 13+)\n\n-   **Goal:** Enhance the report viewer with TTS and better integrate it with the site's overall navigation.\n-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Navigation Integration:** Ensure the global site header is present on the showcase page and indicates the active page.\n    2.  **TTS Implementation:** Integrate the Text-to-Speech functionality, including a backend proxy, state management, and UI controls.\n    3.  **Homepage Integration:** (Next) Adapt the report viewer to display the smaller whitepaper on the homepage.\n    4.  **Learn Page Integration:** (Future) Enhance the viewer to support a curriculum of multiple reports.\n-   **Outcome:** A more immersive and navigable user experience.\n\n### Step 7: Final Polish and Deployment (Future)\n\n-   **Goal:** Prepare for deployment.\n-   **Tasks:**\n    1.  **Final Polish & Testing:** Conduct thorough cross-browser/device testing.\n    2.  **Deployment:** Configure the hosting

          "content": "<summary>\nI have analyzed the request to more tightly integrate the report viewer with the main site, implement Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality, and update the progress bar logic.\n\nMy course of action is as follows:\n\n1.  **Integrate the Main Navigation:** I will modify the layout of the showcase page and the `ReportViewer` component to ensure the main site header is always visible. This will provide a consistent navigation experience and allow users to easily return to the homepage or other sections of the site.\n\n2.  **Implement Text-to-Speech (TTS):**\n    *   **Backend Proxy:** I will create a new API route (`/api/tts`) that will act as a secure proxy. It will receive text from the report viewer, forward it to the specified `TTS_SERVER_URL` (from the `.env.local` file), and stream the resulting audio back to the client. This approach keeps the TTS server endpoint secure and allows for server-side control.\n    *   **Frontend Integration:** I will port the complete `AudioControls` component and all related state management logic from the `aiascentgame` context. This includes implementing the UI for play/pause, progress, volume, and autoplay, as well as the logic to fetch and manage the audio stream from our new backend endpoint.\n\n3.  **Refactor the Progress Bar:** I will replace the current placeholder progress bar with the more advanced version from the `aiascentgame` context. I will then refactor its logic to track progress based on *pages viewed* rather than *images seen*, as requested. This will involve updating the `reportStore` to track seen pages and modifying the component to reflect this new state.\n\nThis is a significant feature update that will greatly enhance the interactivity and accessibility of the report viewer.\n\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Environment Setup:** Create `.env.local` and `.env.example` files to store the `TTS_SERVER_URL`.\n2.  **Layout Integration:**\n    *   Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to ensure it renders within the main site layout, leaving space for the header.\n    *   Refactor `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx` to be a container-aware component instead of a fixed overlay.\n3.  **Backend TTS Proxy:**\n    *   Create a new API route at `src/app/api/tts/route.ts`.\n    *   Implement a `POST` handler that securely proxies text-to-speech requests to the external TTS server specified in the environment variables.\n4.  **Frontend State for Audio:**\n    *   Update `src/stores/reportStore.ts` by porting all audio-related state and actions (playback status, autoplay, volume, etc.) from the `aiascentgame` context's `reportStore.ts`.\n5.  **Frontend UI for Audio:**\n    *   Replace the placeholder `src/components/report-viewer/AudioControls.tsx` with the full, functional component from the `aiascentgame` context.\n    *   Integrate the new `AudioControls` into the `ReportViewer.tsx` component.\n6.  **Progress Bar Refactor:**\n    *   Replace the placeholder `src/components/report-viewer/ReportProgressBar.tsx` with the more feature-rich version from the `aiascentgame` context.\n    *   Update `src/stores/reportStore.ts` to add a `seenPages` state tracker.\n    *   Modify page navigation actions (`nextPage`, `prevPage`, `goToPageByIndex`) to update the `seenPages` state.\n    *   Update the `ReportProgressBar.tsx` component to derive its progress from the `seenPages` state against the total number of pages.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\".env.example\">\n# This is an example environment file.\n# Copy this to .env.local and fill

          "content": "<summary>\nI will integrate the showcase page with the main website layout, implement the Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality for the report viewer, and upgrade the placeholder chat panel to connect to the new vLLM backend.\n\nFirst, I'll adjust the styling of the report viewer and the showcase page to ensure the main site navigation header is always visible, providing a cohesive user experience.\n\nNext, I will implement the full TTS feature. This involves creating a new API route in the Next.js backend to act as a secure proxy to the TTS server address you provided. I will then port the `AudioControls` component and the necessary state management logic from the `aiascentgame` context, adapting it to work within this project.\n\nFinally, I will replace the placeholder \"Ask @Ascentia\" chat panel with a functional version, also ported from the `aiascentgame` context. I will create another new API route to handle streaming chat responses from your vLLM endpoint, refactoring the component to use this modern, HTTP-based approach instead of its original WebSocket implementation. This provides a robust foundation for the interactive chat feature.\n\nI am deferring the request to change the report viewer's progress bar to represent site-wide navigation, as this conflicts with its primary function of tracking progress within the report itself. This may be a point for future clarification.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Integrate Showcase Page Layout:**\n    *   Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to render the `ReportViewer` within the main site layout, ensuring the header is visible.\n    *   Modify `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx` to remove fixed/absolute positioning so it correctly fits within its parent container.\n    *   Update `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` to ensure all navigation links are correct and functional.\n\n2.  **Implement Text-to-Speech (TTS):**\n    *   Create a new API route at `src/app/api/tts/route.ts` that will act as a proxy. It will receive text, forward it to the `TTS_SERVER_URL` specified in the environment variables, and stream the audio response back to the client.\n    *   Port the `AudioControls.tsx` component from `context/aiascentgame/report/` to `src/components/report-viewer/`.\n    *   Update the ported `AudioControls.tsx` to call our new `/api/tts` endpoint.\n    *   Merge the extensive audio-related state management logic (playback status, autoplay, volume, etc.) from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts` into the existing `src/stores/reportStore.ts`.\n    *   Integrate the new `<AudioControls />` component into `ReportViewer.tsx`.\n\n3.  **Upgrade Chat Panel for vLLM:**\n    *   Replace the content of `src/components/report-viewer/ReportChatPanel.tsx` with the more feature-complete version from `context/aiascentgame/report/ReportChatPanel.tsx`.\n    *   Create a new streaming API route at `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` to proxy requests to the vLLM endpoint.\n    *   Refactor the chat panel's communication logic, replacing its original `socket.io` implementation with a modern `fetch`-based approach that consumes the new streaming API route.\n\n4.  **Provide Curator Instructions:**\n    *   Add a `<curator_activity>` block with instructions to create a `.env.local` file and add the `TTS_SERVER_URL` and a new `VLLM_SERVER_URL` for local development.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<curator_activity>\n1.  Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root directory of the `aiascent-dev` project.\n2.  Add the following lines to the new `.env.local` file.

          "content": "<summary>\nThis cycle will focus on fully integrating the AI Ascent Report Viewer into the website, addressing the key feedback points from Cycle 12.\n\nFirst, I will integrate the main site navigation into the `/showcase` page, allowing users to easily return to the homepage. This will be achieved by wrapping the showcase page in the standard site layout.\n\nNext, I will implement the Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality. This involves porting the complete `AudioControls` component and its related state management from the `aiascentgame` context. A new API route will be created to act as a secure proxy between the website and the user's local TTS server, configured via an environment variable.\n\nSimilarly, I will implement the \"Ask @Ascentia\" chat feature. I will port the full `ReportChatPanel` component and its associated logic, creating another backend proxy route to handle communication with the user's local vLLM server. This will enable interactive, AI-powered conversations about the report's content.\n\nFinally, I will update the `ReportProgressBar` to its full functionality, which tracks progress *within the report*, clarifying that using it for site-wide navigation would be a poor user experience. This comprehensive update will bring the report viewer to feature-parity with its original implementation and seamlessly integrate it into the `aiascent.dev` site structure.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Navigation Integration:**\n    *   Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx` to remove the full-screen container, allowing it to render within the standard site layout provided by `src/app/layout.tsx`.\n    *   Modify `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx` to ensure its styling is compatible with a standard page flow rather than a full-screen modal. The `fixed inset-0` classes will be removed.\n    *   Update `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` to ensure the navigation links are correct and functional.\n\n2.  **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Implementation:**\n    *   Create a new API route at `src/app/api/tts/route.ts` to act as a proxy, forwarding requests to the TTS server URL defined in an environment variable. This will handle streaming audio data back to the client.\n    *   Create a `.env.local` file with the variable `TTS_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.85:8880/v1/audio/speech`.\n    *   Add `.env.local` to the `.gitignore` file.\n    *   Replace the placeholder `src/components/report-viewer/AudioControls.tsx` with the full, functional component from `context/aiascentgame/report/AudioControls.tsx`.\n    *   Update the `fetch` call in the new `AudioControls.tsx` to point to the internal `/api/tts` proxy route.\n    *   Merge all audio-related state and actions from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts` into `src/stores/reportStore.ts`.\n    *   Integrate the `<AudioControls />` component into the main `ReportViewer.tsx` component.\n\n3.  **\"Ask @Ascentia\" (vLLM) Implementation:**\n    *   Create a new API route at `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` to proxy streaming chat completion requests to the vLLM server.\n    *   Update the `.env.local` file with `VLLM_URL=http://192.168.1.85:8000/v1/completions`, noting that the port is an assumption and may need curator correction.\n    *   Replace the placeholder `src/components/report-viewer/ReportChatPanel.tsx` with the full implementation from `context/aiascentgame/report/ReportChatPanel.tsx`.\n    *   Update the chat panel's logic to communicate with the `/api/chat` proxy route.\n    *   Merge all chat-related state and actions into `src/stores/reportStore.ts`.\n\n4.  **Final Component Integration:**\n    *   Update `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx` to correctly render and manage the state of the newly implemented `AudioControls` and `ReportChatPanel`.\n    *   Replace the placeholder `src/components/report-viewer/ReportProgressBar.tsx` with the full implementation from `context/aiascentgame/report/ReportProgressBar.tsx`. The functionality will remain focused on tracking progress within the report.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\".gitignore\">\n# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring files.\n\n# dependencies\n/node_modules\n/.pnp\n.pnp.js\n\n# testing\n/coverage\n\n# next.js\n/.next/\n/out/\n\n# production\n/build\n\n# misc\n.DS_Store\n*.pem\n\n# debug\nnpm-debug.log*\nyarn-debug.log*\nyarn-error.log*\n\n# local env files\n.env.local\n.env.development.local\n.env.test.local\n.env.production.local\n\n# vercel\n.vercel\n</file_artifact>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/api/chat/route.ts\">\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport const runtime = 'edge';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  try {\n    const { prompt, pageContext } = await req.json();\n    const vllmUrl = process.env.VLLM_URL;\n\n    if (!vllmUrl) {\n      throw new Error('VLLM_URL is not defined in environment variables.');\n    }\n\n    const fullPrompt = `You are Ascentia, an AI guide.

          "content": "<summary>\nThis cycle addresses the user's request to more tightly integrate the report viewer with the main website, implement Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality, and begin scaffolding the \"Ask @Ascentia\" chat feature using the new vLLM backend context.\n\nMy course of action is as follows:\n\n1.  **Layout Integration:** I will modify the main layout and the showcase page to ensure the site's header is always visible, providing a clear navigation path back to the homepage from the report viewer. The report viewer itself will be adjusted to fit within this standard page layout rather than being a full-screen modal.\n\n2.  **TTS Implementation:** I will create a new backend API route (`/api/tts/route.ts`) to act as a secure proxy for the TTS server. I will then port the `AudioControls.tsx` component and all related state management from the `aiascentgame` context into the `reportStore`, wiring it up to call our new backend endpoint. This will enable full audio narration of the report content.\n\n3.  **\"Ask @Ascentia\" Scaffolding:** Leveraging the provided `vcpg` context for vLLM integration, I will create a backend API route (`/api/chat/route.ts`) to proxy requests to the local vLLM. I will also port the `ReportChatPanel.tsx` component and integrate the necessary state management for a fully functional, streaming chat interface.\n\n4.  **Component Refactoring:** The existing placeholder `ReportViewer.tsx` will be replaced with the more feature-complete `ReportViewerModal.tsx` from the `aiascentgame` context, which will be refactored to serve as the main, non-modal component. The `reportStore` will be significantly upgraded by merging the comprehensive logic from the `aiascentgame` version, which already includes state for TTS and chat.\n\nThis is a significant feature update that will bring the report viewer to life with audio narration and interactive chat capabilities, while seamlessly integrating it into the main website's user experience.\n</summary>\n\n<course_of_action>\n1.  **Update `src/app/layout.tsx`:** Ensure the `<Header />` and `<Footer />` components are rendered for all pages, providing persistent site navigation.\n2.  **Update `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`:** Modify the showcase page to render the `ReportViewer` within a standard page layout, adding padding to account for the fixed header.\n3.  **Replace `src/stores/reportStore.ts`:** Overwrite the existing placeholder store with the complete, feature-rich version from `context/aiascentgame/report/reportStore.ts`. This version includes all necessary state and actions for TTS, chat, progress tracking, and more. I will adapt its API calls to point to the new backend routes.\n4.  **Replace `src/components/report-viewer/ReportViewer.tsx`:** Replace the placeholder component with the content of `context/aiascentgame/report/ReportViewerModal.tsx`. I will refactor it to remove modal-specific logic and adapt it to function as the main page component, integrating the new `AudioControls` and `ReportChatPanel`.\n5.  **Create `src/components/report-viewer/AudioControls.tsx`:** Copy this component from the `aiascentgame` context to provide the UI for the new TTS feature.\n6.  **Create `src/components/report-viewer/ReportChatPanel.tsx`:** Copy this component from the `aiascentgame` context to provide the UI for the \"Ask @Ascentia\" feature. I will adapt its fetch requests to use the new API route.\n7.  **Create `src/app/api/tts/route.ts`:** Create a new Next.js API Route Handler to act as a backend proxy. It will receive text from the client, forward it to the `TTS_SERVER_URL` provided by the user, and stream the resulting audio back.\n8.  **Create `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`:** Create another API Route Handler to proxy chat requests to the vLLM server endpoint (`http://192.168.1.85:1234/v1/completions`), based on the `vcpg` context. This will handle prompt construction and stream the LLM's response back to the client.\n</course_of_action>\n\n<file path=\"src/app/layout.tsx\">\nimport type { Metadata } from \"next\";\nimport { Inter } from \"next/font/google\";\nimport \"./globals.css\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers/theme-provider\";\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/layout/Footer\";\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: [\"latin\"] });\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: \"AIAscent.dev | Home of the Data Curation Environment\",\n  description: \"The official website for the Data Curation Environment (DCE) VS Code Extension.

It aims to be more than a static landing page; it will be a living testament to the capabilities of the DCE by showcasing complex, interactive components that were themselves built using the extension."
